We work to meet growing demands for energy and chemical products while advancing other priorities such as economic growth, environmental protection, education, poverty reduction, health, security and human rights.\\nI\\'m proud of the role we play in raising living standards. Millions of people have escaped extreme poverty in the last two decades due in part to increased access to energy.\\nThe energy we produce is important. So is the way we produce it.\\nThe men and women of ExxonMobil are focused on meeting society\\'s dual challenge  meeting energy needs while also minimizing the environmental impacts of energy use, including the risks of climate change. It\\'s one of society\\'s largest and most complex challenges and requires thoughtful engagement at all levels, focusing on practical and affordable solutions that work at the necessary scale.\\nAt ExxonMobil, we work extensively to reduce emissions and other environmental impacts of energy use in our operations and through the products we sell. We\\'re also a leader in researching and developing energy technologies, like algae biofuels and carbon capture, utilization and storage, that could potentially play a role in helping mitigate the risks of climate change.\\nAnother key sustainability focus is health. We directly impact this through our commitment to the safety of our\\n\\nworkers and members of communities where we work. We continue to make good progress toward our goal of Nobody Gets Hurt. In 2017, we had the fewest recordable injuries in our company\\'s history. In the communities where we operate, we routinely dialogue with local officials responsible for emergency response, health, safety and environmental protection. Our commitment to communities extends well beyond health and safety. We work to enhance economic development by hiring and training qualified local workers and making local investments. At ExxonMobil we are committed to creating long-term shareholder value by making a positive contribution to society. I hope you find this report helpful in understanding our approach. We welcome your feedback at exxonmobil.com/ sustainabilityreport.\\nDarren Woods Chairman and CEO\\n\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\n3\\n\\x0cExxonMobil and sustainability\\nExxonMobil\\'s primary responsibility is to produce the energy and products the world needs in a responsible manner. Our approach to sustainability focuses on six key areas:\\n Corporate governance  Safety, health and the workplace  Managing the risks of climate change  Environmental performance  Community engagement and human rights  Local development and supply chain management\\nFor an in-depth analysis of our financial performance and investment decisions, see our 2017 Digital Annual Report.

In that time, the company has acted on many of our recommendations and we are encouraged by the progress. This year, the company has transitioned from a corporate citizenship report to a sustainability report, which connotes a greater sense of connectedness to global issues and deeper integration with corporate strategy. During our engagement period in 2017-2018, we had the opportunity to observe increased executive engagement in sustainability. Through meetings with the Chairman and CEO, and other senior business leaders in executive, operational and functional roles, we were able to engage the company on transparency, policy and strategy.\\nThis letter represents our individual and collective views on the quality and progress made in ExxonMobil\\'s sustainability reporting and transparency. In recognition of our efforts, ExxonMobil provided a donation on behalf of the panelists to nonprofit organizations of our choice and reimbursed relevant travel expenses. This letter is not an official endorsement of ExxonMobil\\'s sustainability report, the corporation, or its policies and strategies.\\nFor past panel feedback statements, visit: exxonmobil.com/sustainabilityreport\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\nLinking sustainability to corporate strategy\\nClimate change, sustainable development and human rights are among the most pressing challenges facing society. Companies are responding by aligning their core business strategy around global initiatives that seek to address these trends -- the Paris Agreement, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). We recognize ExxonMobil\\'s progress in responding to these international issues and goals. We hope that the company will take further steps to demonstrate how climate change, the SDGs, human rights and other sustainability-related challenges link directly with corporate investments and programs central to its long-term business strategy. We also recommend that the sustainability report include more information on how the company is aligning its long-term business strategy and sustainability strategy, along with the risks and opportunities created by these issues.\\nCommunicating the urgency of climate change\\nWe commend ExxonMobil for the significant steps the company has taken over the past year to address climate change. Publication of the Energy and Carbon Summary in early 2018 is a crucial step demonstrating the company\\'s progress in managing climate risk and responding to shareholder concerns. Continued investment in emerging energy technology research as well as dedicated efforts to reduce methane emissions are other areas of notable progress, alongside the company\\'s decision to participate in collective action platforms such as the Climate Leadership Council and global Methane Guiding Principles, and its public support for the Paris Agreement. The company\\'s recent announcement of efforts to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions from flaring and methane emissions through quantified reductions\\n\\nof 25 percent and 15 percent respectively, by 2020, is a significant step forward.\\nDue to the possible negative impacts climate change poses to business operations, human rights and economic development around the world, we urge further integration of climate change into the core of ExxonMobil\\'s business strategy. This includes through continued operational upgrades and nearand long-term research and product development programs.\\nPerhaps most important, we encourage ExxonMobil to lead by example and be bold in its interaction with governments, industry, academic institutions and civil society organizations in the development of public policies that reduce the threat of climate change.\\nMeasuring performance and impact\\nDisclosure of future targets in addition to current performance data is becoming standard practice in corporate sustainability reporting. There is a growing movement where companies are publicly articulating \"science-based targets\" that align with current climate science. ExxonMobil\\'s report thoroughly discloses current and past performance data. As mentioned, we value the recent announcement of forward-looking greenhouse gas reduction measures and would suggest a similar approach for other material issues. Disclosure of the company\\'s most material and salient internal goals provides opportunity for external stakeholders to independently assess the company\\'s strategy and future performance.\\nStronger statements can also be added on the outcomes or impacts arising from the company\\'s programs. Corporate investments and other performance data should be coupled directly with tangible impacts and outcomes that demonstrate ExxonMobil\\'s impact on society. For example, the report discusses the amount of capital invested in developing energy\\n\\n6\\n\\x0csolutions with lower emissions. Emphasis could be added on the actual or potential impact of these investments for society. Describing a specific successful technology that resulted, or could result, from this investment could be more compelling than disclosing financial investment data alone. Incorporating these outcomes creates a more engaging report that demonstrates the types of impacts the company is creating for the environment, people and industry.\\nWith respect to human rights, we recommend that the company be bold in stating its objective of no harm. Through many rigorous due diligence processes, ExxonMobil\\'s approach to human rights, for example, closely aligns with the UNGPs. Greater specificity about practices and performance in this area would help the company align its reporting more effectively with societal and industry expectations of best practices. Measuring the impact on human rights quantitatively is difficult. Nevertheless, the company is already assessing impacts on staff and on communities in its areas of operation. We encourage it to expand efforts through further identification of potential adverse impacts, explaining processes used to identify these, and describing steps taken to mitigate them.\\nEngaging strategically with stakeholders\\nCompanies like ExxonMobil have to understand and balance the needs of numerous individual and institutional stakeholders across different value chains and a wide range of cultures, regulations and operating environments. Some relationships are indirect and simple, while others are very complex. ExxonMobil\\'s current disclosure around stakeholder engagement is not sufficiently specific, which can create the perception that the company is not fully disclosing engagement activities. We recommend that ExxonMobil describe its stakeholders and their priorities more explicitly, and how the\\n\\ncompany has addressed their concerns. We also recommend that ExxonMobil describe limitations encountered with stakeholder interactions in countries where open consultation is difficult.\\nWe appreciate that the company publishes a list of its political contributions and philanthropic giving to non-lobbying and nonprofit organizations. In the future, we would like to see more about the relationship between its contributions and its specific sustainability goals and/or programs.\\nConcluding remarks\\nWe recognize the progress that ExxonMobil has made over the past year in publicly addressing complex sustainability issues and call on the company to drive this agenda forward, both through business activities and value chains, as well as through strategic partnerships with others. We encourage the company and its executives to be even more bold and transparent in all aspects of sustainability performance. ExxonMobil is a global leader that others follow in many areas of the energy industry. We believe that taking an increasingly ambitious, evidencebased and technologically innovative position on sustainability issues will provide the company with the opportunity to champion more substantial sustainability efforts worldwide, and to enhance long-term shareholder value.\\nSincerely,\\nCraig Benson, Mark Cohen, Frank Loy, Jane Nelson, Salil Tripathi\\nJune 2018\\n\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\nExternal Sustainability Advisory Panel statement\\nExternal Sustainability Advisory Panel\\nExxonMobil\\'s External Sustainability Advisory Panel is composed of academics, nongovernmental organization representatives and former government employees who have expertise in a variety of environmental, social and governance topics.

From the left: Frank Loy, Salil Tripathi, Jane Nelson, Darren Woods, Craig Benson and Mark Cohen.\\n7\\n\\x0cAddressing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals\\nThe United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to make significant progress on global economic, social and environmental challenges by 2030. While ExxonMobil contributes to certain aspects of all 17 SDGs, the following eight represent those most relevant to ExxonMobil\\'s sustainability focus areas.\\nLearn more about how ExxonMobil contributes to the UN SDGs at exxonmobil.com/sustainabilityreport.\\nSDG Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere United Nations data shows a strong correlation between energy use and improved standards of living. ExxonMobil is working to help lift people out of poverty around the world by expanding access to affordable and versatile energy supplies. In addition, ExxonMobil collaborates with host governments and other local stakeholders to implement community investments that improve health and education, and help build and sustain local economic growth.\\nSDG Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages ExxonMobil supports the health, safety and well-being of our employees while also making investments to support community health systems and programs. For example,\\n\\nsince 2001, we have funded antimalarial programs that have reached more than 125 million people. Another example is our U.S.-based Culture of Health program that provides health education, nutrition and fitness programs that support the well-being of our employees. We are expanding the program to other countries as well.\\nSDG Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all\\nWe invest in education and teacher development programs, placing a specific emphasis on encouraging students to pursue careers in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields. Since 2000, we have contributed more than $1.25 billion to education programs around the world.\\nSDG Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\\nSince 2005, ExxonMobil has invested $111 million in programs that develop female entrepreneurs and business leaders and improve women\\'s ability to advance. Internally, ExxonMobil promotes leadership development for women during all aspects of their careers, including through training and mentoring.\\nSDG Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all\\nExxonMobil delivers reliable and affordable energy that helps fuel economic activity and improve standards of living. Natural gas, for example, supplies 22 percent of the world\\'s energy and has a lower carbon footprint than other traditional energy sources. In addition, ExxonMobil is researching loweremission technologies, such as algae biofuels and advanced carbon capture. We have invested more than $9 billion since 2000 on lower-emission energy solutions.\\n\\nSDG Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all\\nWhen working in a community, we add economic and social value by creating local jobs, supporting local supplier development and providing opportunities through training and investments. We employ nearly 70,000 people around the world.\\nSDG Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns\\nExxonMobil is working to make our operations more efficient while also helping our customers to reduce their emissions. These solutions include creating advanced plastics and other materials that can be used in a range of consumer products to reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency, and by developing premium, high-efficiency fuels and lubricants.\\nSDG Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\\nMeeting the world\\'s growing energy demand while simultaneously reducing environmental impacts, including the risks of climate change, is one of society\\'s most pressing challenges. We are focused on mitigating emissions in our operations, developing technology solutions, providing solutions that reduce emissions for our customers and engaging on climate change policy. We are a founding member of the Climate Leadership Council, which advocates for a revenue-neutral carbon tax and aligns closely with our long-standing principles. In 2018, we joined the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, a voluntary initiative representing 13 of the world\\'s largest oil and gas producers working towards solutions to mitigate the risks of climate change.\\n\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\n8\\n\\x0cCorporate governance\\n\\nExxonMobil has a long-standing commitment to high ethical standards. Good corporate governance creates a business environment conducive to long-term growth. All our directors are required to stand for election each year at our annual meeting of shareholders. Independent directors also chair key board committees -- audit, compensation, board affairs and public issues and contributions -- that consist entirely of independent directors.\\n\\nAbove: The ExxonMobil board of directors. Top row from the left: Michael Boskin, Angela Braly, Steven Kandarian, Samuel Palmisano, Darren Woods, Kenneth Frazier, Douglas Oberhelman and Ursula Burns. Bottom row from the left: Steven Reinemund, Susan Avery and William Weldon.\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\n\"ExxonMobil\\'s board of directors provides a key oversight role, including review of risk management efforts and long-term strategic plans. Ensuring that we have diversity of background, experiences and thought represented on the board remains critical to succeeding in a global market.\"\\nNeil A. Hansen\\nVice president, investor relations and corporate secretary, Exxon Mobil Corporation\\n9\\n\\x0cBoard leadership\\nExxonMobil\\'s board affairs committee, supported by an independent executive search firm, looks for highly qualified, non-employee candidates with demonstrated leadership, competency and a commitment to represent the interests of all shareholders. To help keep the process collaborative and inclusive, the board affairs committee considers recommendations from shareholders, directors and others on director candidates. At year-end 2017, 40 percent of the board\\'s independent directors were female and/or an ethnic minority.\\nSustainability topics are routinely reviewed at board meetings and typically fall under the purview of the public issues and contributions committee, the board affairs committee and the compensation committee. While risk oversight is the responsibility of the entire board, committees help the board focus on risk aspects relevant to each committee. For example, the public issues and contributions committee is charged with reviewing the effectiveness of the company\\'s policies, programs and practices with respect to the environment, among other duties. The committee hears reports from operating units on environmental activities and also visits operating sites to observe and comment on current practices. The entire board receives briefings by internal experts on environmental stewardship and climate change.\\n\\nCorporate governance\\nboard decided to further enhance the company\\'s disclosures consistent with the proposal and issued these disclosures in February 2018 in ExxonMobil\\'s Energy and Carbon Summary and the Outlook for Energy. These enhancements include energy demand sensitivities, implications of 2 degree Celsius scenarios and positioning for a lower-carbon future.\\nBusiness conduct\\nOperating ethically and responsibly is ingrained in our business culture and is monitored, enforced and improved through our globally deployed Standards of Business Conduct. In 2017, nearly 18,000 employees and contractors participated in anti-corruption training.\\nExxonMobil encourages employees and contractors to ask questions, voice concerns and report any suspected violations of company policies. In addition to our open-door communication procedures, ExxonMobil has several confidential mechanisms for reporting, including a 24-hour \"hotline\" phone number and a mailing address.\\n\\nShareholder relations\\nExxonMobil values the dialogue we have with our shareholders -- and the insight provided -- throughout the year. The board has established procedures for shareholders and other interested parties to communicate with board members. In 2017, we held 68 shareholder engagements on environmental, social and governance issues with institutional investors, pension funds, labor, religious and nongovernmental organizations, representing an estimated 50 percent of outstanding stock held by institutional investors and about 30 percent of total shares outstanding. These engagements have frequently enabled us to reach common ground with our shareholders, in some cases avoiding the need for more formal shareholder proposals at the annual shareholders meeting.\\nConsistent with ExxonMobil\\'s Corporate Governance Guidelines, the board of directors reconsidered a proposal requesting a report on impacts of climate change policies (Item 12) submitted by the New York State Common Retirement Fund, which received a majority of votes cast during the 2017 annual shareholders meeting. In reconsidering the proposal, the company sought input from a number of parties, such as the proponents and major shareholders.

We appreciate the need for relevant public and private company government payment disclosures to confirm the values of total government revenues and to help citizens hold their governments accountable for the use of those revenues.\\nWe believe the most successful transparency initiatives are those that apply to all foreign, domestic and state-owned companies, protect proprietary information to promote commercial competitiveness, comply with international trade conventions and treaties and do not violate host government laws or contractual obligations. We monitor and participate in transparency initiatives and we will continue to work with governments developing new reporting rules to support transparency objectives in countries where we operate.\\nSince its inception, we have been an active participant in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) -- a global organization that promotes the open and accountable management of oil, gas and mineral resources. We work with several governments that are EITI members, as well as others considering membership.\\n\\nCorporate governance\\npolitical organizations as permitted by applicable laws in the United States and Canada. In 2017, we contributed over $210,000 to state candidates and caucuses in 10 U.S. states. Corporate political contributions are subject to an internal review process that requires approval from the chairman.\\n\\nPolicy engagement\\nExxonMobil engages with governments to provide information and insight on policies that can affect our business. In 2017, ExxonMobil reported lobbying expenses in the United States totaling $11.4 million in our public Lobby Disclosures Act filings.

The health and safety policies set by ExxonMobil and adopted by our affiliates reflect our company\\'s commitment to high operational standards and the well-being of our employees. We strive for an incident-free workplace and a culture that complies with our clear and simple objective: Nobody Gets Hurt. We build our culture of safety and health by attracting, developing and retaining individuals who share our commitment to operational excellence.\\n\"In 2017 ExxonMobil achieved our lowest ever recordable injury rate as we continue working to eliminate all serious injuries. These improvements are supported by enhanced safety standards, strengthened safety leadership skills and human performance improvement programs. All of which are worked under our Operational Integrity Management System framework.\"\\nJerry Wascom\\nVice president, operational excellence, safety, security, health and environment, Exxon Mobil Corporation\\n12\\n\\x0cSafety and health\\nExxonMobil\\'s commitment to operational excellence starts at the top, is driven throughout our businesses and is consistent everywhere we operate. Our global health and safety goal is zero injuries and illnesses.\\nSince 2000, we have reduced our workforce lost-time incident rate by more than 80 percent. While this number is declining, safety incidents do occur. We deeply regret that two contract workers were fatally injured in separate incidents related to ExxonMobil operations in 2017. One incident occurred at an onshore drilling site and the other happened at a refinery during construction activities. We thoroughly investigated the causes and contributing factors associated with the incidents to prevent similar events in the future and to globally disseminate findings.\\nExxonMobil\\'s Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS) establishes a framework for addressing risk across all aspects of our operations. OIMS, which is built around 11 key elements of risk, is embedded into everyday work processes in each of the following areas of safety at ExxonMobil:\\nProcess safety: Process safety is about managing the integrity of our facilities by applying good design principles, engineering and operating practices. ExxonMobil incorporates rigorous safety standards and procedures in our facilities\\' design, construction and operating activities. We classify and track incidents by severity from Tier 1 through Tier 4, with Tier 1 referring to events of greater consequence. In 2017, we experienced 63 Tier 1 process safety events, which is approximately 1.6 percent lower than 2016.\\nProduct stewardship: Product stewardship refers to a series of interconnected work processes for the safe and effective management of a product, focusing on the health, safety and environmental impacts at each phase of a product\\'s lifecycle. We regularly use lifecycle assessments to consider impacts during the development, manufacturing, use and disposal of our products.\\nProduct transportation: ExxonMobil implements rigorous safety and environmental standards while transporting our products, including by marine, pipeline and rail. We carefully maintain and monitor our infrastructure worldwide to identify and prevent corrosion, third-party damage or illegal intrusions onto our rights of way.\\nEmergency preparedness and response: We establish emergency support groups and incident management teams around the world to develop and practice emergency response\\n\\nSafety, health and the workplace\\nstrategies. In 2017, we conducted 37 drills, including in Guyana where we have discovered an estimated recoverable resource of over four billion oil equivalent barrels.\\nOIMS also establishes a framework for addressing risk across our supply chain. Contractors are an integral part of the ExxonMobil team; it is essential that they conduct work in accordance with our policies and business objectives. Since 2000, we have conducted safety leadership forums with contractors working on our major projects. This promotes a strong safety partnership with contract workers to improve our safety performance and positively influence the industry.\\nThe success of ExxonMobil\\'s operations depends on a healthy and competent workforce. We have corporate-wide expectations for identifying, evaluating and managing health risks related to our operations that can potentially affect our employees, contractors or the public.\\nIn each country, we develop workplace health programs that take into consideration local health care systems, health needs and available resources.

ExxonMobil believes the risks of climate change warrant action.\\nOur climate change risk management strategy consists of four pillars: mitigating emissions in our operations, developing scalable technology solutions, providing customer solutions that reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and engaging on climate change policy.\\n\\nAbove: Sona Joseph, a research analyst, running computer models at the Upstream Research Company lab in Spring, Texas.\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\n\"Climate change is a complex issue requiring global participation and solutions. In my role, I apply my technical, operational and regulatory background to evaluate strategies and partnerships to progress new solutions, an important factor in improving our emissions performance.\"\\nSufang Zhao\\nEnvironmental policy and planning analyst, Exxon Mobil Corporation\\n16\\n\\x0cMitigating emissions from our operations\\nWe are working to increase energy efficiency and reduce flaring, venting and other emissions in our operations. We expect our greenhouse gas reduction measures to lead to a 15 percent decrease in methane emissions and a 25 percent reduction in flaring by 2020. We also expect to further improve our industry-leading efficiency in refining and chemical manufacturing facilities.\\nIn 2017, ExxonMobil and our subsidiary XTO Energy established a methane management program that exceeds applicable regulations. The program prioritizes actions at the highestvolume production and midstream sites and includes efforts to develop and deploy new, more efficient technologies to detect and reduce facility emissions.\\nAlong with several industry peers, we issued Guiding Principles, which provide a framework for continually reducing methane emissions, improving accuracy of methane emissions data and advocating sound policies and regulations.\\nOther ways we are reducing emissions include deploying proven technologies such as cogeneration and carbon capture and storage. Longer term, we are conducting and supporting research to further develop breakthrough technologies. For information on how ExxonMobil manages the business risks of climate change, including energy demand sensitivities, implications of 2 degree Celsius scenarios and positioning for a lower-carbon future, please see ExxonMobil\\'s Energy and Carbon Summary.\\nDeveloping technology solutions\\nTechnological advancements will be instrumental to meet rising global energy demand while also lowering greenhouse gas emissions. We are conducting scientific research to enhance existing and develop next-generation energy sources. ExxonMobil has spent more than $9 billion on lower-emission energy solutions since 2000.\\nAt the center of our research is ExxonMobil\\'s Corporate Strategic Research laboratory, a fundamental research institution with approximately 170 PhD scientists and engineers focused on addressing the company\\'s long-range science needs. We support a diverse portfolio of in-house research projects, including next-generation biofuels, carbon capture and storage, alternative energy and climate science. ExxonMobil is partnering with approximately 80 universities around the world to explore new energy technologies.\\n\\nManaging the risks of climate change\\n\\nGreenhouse gas emissions avoided from ExxonMobil actions*\\nNet equity, CO2-equivalent emissions Millions of metric tons\\n\\n160 140 120 100\\n80 60 40 20\\n0 2008\\n\\n2009\\n\\n2010\\n\\n2011\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\nActual\\n\\nAvoided\\n\\n*In 2017, greenhouse gas emissions avoided from ExxonMobil actions were 23.4 million metric tons. Since 2008, we have avoided 168 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions as a result of ExxonMobil actions. Our calculations are based on the guidance provided in American Petroleum Institute\\'s Compendium of Greenhouse Gas Emission Estimation Methodologies for the Oil and Gas Industry and IPIECA\\'s Petroleum Industry Guidelines for Reporting Greenhouse Gas Emissions. We report greenhouse gas emissions on a net equity basis for our business operations, demonstrating a share of emissions from any facility or operation in which ExxonMobil holds a financial interest, with the share reflecting the equity interest.\\n\\nIn carbon capture, we are conducting research to find ways to improve existing technologies. One project, with FuelCell Energy, is focused on reducing the cost of capturing carbon by using carbonate fuel cells that generate power while capturing carbon. We are identifying potential locations for pilot testing.\\nExxonMobil has extensive experience in carbon capture and has a working interest in more than one-fifth of the world\\'s total carbon capture and storage capacity. In 2017, we captured approximately 6.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide for storage.\\n\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\n17\\n\\x0cWe are also conducting extensive research on biofuels. In 2017, ExxonMobil and Synthetic Genomics, Inc. announced breakthrough research involving a modified algae strain that more than doubled its oil content without significantly inhibiting growth, a key challenge along the path to commercial scalability. We recently announced a new research phase of this project that could lead to the production of 10,000 barrels of algae biofuel per day by 2025. The new phase of research includes an outdoor field study that will grow naturally occurring algae in several ponds in California.\\nEmissions reduction\\n> $9B\\ninvested to develop loweremission energy solutions\\nsince 2000\\n\\n> $4 Billion\\ninvested since 2000 at our Upstream facilities around the world on emission reduction efforts, including energy efficiency and flare mitigation\\n\\n> $2 Billion\\ninvested since 2000 in our refining and chemical facilities and enabling research around the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions\\n\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\n> $3 Billion\\nin support of Upstream, Downstream and Chemical cogeneration facilities since 2001 to more efficiently produce electricity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions\\n\\nManaging the risks of climate change\\nProviding solutions for customers\\nIn addition to developing and deploying technologies to reduce emissions from our own operations, we are working to help our customers reduce their emissions. Our goal is to develop solutions that are economically competitive and affordable, including:\\nExpanding the supply of cleaner-burning natural gas to reduce emissions in power generation: The use of natural gas in power generation represents one of the greatest opportunities for society to reduce emissions and transition to a lower greenhouse gasintensive energy system. ExxonMobil is one of the largest natural gas producers in the world and is a leader in liquefied natural gas technology.\\nCreating lightweight plastics and other materials for a range of consumer products: ExxonMobil\\'s next-generation plastic packaging reduces total product weight and enables more products per shipment, fewer trucks on the road, less fuel and energy used, fewer greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately less material to be reused, recovered or recycled. For example, for every 10 percent drop in vehicle weight, fuel economy improves by an estimated 7 percent. We recognize plastic waste is an issue for societies, and ExxonMobil is engaged with diverse industries in helping to identify solutions.\\nDeveloping premium, high-efficiency fuels and lubricants: Our family of high-performance lubricants includes synthetic lubricants like Mobil 1TM Annual Protection that need to be replaced less frequently than conventional motor oils, therefore reducing the volume of used oil for disposal or recycling. Our lubricants and greases are also used in more than 40,000 wind turbines worldwide.\\nEngaging on climate change policy\\nClimate change is a global issue that requires the collaboration of governments, companies, consumers and other stakeholders. We engage a variety of stakeholders on climate change issues -- including policymakers, investors, consumers, nongovernmental organizations, academics and the public -- to advocate for responsible policies that would be effective in addressing the risks of climate change.\\nExxonMobil supports the Paris Agreement as an important framework for addressing the risks of climate change. We welcomed the Paris Agreement when it was announced in December 2015, and again when it came into effect in November 2016. We have reiterated our support to government officials, nongovernmental organizations and the broader public.\\n18\\n\\x0cManaging the risks of climate change\\n\\nFree markets, innovation and technology are essential in addressing the risks of climate change. Success in developing and deploying technologies will be highly dependent on governments creating a policy environment that enables innovation and competition. Policies should be clear and guard against duplicative, overlapping and conflicting regulations, which may distort markets and impose unnecessary costs on consumers. We believe an effective policy response to climate change requires a thorough understanding of the climate system. Our scientists have been involved in climate change research and related policy analysis for more than 35 years, resulting in hundreds of publicly available documents on climate-related topics, including more than 50 peer-reviewed publications.\\nWe believe that effective policies are those that:\\n Promote global participation;  Let market prices drive the selection of solutions;  Ensure a uniform and predictable cost of greenhouse gas emissions across the economy;  Minimize complexity and administrative costs;  Maximize transparency; and  Provide flexibility to react to developments in technology, climate science and policy.\\nExxonMobil is a founding member of the Climate Leadership Council. The Council was created by former U.S. Secretaries of State George P. Shultz and James A. Baker, III to advocate for a carbon tax that would implement a gradually increasing price on carbon. The revenues generated by the plan would be returned to American energy consumers. In 2018, we joined the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, a voluntary initiative representing 13 of the world\\'s largest oil and gas producers working collaboratively toward solutions to mitigate the risks of climate change.\\n\\nClimate risk oversight\\nExxonMobil\\'s board of directors is responsible for risk oversight, including the risks of climate change. The board routinely reviews and considers these risks, including briefings on public policy, scientific and technical research, as well as company and external positions and actions in this area. Climate-related matters are also considered by the board throughout the year in various other contexts, including reviews of the Outlook for Energy, the company\\'s safety, health and environmental performance, the annual corporate planning process, shareholder proposals and regulatory filings such as the 10-K.\\nSynthetic Genomics, Inc. and ExxonMobil are working together to turn algae into a low-emission transportation fuel.\\n\\nExplore more\\n2018 ExxonMobil Energy and Carbon Summary exxonmobil.com/ecsummary\\n\\nPartnering with Singapore universities to innovate lower-emission technologies\\nexxonmobil.com/singaporeuniversities\\n\\nTaking action to manage methane emissions\\nexxonmobil.com/ managemethaneemissions\\n\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\n19\\n\\x0cEnvironmental performance\\nAbove: ExxonMobil is working to help protect the Scheepmaker\\'s Crowned Pigeon, a threatened species native to Papua New Guinea. 2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\nOur diverse portfolio of projects requires us to work in remote and sensitive environments including Arctic, deepwater and biodiverse locations. ExxonMobil considers a full range of potential environmental and social risks associated with the lifecycle of our operations and products. In doing so, we gain a holistic understanding of our impacts from initial exploration activities to decommissioning.\\n\"ExxonMobil is committed to excellence in environmental performance. It takes every single one of us, every day. It\\'s simply how we work.\"\\nKylie Bishop\\nEnvironmental engineer, ExxonMobil Chemical Scotland 20\\n\\x0cManaging environmental performance\\nWe comply with all applicable regulatory requirements and, where there are none on a particular issue, we follow relevant risk-based standards that protect the environment. Our facilities are designed, operated and managed with the goal of mitigating adverse environmental impacts. Our management approach is guided by an in-depth scientific understanding of the environmental impacts of our operations and a commitment to develop, maintain and operate projects and decommission assets using appropriate standards. We work to continually improve our performance and look to new and existing technologies to enhance our operations.\\nIn 2017, we maintained strong performance across our key environmental focus areas:\\nBiodiversity\\nIn 2017, ExxonMobil contributed approximately $3 million to organizations focused on biodiversity protection and land conservation. To protect particular species and sensitive habitats, we take steps such as modifying engineering design and enhancing wildlife habitats at our properties.\\nWater management\\nOur net freshwater consumption at our operations was 300 million cubic meters in 2017. This represents about a 20 percent decline since 2011, in part due to the development and implementation of local water management strategies.\\nIn our Upstream onshore operations, water consumption is primarily associated with hydraulic fracturing, which uses water pressure to create small cracks or fissures in rocks deep underground so that oil or natural gas can flow to the well. The industry has more than 60 years of experience with the technique.\\nWe continuously work to improve our understanding of our water consumption, including when, where and how much. Using the latest version of a water tool developed by IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry association for environmental and social issues, we identified that almost 37 percent of our major operating sites are in areas with the potential for water scarcity. Therefore, we pursue site-specific management strategies such as the deployment of water conservation technologies, the use of alternative water sources, recycling of municipal and industrial wastewater, substitution with lower-quality water sources and harvesting of rainwater.\\n\\nEnvironmental management process\\n\\nEnvironmental performance\\n\\nIdentify\\nEnvironmental and social aspects\\n\\n+ Evaluate\\nEnvironmental, social and regulatory settings\\n\\nConduct\\nEnvironmental and social risk assessment\\n\\nApply\\nEnvironmental and social aspects\\n\\nMonitor & Evaluate\\n\\nManage risks Avoid, reduce, remedy\\n\\nSpill performance and prevention\\nExxonMobil is committed to the prevention and elimination of spills from our operations. We have the industry\\'s only dedicated, in-house oil spill response research program. If a spill does occur, we ensure a rapid, comprehensive response to minimize impact on communities and the environment.\\nWe reported our best-ever performance for number of spills in 2017. We had 7 percent fewer than 2016. Since 2011, ExxonMobil has reduced the absolute number of spills greater than 1 barrel by more than 55 percent across our global operations. The total volume of hydrocarbons spilled on soil and water was 6,900 barrels in 2017, and more than 65 percent was recovered at the spill sites. The majority of these spills did not affect third parties or nearby communities.\\nAir emissions\\nExxonMobil is committed to doing our part to contribute to cleaner air in the communities where we operate. Our combined emissions of volatile organic compounds, sulfur dioxide\\n\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\n21\\n\\x0cand nitrogen oxides have decreased by almost 31 percent over the past 10 years across all our businesses. New air measurement technologies are making it easier to monitor ambient air at our Downstream facilities in the United States and Canada. Data collected around the perimeter of our facilities is publicly available to local communities.\\nDecommissioning and rehabilitation\\nWe are committed to sustainably managing our surplus properties. In 2017, ExxonMobil Environmental Services monitored about 4,000 active remediation sites in more than 30 countries.\\nA significant number of our Upstream locations are located offshore. To effectively manage offshore operations, we use a systematic decommissioning process that varies depending on the type of structure and unique characteristics of a specific site. ExxonMobil created an offshore decommissioning center of expertise in 2015 that is responsible for planning and managing the safe decommissioning of our assets.\\nSeismicity\\nExxonMobil has a comprehensive risk management approach in place to limit induced seismicity from our operations by evaluating the relative risks associated with the specific geological and geographic context of a site.\\nWe work with academic and government researchers and regulatory agencies to share our knowledge and advanced approaches. For example, ExxonMobil and Stanford University jointly developed a software modeling tool to assess the potential risk of induced seismicity and made it freely available to government and industry. The tool is being used by regulatory agencies and energy companies to help reduce the risk of human-induced seismicity.\\n\\nEnvironmental performance\\nKaren Power, a production engineer, in front of ExxonMobil\\'s Hebron offshore platform off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.\\n\\nExplore more\\nProtecting the endangered western gray whale exxonmobil.com/westerngraywhale\\n\\nReducing nitrate flow to the Mississippi River\\nexxonmobil.com/nitrateflowmississippi\\n\\nDecommissioning the Sable offshore energy project\\nexxonmobil.com/sableoffshoreenergyproject\\n\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\n22\\n\\x0cCommunity engagement and human rights\\n\\nExxonMobil works in communities all over the world, each with its own unique cultures, needs and sensitivities.

We engage with local communities through a variety of communication channels -- including open houses, community discussions and individual meetings -- to provide opportunities for dialogue with interested stakeholders. ExxonMobil creates grievance reporting mechanisms that provide opportunities for local citizens and communities to raise concerns.\\nRespecting human rights\\nWe believe our business presence can and should have a positive influence on the people in the communities in which we operate. ExxonMobil is committed to respecting human rights as a fundamental principle in our operations, implemented through training and the application of our internal policies and practices. The company\\'s practices and operations reflect the spirit and intent of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\\nIn 2017, ExxonMobil\\'s supplier, vendor and contractor expectations became part of an annual letter we send to our suppliers. These expectations include references to key international human rights frameworks such as the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the International Labor Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.\\nWe participate in the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, an initiative that provides guidance to extractive companies on human rights risk assessments relating to the safeguarding of company operations or facilities. Engaging and training host government and private security on the Voluntary Principles is key to reducing human rights risks in certain communities. In 2017, more than 5,000 host government security and ExxonMobil-contracted security personnel were trained on the Voluntary Principles across 12 higher-risk countries.\\n\\nCommunity engagement and human rights\\nInvesting in our communities\\nExxonMobil collaborates with governments and other stakeholders to invest in community development programs where we operate. We work with local stakeholders to ensure that our efforts are tailored to address community and business needs, such as access to skills training and health care, support for disaster relief, education initiatives and economic development.

Our approach focuses on three key areas: employing and training a local workforce, supporting local suppliers and improving livelihoods of community members through local community investments.\\nWe provide locally hired individuals with opportunities to develop technical and leadership skills that will benefit them throughout their careers with ExxonMobil, and with future employers. With about 60 percent of our employees located outside the United States, local hiring ensures that our workforce remains culturally diverse and representative of the countries where we operate. As illustrated to the right, we continued to make progress in local hiring and training in 2017.\\nSupply chain management\\nWe work to source goods from local suppliers. In 2017, ExxonMobil made payments to more than 100,000 suppliers of goods and services worldwide.\\nWe have developed a set of best practices to help ensure our company consistently engages with local and diverse suppliers. These practices include supplier forums, local supplier databases and local enterprise centers for business development and training. For example, we have established a Centre for Local Business Development and supplier registration portal to support identification and training of Guyanese suppliers for our new development in Guyana. A similar example, in Papua New Guinea, has supported nearly 19,000 local entrepreneurs.\\nIn addition, we cultivate long-lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with diverse suppliers to contribute to the economic development of historically underrepresented groups. In 2017, we exceeded our target with a total of $1.9 billion in spending with diverse suppliers in the United States.\\nOur supplier diversity program continues to expand internationally. In 2017, we spent $186 million with women-owned and indigenous-owned businesses outside the United States. We continue to work with the nonprofit WEConnect International, a global network that connects women-owned businesses to qualified buyers, to increase the participation of women-owned businesses in our supply chain.

ExxonMobil acted swiftly to ensure the safety of our employees and support affected communities.\\n\\nSupporting our communities and our people\\nWe started our response to Hurricane Harvey before it even arrived -- by making a financial contribution to community disaster relief efforts and by beginning to safely shut down our operations and make plans to bring in fuel from unaffected locations to aid in response and recovery.\\nAt our Baytown and Beaumont refineries, we worked to minimize environmental impacts from our operations that were caused by the storm and resulting power loss, and reported impacts to appropriate authorities.\\nWe helped our employees -- many of whom spent day and night on the job to help safely shut down and then quickly restart our operations -- clean up and repair their own homes, when they were flooded by the storm.\\nIn the days and weeks following the storm, ExxonMobil contributed more than $7 million to assist with recovery efforts, and provided supplies and volunteers to assist with community recovery.\\nFor example, our employees helped the city of Beaumont restore its municipal water system, when Harvey left more than 100,000 people without running water. And we transported more\\n\\nthan 60,000 pounds of cargo via helicopter to stranded personnel and community members throughout the area. As rebuilding along the Gulf Coast continues, we are thankful for the incredible dedication of our employees and the resilience of our neighbors and the communities we serve.\\nEmergency response operations\\nThe ability to respond promptly during a disaster -- regardless of where it strikes -- is critical. ExxonMobil conducts extensive training and drills to prepare for such situations. We design our facilities to withstand a variety of extreme conditions. Regardless of the size, severity or cause of an event, each ExxonMobil facility and business unit has access to trained responders and resources. We practice emergency response strategies and routinely test our emergency response teams in accordance with regulatory requirements and our own Operations Integrity Management System.\\nAbove: Relief supplies for Hurricane Harvey victims being loaded into a helicopter by ExxonMobil employees in Texas.\\n\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\n29\\n\\x0cAbout the Sustainability Report Highlights\\nThe Highlights summarize ExxonMobil\\'s approach to managing our operations, and explains the measures we employ to operate in a variety of environments. It describes how we address the dual challenge of meeting the world\\'s demand for energy while managing the risks of climate change. For more information on ExxonMobil\\'s efforts to manage performance across our six focus areas of sustainability, visit our full online 2017 Sustainability Report. We developed this year\\'s Sustainability Report in accordance with the reporting guidelines and indicators of IPIECA (the global oil and gas industry association for environmental and social issues), the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers and the American Petroleum Institute. Note that many of the standards and metrics used in preparing this report continue to evolve and are based on management assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time of preparation, but should not be considered guarantees.\\nExxonMobil corporate responsibility recognition\\nExxonMobil was ranked in the top 50 of Corporate Responsibility Magazine\\'s Best Corporate Citizens in both 2017 and 2018 in recognition of the company\\'s commitment to corporate responsibility and sustainability. The ranking is based on publicly available records from company websites, annual reports, shareholder calls, media interviews, NGOs and government documents. The analysis includes 260 data points on environmental performance, climate change, human rights, employee relations, corporate governance, philanthropy and financial performance.\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\n2017 material issues\\nSince 2006, ExxonMobil has conducted an annual materiality assessment to identify the issues that, in the view of the company\\'s management and its external stakeholders, have the potential to significantly affect sustainability performance. For this 2017 Sustainability Report, we evaluated key metrics within the sustainability issues for our business and stakeholders using a review of IPIECA reporting guidance, feedback from external stakeholders, sessions with ExxonMobil business support representatives, a benchmark of peer company reports and a media review.\\n\\nSafety, health and the workplace\\n Emergency preparedness and response  Employee benefits and practices  Personnel and process safety  Product safety and responsibility  Product transportation safety  Workforce engagement  Workplace security  Worksite health and wellness\\nManaging the risks of climate change\\n Developing technology solutions  Engaging on climate change policy  Mitigating emissions  Providing solutions for customers\\nEnvironmental performance\\n Air emissions  Biodiversity and ecosystem services  Decommissioning and rehabilitation of\\nthe environment\\n Environmental compliance  Environmental management approach  Spill performance  Water management\\n\\nCommunity engagement and human rights\\n Community relations  External stakeholder engagement  Human rights  Indigenous peoples\\nLocal development and supply chain management\\n Local economic growth and\\ndevelopment\\n Supply chain management\\nCorporate governance\\n Board leadership  Ethics and integrity  Executive compensation and strategic\\nadvantage\\n Political advocacy and contributions  Shareholder relations  Transparency\\nBusiness operations (included throughout report)\\n Energy future and portfolio\\nmanagement\\n Management systems  Operating in sensitive environments\\n\\n30\\n\\x0cPerformance data\\nWe assess our performance at many levels of the organization, from individual operational sites to the business lines, to support continual improvement in all areas of sustainability. Starting in 2011, performance data include XTO Energy information. As part of our commitment to transparently communicate our performance, in 2014 we started reporting our data over a 10-year period to demonstrate performance trends over time. Data included in the performance table is guided by the reporting guidelines and indicators of IPIECA\\'s Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting (2015).\\n\\nFor

In such a world, the power of connectivity  keeping us in touch, informed and entertained  has never been more important.\\nAt AT&T, we\\'ve been connecting people, communities and businesses for more than 140 years, and we take that responsibility very seriously. Thanks to the resilience of our people and our networks, we\\'ve weathered many crises over the decades. And every time, we\\'ve emerged stronger than before.\\nWhether they\\'re in the field serving customers and maintaining our network, on the front lines putting their lives at risk to report breaking news, or at home remotely supporting key business operations, AT&T employees are always there for our communities and for one another  giving their all to continue providing essential services.\\nTo help ease the burden on the people who keep our company strong, we took a number of steps, including bonuses for front-line employees and managers, as well as temporary paid family leave to help all employees cover a broad range of COVIDrelated needs.

Our services help friends, families and colleagues maintain important connections even when society may be urged to stay apart.\\nFirst Responders and Our Communities For first responders, doctors, nurses and others delivering vital services during a public crisis, reliable connectivity can be a matter of life and death. This type of event is exactly why the FirstNet platform was created.\\nWhen the U.S. hospital ship Mercy docked in Los Angeles to provide temporary care, AT&T activated a 1 gigabit connection within 24 hours of the ship\\'s arrival and deployed a portable cell site nearby to increase capacity for the influx of first responders. In New York City, we helped equip hundreds of ambulances with FirstNet ReadyTM devices to enhance inter-agency communication. And because we understand that helping others around the clock can take a toll on those called to serve, AT&T supports FRONTLINEHELP.org, a free emotional wellness program for COVID-19 healthcare workers and first responders. We also committed $5.5 million to provide nourishing meals for front line workers and others in need impacted by COVID-19.\\n\\nAs the public seeks up-to-the-minute information on the pandemic and treatment efforts, millions look to AT&T for valuable news and updates. In March, CNN continued to be the #1 global news brand, reaching 362 million worldwide and 246 million in the U.S.  a record 75% of Americans, our biggest audience ever.2\\nOur Employees As the need for social distancing grew, AT&T implemented a sweeping work-fromhome policy. We authorized temporary compensation increases for employees on the front lines who can\\'t do their job from home, and implemented guidelines to help keep them safe. And we committed more than $100 million to help WarnerMedia cast and crew while on production hiatus.\\nCompany-wide, we temporarily increased available paid, excused time off to 160 total hours for quarantined employees testing positive or at higher risk for COVID-19, for parents or guardians of children whose school or daycare closed, and for primary caregivers of someone diagnosed with COVID-19 and unable to provide self-care.\\nRead more about our efforts at att.com/COVID.\\n\\nHOW WE\\'RE RESPONDING\\n\\nSMALL BUSINESS & INNOVATION As part of the Stand for Small coalition, AT&T is helping small businesses in the U.S. maintain their vital role in our communities and economy.

Broad deployment of 5G wireless technology will dramatically increase adoption of these solutions, as carriers work to deliver a faster, more responsive network experience to an immense number of users and connected devices.\\n\\nW e\\'re continuously building out our wireless and wired networks to enhance reliability, coverage, speed and overall performance for consumers and businesses. Since 2015, we\\'ve invested more than $135 billion in our networks  more than any other public company in the U.S. Through these investments, AT&T is helping lead the shift to 5G, which we expect will bring significant economic, social and environmental benefits.\\n\\nPublic Safety AT&T supports smart city initiatives throughout the country to help city planners improve safety and sustainability for citizens. With connected IoT technology, we enable solutions that help streetlights self-report outages, track air quality and even detect gunshots in the area. In San Jose, Calif., we worked with the city to place Wi-Fi extenders and smart lighting controllers in 14 parks to provide internet access, help improve public safety and reduce the city\\'s energy use.\\n\\nIoT and video intelligence enable near realtime situational awareness from the remote\\n\\nmonitoring of things such as objects, traffic and people (with privacy protection) to help improve municipal security, efficiency and safety.\\nHealthcare XENEX germ-zapping robots connected with AT&T IoT technology are using intense pulsed xenon ultraviolet light to deactivate viruses, bacteria and spores on surfaces and help hospitals avoid infections and save lives. High-speed, lower-latency 5G networks using millimeter wave spectrum (\"5G+\") can also help make telemedicine more effective by allowing clinicians to conduct virtual patient visits while downloading an entire MRI scan in seconds. And AT&T is helping VITAS Healthcare, an endoflife care provider, explore the benefits of 5G-enabled VR content to help ease pain and anxiety among terminally ill patients.\\nEducation AT&T is working to deploy 5G at Deloitte\\'s Dallas-area training center, where\\n\\ndevelopment programs plan to use augmented reality and VR-based curricula to help make education more immersive and engaging. We\\'re also working with the University of Miami to deploy 5G and Multiaccess Edge Computing on its Coral Gables campus, to help support innovative teaching and research methods.\\nAI at AT&T By combining machine learning with human expertise and experience, AT&T is using AI to fight fraudulent behavior and robocalls on our network and to improve customer service and field technician responsiveness. AI and machine learning also contribute to the ongoing development of our Climate Change Analysis Tool, which analyzes millions of data points to model climate-related scenarios that could affect our business operations for several decades.\\nRead more in our Technology Innovation issue brief at about.att.com/csr/reporting.\\n\\nAI GUIDING PRINCIPLES\\nAt AT&T, AI and machine learning are woven into our customer interactions, technology development and our planning for the future. We\\'ve adopted a set of principles that guide our decisions for using AI in our business:\\n\\nBY PEOPLE, FOR PEOPLE We incorporate human\\noversight into applications of AI. By keeping people at the core, AI can enhance\\nour workforce, expand capabilities and benefit\\nsociety as a whole.\\n\\nACCESSIBLE AND SHARED We support open-source communities whenever\\nappropriate  to further access to technology, collaboration, standardization and participation in industry discussion.\\n\\nSECURE AND ETHICAL We are grounded in ethics, safety and values at every stage of AI development and deployment, incorporating our privacy principles and\\nsecurity safeguards.\\n\\x0c2019/2020 AT&T CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUMMARY\\nPRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY\\n\\nGLOBAL CHALLENGES\\n\\nPROGRESS\\n\\nINTRODUCTION & OPPORTUNITIES\\n\\nGOVERNANCE TOWARD GOALS\\n\\nKPIs\\n\\nRECOGNITION\\n\\n15\\n\\nWe\\'re committed to the digital safety and well-being of our customers and to sharing solutions, tools and resources to help everyone adopt safer digital habits.\\n\\nO ur It Can Wait program, active in the U.S. and Mexico, has encouraged people to drive free of distractions for more than a decade. As causes for smartphone-related driving distractions have extended beyond texting to include social media, web surfing, selfies and video chatting, we\\'ve expanded our efforts to discourage all forms of smartphonedistracted driving  whether in a car or on a scooter. Through the end of 2019, more than 40 million people have taken the It Can Wait pledge to never drive distracted.\\nDigital and device safety no longer pertain just to when consumers use our products and services, but how they use them as well. We provide parents with resources to help guide their family\\'s technology use and manage digital habits. The AT&T Secure FamilyTM app helps parents restrict children\\'s mobile device use by location, time of day or type of content. Our ScreenReadySM program provides online resources for setting parental controls as well as tips on digital parenting. And our viewing platforms, including AT&T TV, DIRECTV and HBO Max, offer settings that help parents restrict unsupervised content.\\n\\nBULLYING PREVENTION\\nAs part of our commitment to digital safety and well-being, we\\'re working to help prevent bullying before it starts. Through our Cartoon Network Stop Bullying: Speak Up campaign in the U.S. and CN Buddy Network campaign in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, we\\'re inspiring kids to promote acceptance and kindness by advancing strategies to help everyone feel included.\\nTogether with our employees and non-profit collaborators, we\\'re also supporting initiatives that teach digital citizenship. As part of our AT&T Believes effort in Boston, we launched AT&T Positively DigitalSM, a program that helps teens address issues such as cyberbullying, online safety and diversity.\\n\\nCYBERSECURITY EDUCATION\\nAT&T is committed to helping protect our customers and to helping customers protect themselves online. People of all ages are at risk when it comes to online safety, but users over the age of 60 are frequent targets for cybercrime. Cyber Aware is our information hub that provides tips to stay more secure online and avoid scams and fraud. We\\'re also working with nonprofit organizations, such as The Oasis Institute and the Air Force Association, to support programs teaching cybersecurity skills to older adults.\\n\\nOur approach to product responsibility also focuses on the content we create. We have depiction policies that govern aspects of feature films such as tobacco use, particularly for content of interest to younger audiences. And in 2019, guided by consumer warnings from groups such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Medical Association and the American Lung Association, WarnerMedia discontinued advertising from tobacco and e-cigarette companies on our basic cable channels, such as TNT and TBS.\\nOur commitment to responsible, fair and accurate journalism guides our news business. Stories at CNN are thoroughly reviewed by producers and editors, and those involving particularly sensitive topics are further reviewed by a team of senior editors, standards and practices executives, and attorneys before\\n\\nbroadcast or publishing. In all cases, we hold our journalists to the highest standards of ethics, accuracy and integrity.\\nAT&T also strives to use our platforms to increase awareness of important causes. Through WarnerMedia, DIRECTV and Xandr, we donate airtime to qualifying non-profit and government organizations for public service announcements. In 2019, we introduced It\\'s OK, an initiative encouraging conversations around mental health issues. On select HBO episodes, bumpers let viewers know whether mental health issues are depicted and list resources that can facilitate conversations for those seeking help.\\nRead more in our Responsible Use of Products & Services and Media Pluralism, Ethics & Integrity issue briefs at about.att.com/csr/reporting.\\n\\x0c2019/2020 AT&T CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUMMARY\\nPRIVACY\\n\\nGLOBAL CHALLENGES\\n\\nPROGRESS\\n\\nINTRODUCTION & OPPORTUNITIES\\n\\nGOVERNANCE TOWARD GOALS\\n\\nKPIs\\n\\nRECOGNITION\\n\\n16\\n\\nData helps us create more reliable products and services, improve security and detect fraud, and provide customers with customized offers.

We publicly post privacy policies and give customers the ability to opt-in to some programs and say no to others. To help customers understand our practices, at att.com/privacy, we describe our technology and services in simple terms and provide a consolidated resource for privacy policies, rights such as those under the General Data Protection Regulation in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and a link to ask questions.\\nOur advertising unit, Xandr, optimizes media spend across TV and digital properties, for buyers and sellers. As part of our efforts to boost transparency, we offer an Online Advertising & Ad Tech Glossary to educate consumers on the advertising industry\\'s many technical terms. We ensure the data Xandr collects does not reflect names, email addresses or other information that directly identifies a user. And Xandr never sells data from our platform pertaining to any individual that we know is a minor.\\n\\nThe AT&T Chief Privacy Officer is responsible for overseeing and enforcing the company\\'s privacy principles, policies and commitments across all operating companies  regularly updating executive leadership and the AT&T Board of Directors about privacy-related topics.\\n\"We believe that industry collaboration is an important way to reach agreement on the principles that should form the foundation of consumer privacy law.\"\\nNetwork and data security are critical components for protecting customer privacy.

We provide customers with information on how to maintain privacy, safety and security in an increasingly connected world.\\nBeyond our operations, we advocate for consumer privacy protection in public policy. As a member of the Digital Due Process Coalition, AT&T joins U.S. companies, think tanks and other privacy advocates to campaign for the simplification and unification of the legal standards in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. AT&T also advocates for the adoption of U.S. federal consumer privacy legislation ensuring a unified approach to privacy, data security and breach notification that is consistent with Federal Trade Commission standards.\\n\\nWe believe that industry collaboration is an important way to reach agreement on the principles that should form the foundation of consumer privacy law. We participate in the Freedom Online Coalition\\'s Advisory Network, IAB Europe\\'s Transparency and Consent Framework and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Privacy Guidelines Expert Group. We also regularly engage with the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Future of Privacy Forum, the Information Accountability Foundation, Access Now, Red en Defensa de los Derechos Digitales, ARTICLE 19 and RightsCon.\\nRead more in our Customer Privacy and Network & Data Security issue briefs at about.att.com/csr/reporting.\\n\\x0c2019/2020 AT&T CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUMMARY\\nHUMAN RIGHTS\\n\\nGLOBAL CHALLENGES\\n\\nPROGRESS\\n\\nINTRODUCTION & OPPORTUNITIES\\n\\nGOVERNANCE TOWARD GOALS\\n\\nKPIs\\n\\nRECOGNITION\\n\\n17\\n\\nAT&T has a longstanding commitment to human rights that is embedded throughout our operations and managed by a committee of senior executives from across the business. We operate with transparency, engage with stakeholders and promote responsiveness and accountability around human rights issues.\\n\\nWe\\'re following guidance from the United Nations, including the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, as we plan future infrastructure investments. In 2020, we\\'re conducting similar internal assessments across Latin America and will use the results to optimize our business practices.\\n\\nI n 2019, we updated the AT&T Human Rights Policy by evaluating the work of our peers and identifying best practices across industries. Our approach is informed by international bodies and human rights frameworks such as the International Labour Organization, OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Last year, AT&T became the first U.S.-based telecommunications service provider to join the U.N. Global Compact to promote accountability and stakeholder dialogue in the areas of human rights, labor and the environment.\\nAT&T\\'s Human Rights policy reflects considerations for all our operating companies. For instance, WarnerMedia\\'s integration into our business reinforced our historical commitments to a free press, journalistic integrity, freedom of expression and broad accessibility of information.\\nThe AT&T Human Rights Policy also reflects our commitment to human rights due diligence. For example, a recent internal human rights assessment in Mexico informed us of sensitivities to placing cellular infrastructure on indigenous land.\\n\\n\"WarnerMedia\\'s integration into our business reinforced our historical commitments to a free press, journalistic integrity, freedom of expression and broad accessibility of information.\"\\n\\nThe size and scale of our operations allow us to be a leader in protecting human rights around the world through numerous industry collaborations. As a member of the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC), AT&T works alongside 17 global telecommunications companies to help ensure our suppliers are operating in accordance with our corporate social responsibility and human rights expectations.\\n\\nCONNECTING FAMILIES\\nWe recognize our services can play a role in promoting human rights around the world, and we developed a program in accordance with the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. The initiative supports unaccompanied migrant children fleeing violence in their home countries with free telephone calls to let family at home know they are safe.\\n\\nAT&T is also an active member of Tech Against Trafficking, a coalition of technology companies and global experts who seek to eradicate human trafficking through the use of technology. We formed an internal Online Safety Committee in 2019 to assess the risk of online child exploitation across our operating companies and to explore opportunities to include prevention efforts in our corporate responsibility initiatives. And in 2020, we are undertaking a comprehensive assessment of all business operations to ensure consistent, rigorous policies and practices are in place to protect children from exploitation.\\nRead more in our Human Rights issue brief at about.att.com/csr/reporting.\\n\\x0c2019/2020 AT&T CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUMMARY\\n\\nGLOBAL CHALLENGES\\n\\nPROGRESS\\n\\nINTRODUCTION & OPPORTUNITIES\\n\\nGOVERNANCE TOWARD GOALS\\n\\nKPIs\\n\\nRECOGNITION\\n\\n18\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n19 CSR Governance & Leadership 20 CSR Governance Council & CSR Committees 21 Stakeholder Engagement 22 Corporate Responsibility Reporting\\n\\x0c2019/2020 AT&T CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUMMARY\\n\\nGLOBAL CHALLENGES\\n\\nPROGRESS\\n\\nINTRODUCTION & OPPORTUNITIES\\n\\nGOVERNANCE TOWARD GOALS\\n\\nKPIs\\n\\nRECOGNITION\\n\\n19\\n\\nCSR GOVERNANCE & LEADERSHIP\\n\\nOur commitment to addressing environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues is embedded at every level of the company.

The Contributions Council and AT&T Foundation are comprised of senior executives charged with the supervision of our philanthropic investments.\\nMembers of the PPCRC come from diverse professional backgrounds, giving them the experience, depth of knowledge, judgment and vision needed to provide insight and guidance on policies and practices  as we work to address the breadth of ESG issues that can impact a complex enterprise like AT&T. They push us, challenge our assumptions and improve our work.\\n\\nIn addition to discussions with individual PPCRC members throughout the year, our Chief Sustainability Officer formally presents at scheduled committee meetings 3 times annually. With committee member guidance, we seek continuous improvement in areas such as climate resilience, privacy, political engagement, philanthropic giving, human rights, diversity, digital well-being and the education of our current and future workforce.\\nCSR GOVERNANCE\\n\\nAdditional Board of Directors committees oversee activities that impact ESG topics. For example, the Audit Committee reviews our cybersecurity and financial risk exposures and steps to control such risks. The Audit Committee also oversees internal controls as well as our corporate compliance program. And the Corporate Development and Finance Committee oversees capital investments and our implementation of key technology decisions.\\n\\nFoundational policies, including the codes of business conduct that govern our operating companies, put our values into action and detail our commitment to ethics, diversity, privacy, the environment and our communities.

This stakeholder engagement assessment provides insight into how AT&T should focus our resources, reporting and communications. We continuously monitor pressing and emerging ESG issues and current events, and prioritize programmatic and managerial efforts on those topics, as appropriate.\\nIn 2019, we conducted our 5th such assessment  which represents our global operations including WarnerMedia and Xandr  using a combination of electronic surveys and live interviews. Nearly 1,000 stakeholders provided insights and helped prioritize 29 ESG topics. These participants represented virtually every aspect of our business, including AT&T employees and officers across our operating companies, business and consumer customers, investors, suppliers, distributors, government and non-government organizations as well as programmatic and community organizations.\\n\\nReputation Measurement AT&T has developed an instrument to survey stakeholders and assess their perceptions of our corporate reputation and brand. On a monthly basis, the system measures AT&T\\'s overall reputation  or emotional attachment  among consumers who state they are familiar with our company\\'s operations. We\\'re able to measure interest and awareness of specific AT&T corporate responsibility programs and emerging social issues, and sample impressions of new programs under development.\\nOur measurements confirm that awareness of AT&T corporate responsibility efforts improves company reputation  which in turn positively affects key business metrics such as willingness to buy or recommend, and willingness to give AT&T the benefit of the doubt in times of difficulty.\\nLeadership Oversight The results of our ongoing stakeholder engagement efforts are reported to the CSR Governance Council and the Public Policy & Corporate Reputation Committee of the AT&T Board of Directors. The insights gained help guide our corporate responsibility strategy, improve business operations and policies, ensure transparent reporting, and prioritize programmatic investments and collaboration across the business.\\n\\nIn 2020, we plan to conduct assessments across our Latin American operations to gain additional, targeted insights that will further inform our work in those countries.\\n\\nRead more about the findings from our latest stakeholder engagement at about.att.com/ csr/reporting.\\n\\n2019 STAKEHOLDER ASSESSMENT TIER 1 PRIORITIES\\n\\nCustomer privacy\\nNetwork quality & reliability\\nTechnology innovation\\nAffordability & accessibility\\nTalent attraction, engagement & retention\\nBuilding digital skills\\n\\nNetwork data & security\\nEmployee diversity, equality & inclusion\\nEnergy efficiency & renewables\\nE-waste & product end-of-life management\\nClimate change & GHG emissions\\n\\nEnvironmental Governance/Economic\\n\\nSocial Workforce\\n\\x0c2019/2020 AT&T CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUMMARY\\n\\nGLOBAL CHALLENGES\\n\\nPROGRESS\\n\\nINTRODUCTION & OPPORTUNITIES\\n\\nGOVERNANCE TOWARD GOALS\\n\\nKPIs\\n\\nRECOGNITION\\n\\n22\\n\\nCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTING\\n\\nEach year, we highlight ESG performance and progress toward publicly stated goals through robust corporate responsibility reporting.\\nOur objective is best-in-class transparency, and we strive to present data in a modular format that is responsive to a variety of stakeholder needs and interests.

Climate change is a pressing global issue that poses an imminent threat to our planet. In 2018 alone, we experienced unprecedented heat waves, wildfires, and flooding in California, along with many other extreme weather events around the world. It\\'s clear that immediate action must be taken on a global scale if the impacts of climate change are to be mitigated and, ideally, reversed.\\nGoogle has a longstanding commitment to climate action and environmental stewardship. Sustainability has been a core value since Google\\'s founding, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. In 2018, we achieved twelve consecutive years of carbon neutrality and, for the second year in a row, matched 100% of the electricity consumption of our global operations with renewable energy. We also announced our longterm goal to power our operations with carbon-free energy, 24x7, 365 days a year.\\nWe\\'re exploring the role of artificial intelligence in helping us achieve even greater energy efficiency gains in our data centers, and we\\'re prioritizing the use of healthy materials with safe chemistry across Google\\'s built spaces. Beyond Google\\'s operations, we\\'re expanding access to the benefits of technology through energy-saving initiatives like the Nest Power Project. We\\'re also working closely with partners to develop tools for policymakers, planners, and researchers that will enable better-informed decisions and actions, like the Environmental Insights Explorer, which provides city-level carbon emissions data.\\nIn the years to come, we\\'ll focus on how Google can accelerate the transition toward carbon-free energy and a circular economy, empower everyone with technology that enables sustainable action, and benefit the communities where we operate.\\nGoogle remains steadfast in its commitment to sustainability, and we will continue to look for collaborative partnerships and innovative opportunities to help create a clean and healthy planet for everyone.\\n\\nRuth Porat\\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nUrs Hlzle\\nSenior Vice President of Technical Infrastructure\\n\\n2\\n\\x0cAbout Google\\nAs our founders explained in their first letter to shareholders, Google\\'s goal is to \"develop services that significantly improve the lives of as many people as possible.\"1 We believe in technology\\'s potential to have a positive impact on the world. We also believe we\\'re just scratching the surface. Our vision is to remain a place of incredible creativity and innovation that uses our technical expertise to tackle big problems.\\nWe generate revenues primarily by delivering both performance advertising and brand advertising. Google\\'s core products--Android, Chrome, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube--each have more than 1 billion monthly active users.\\nWe also offer a broad collection of cloud-based products and services, including G Suite business productivity apps like Docs, Drive, and Calendar and satellite mapping and analysis platforms like Google Earth and Google Earth Engine. In recent years we\\'ve expanded into consumer electronics with products including Chromecast, Google Home, Google Nest Hub, Google Pixel, and Google Pixelbook.\\nWe\\'re a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., which had $136.8 billion in total revenues in 2018 and 98,771 full-time employees as of December 31, 2018.2\\nGoogle\\'s global headquarters are located in Mountain View, California, United States. We also have significant operations in Sunnyvale as well as operations in other cities throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, including San Francisco, San Bruno, and Palo Alto. In this report the term \"Bay Area headquarters\" refers to our operations in both Mountain View and Sunnyvale. We own and lease office and building space, as well as research and development sites, across more than 150 cities, primarily in North America, Europe, South America, and Asia, and we own and operate 15 data centers across four continents.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\n3\\n\\x0cGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nAbout this report\\nThe annual data in this report covers our 2018 fiscal year (January 1 to December 31, 2018).

Fulfilling this mission, and bringing the benefits of information not just to the more than 3 billion people who are already online but to the next 4 billion, requires us to use resources ever more efficiently.3\\nThe path to a cleaner, healthier future begins with the small decisions we make each day. That\\'s why we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. We\\'re raising the bar in making smart use of Earth\\'s resources, expecting the highest ethical standards throughout our supply chain, and creating products with people and the planet in mind. We\\'re also constantly looking for ways to have a positive environmental impact and be even more responsible in our use of energy, water, and other natural resources--and we want to help others to do the same.\\nThis ambition is reflected across our value chain. Our data centers lead the industry in energy efficiency--they\\'re twice as efficient as the industry average for enterprise data centers. We\\'ve been carbon neutral since 2007, and now for the second year in a row, we\\'ve matched 100% of the electricity our operations use with renewables. This same ethos carries over to our workplaces, with over 1.2 million square meters (13 million square feet) of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified offices, and to our products. Whether\\n\\nOur approach\\n\\n6\\n\\x0cBy the end of 2018, Nest thermostats had helped customers cumulatively save more than\\n29billion\\nkWh of energy.\\n\\nsomeone is using Google at home or as part of an organization running Google Cloud or G Suite, all of the products in our Cloud are carbon neutral. As we continue to grow, we\\'re on a journey to make our Made by Google consumer electronics products work for people and the planet.\\nOur tools are built to help everyone reduce their environmental impact, understand the planet, and take sustainable action. By mapping the world\\'s forests and fisheries, our technology is making it easier for policymakers, researchers, and nonprofits to monitor the pulse of the planet. We\\'re also making it easier for everyone to take sustainable action by providing more than 1 billion kilometers (km) (621 million miles) of alternative transit options through Google Maps every day and by helping people reduce their home energy consumption with Nest thermostats, which have helped customers cumulatively save more than 29 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy.\\nAddressing a global challenge\\nHumanity is consuming natural resources at an astonishing rate. During the 20th century, global raw material use rose at about twice the rate of population growth.4 Every year humanity consumes far more than what the planet can naturally replenish. In 2018, global demand for resources was 1.7 times what the Earth\\'s ecosystems can regenerate in a year.5\\nThese statistics highlight the need to rethink the \"take-make-waste\" economic model that human societies have followed since the Industrial Revolution, in which we take a natural resource, make a product from it or burn it for fuel, and eventually send what remains to the landfill as waste. The consequences of this model have created some of the most significant challenges of our time, including climate change, extreme weather events, and plastic pollution, among others.\\nClimate change is one of the most significant global challenges of our time, and continued greenhouse gas emissions pose an existential threat to humanity. The science behind this is clear, and recent reports have stressed the urgency of the issue. In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a special report addressing the need for rapid transition and widespread action in the next 12 years if we are to limit global warming to the 1.5 degree Celsius warming scenario.6 Given this pressing time horizon, it\\'s now more important than ever for governments, businesses, and individuals around the world to take immediate and ambitious action on climate at a global scale. We believe that Google\\'s scale, resources, and technological expertise can help the world meet its energy and resource needs in a responsible way that drives innovation and growth.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nOur approach\\n\\n7\\n\\x0cGoogle\\'s data center in Eemshaven, Netherlands\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nTaking action\\nWith millions more people coming online every month, the demand for computing power continues to skyrocket and data center capacity continues to expand to meet this need. But despite this growth, the total amount of electricity used by U.S. data centers has remained constant. Annual consumption increased by 90% from 2000 to 2005, but only by 4% from 2010 to 2014, largely due to data centers\\' ability to improve their efficiency as they scale.7 As the use of mobile devices increases and more IT users transition to public clouds, we believe our industry can and must do better than just holding the line on energy use. We can actually lower it, serving more users while using fewer resources.\\nGoogle\\'s energy consumption drives our biggest impact on the environment. Internally, we\\'re focused on tackling it through a threefold strategy for carbon neutrality. Beyond Google, we\\'ve long been a vocal advocate for greening electrical grids worldwide. We support strong cleanenergy and climate-change policies committed to adding clean power to the grid, and we\\'re partnering with governments and nongovernmental organizations to use Google technology to model the effects of climate change on both a global and a local level.\\n\\nOur approach\\n\\n8\\n\\x0cOur sustainability goals, like committing to match the electricity use for our operations with 100% renewable energy, not only are good for the environment but also make good business sense. By purchasing electricity from renewable sources like wind and solar, we can set a long-term fixed price for power. This allows us to gain access to an increasingly costcompetitive source of electricity, and it helps us save money in the long run. By the end of 2018, we had contracts to purchase more than 3.75 gigawatts (GW) of output from renewable energy projects. These contracts have led to nearly $5 billion in new capital investment in projects around the world.8\\nWe\\'re also working to incorporate a climate-resilience strategy into our operations that will enable our business and the communities we\\'re part of to thrive despite the effects of climate change. The key principles that serve as the foundation for our strategy are focused on a people-centric framework that\\'s robust, integrated, diverse, and designed with unique locations, scalability, and longevity in mind.9 This framework was used to conduct a climate exposure and vulnerability analysis that enabled us to assess the future resilience of our current locations and evaluate the climate resilience of new developments. Beyond our operations, Google\\'s AI for Social Good program and Crisis Response platforms are using our technology to enhance flood forecasting models that provide predictions to inform individuals in affected areas so that they can better prepare and stay safe.\\n\\nCharleston Retention Basin on the edge of Google\\'s campus in Mountain View, California\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nOur approach\\n\\n9\\n\\x0cOur goal is to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains and enable others to do the same.\\n\\nWater is another top priority. The United Nations predicts that by 2025, two-thirds of the world\\'s population could live in water-stressed conditions, and with the existing climate change scenario, almost half the world\\'s population will be living in areas of high water stress by 2030.10 As a global company headquartered in drought-prone California, we\\'ve established a set of water principles to guide our approach to water use and ensure business continuity, especially in the places where we have the greatest potential risk. Under these principles, we\\'re working to utilize water efficiently, exploring ways to incorporate circularity, and engaging in partnerships that use Google technology to raise awareness of water-related risks and opportunities and to create platforms that help everyone study and understand global water challenges. Examples of sustainable water management practices can be seen in our data centers, where we keep working to find innovative cooling options where possible, like the use of seawater in Finland, industrial canal water in Belgium, and air cooling in Ireland. Through Google.org, we\\'ve awarded millions of dollars in grants to promising water-conservation solutions.11\\nWe see the circular economy as a complex yet inspiring information challenge that, once unlocked, will lead to a world of abundance where human, environmental, and economic systems can thrive. That\\'s why we\\'re leveraging our scale, resources, technological expertise, and close partnerships with organizations like the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, as well as with other leading companies, to accelerate the transition to a circular economy and help the world meet its resource needs.\\nUltimately, our goal is to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains and enable others to do the same. We\\'re applying our circular economy principles to design out waste, keep products and materials in use, and promote healthy materials and safe chemistry. We strive to embed these principles across our infrastructure, operations, and products, from how we manage servers in our data centers to how we design our consumer electronics to the materials we select to build and furnish our offices. As we work toward this goal, we\\'ll continue exploring the role of technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in accelerating our transition to becoming a circular Google that contributes to a sustainable world.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nOur approach\\n\\n10\\n\\x0cFigure 1\\nGOOGLE VALUE CHAIN\\nEnergy\\n\\nSetting our priorities\\nGoogle uses energy, natural resources, and products and services from our suppliers to build our workplaces, data centers, networking infrastructure, and consumer electronics. The software products and services that our customers and users rely on are powered by our data centers and networking infrastructure (see Figure 1). We\\'re driving positive environmental impact throughout our value chain in five key ways: by designing efficient data centers, advancing carbon-free energy, creating sustainable workplaces, building better devices and services, and empowering users with technology.\\nIn 2018, we undertook an assessment to identify and prioritize content for our environmental report that considered Google\\'s impact on sustainability, the importance of environmental sustainability issues to our business strategy, and the perspectives of a diverse range of stakeholders outside of Google. The issue areas that were found to be of greatest relevance include our data centers, workplaces, users, water stewardship, circular economy strategy, and supply chain. Cutting across these priorities is the importance of engaging in public policy--at local, state, federal, and international levels-- to support the success of sustainable business models.\\nAs per recommendations from the Financial Stability Board\\'s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, we have reported our exposure to climate-related risks over multiple time horizons in Alphabet\\'s 2019 CDP Climate Change Report.\\n\\nOffices and Research/Development Sites\\n\\nConsumer Electronics and Services\\n\\nNatural Resources\\n\\nManufacturing, Construction, and\\nServices\\n\\nData Centers and Networking Infrastructure\\n\\nGoogle Cloud Platform, G Suite Products, and Tools\\n\\nSuppliers and Communities\\n\\nEmployees and Communities Ecosystems\\n\\nCustomers and Users\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nOur approach\\n\\n11\\n\\x0cLooking toward future opportunities\\nWe believe global businesses like Google should lead the way in improving people\\'s lives, while reducing or even eliminating our dependence on raw materials and fossil fuels. And we believe this can be done in a way that makes business sense, providing economic returns alongside societal benefits and positive environmental impacts.\\nPlanning for the future, we\\'ve established a five-year strategy that will enable us to continue building sustainability into everything we do (see Figure 2). Our strategy focuses on three key pillars: to accelerate the transition to carbon-free energy and a circular economy, to empower users with technology, and to benefit the people and places where we operate. We\\'re continuing to work to decouple our business growth from the growth of material use and carbon intensity. This includes enhancing our net positive impact through initiatives that help our users reduce carbon emissions, save energy, and use resources more sustainably. We also want to ensure that Google products, tools, and platforms inform or enable sustainability, and that we\\'re implementing practices to add value to our communities within and outside of Google.\\nCreating Google tools that help people measure the planet\\'s health and take action is a key part of our long-term strategy. Applications of machine learning (ML) and AI are increasingly enabling not only Google but also scientists and practitioners to create sustainable solutions and to turn data into insights and knowledge needed to guide better decision-making. We\\'re excited to continue exploring how these technologies and applications can be used to create a more sustainable future for generations to come--and we\\'re committed to using these technologies in a responsible way.12\\nFigure 2\\nFIVE-YEAR SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY OVERVIEW\\nWe strive to build sustainability into everything we do\\n\\nAccelerate carbon-free and circular\\nDecouple business growth from growth of carbon\\nintensity and material use\\n\\nEmpower with technology\\nGoogle products, tools, and platforms inform or enable sustainability\\n\\nBenefit people and places\\nShare benefits with communities where we operate\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nOur approach\\n\\n12\\n\\x0cPerformance highlights and targets\\nThe following section includes highlights of the environmental initiatives discussed in this report.

We own and operate 15 data centers13 on four continents and continue to add new sites to better serve our customers. Each data center is a large campus where the vast majority of our facilities, servers, networking equipment, and cooling systems are designed from the ground up for maximum efficiency and minimal environmental impact.\\nFor more than a decade, we\\'ve worked to make Google data centers some of the most efficient in the world, improving their environmental performance even as demand for our products has dramatically risen. We\\'ve done this by designing, building, and operating each one to maximize efficient use of energy, water, and materials.\\nTo reduce energy use, we strive to build the world\\'s most energy-efficient computing network by squeezing more out of every watt of power we consume. First, we outfit each data center with high-performance servers that we\\'ve custom designed to use as little energy as possible. We improve facility energy use by installing smart temperature and lighting controls and redesigning how power is distributed to reduce energy loss. We employ advanced cooling techniques, relying primarily on energy-efficient evaporative cooling, and use nonpotable water at some sites. Finally, we\\'re applying machine learning to drive energy efficiency even further.\\nOur efforts have paid off: On average, a Google data center is twice as energy efficient as a typical enterprise data center.15 Compared with five years ago, we now deliver around seven times as much computing power with the same amount of electrical power. Much of this improvement has come from new innovations with accelerators, such as our Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)--highly efficient computer chips we designed specifically for machine learning applications.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nDesigning efficient data centers\\n\\n19\\n\\x0cIn 2018, the average annual power usage effectiveness (PUE)16 for our global fleet of data centers was 1.11, compared with the industry average of 1.6717-- meaning that Google data centers use about six times less overhead energy (11%) for every unit of IT equipment energy (see Figure 3). We aim to maintain or improve our quarterly PUE at each Google data center, year over year. Our fleet-wide PUE has stayed at or below 1.12 since 2013 (see Figure 4).\\nGenerating electricity requires water, so the less energy we use to power our data centers, the less water we use as well. The source of energy matters too: Wind and solar energy require considerably less water to produce than do coal and nuclear energy. In 2018, matching our data center electricity consumption with renewable energy reduced embedded water use by 88% on average compared with buying grid power.\\n\\nFigure 3\\nOVERHEAD ENERGY USE IN GOOGLE DATA CENTERS l Overhead energy as % of IT energy\\n-- 20\\n\\n-- 15\\n\\n11%\\n\\n-- 10\\n\\n0\\n\\n2008\\n\\n2009\\n\\n2010\\n\\n2011\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2018\\n\\nPUE PERCENT\\n\\nFigure 4\\nAVERAGE PUE FOR ALL DATA CENTERS Quarterly PUE Trailing 12-month (TTM) PUE\\n1.26 --\\n\\n1.22 --\\n\\n1.18 --\\n\\n1.14 --\\n\\n1.10 --\\n\\n2009\\n\\n2010\\n\\n2011\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2018\\n\\n1.11 1.11\\n2019\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nDesigning efficient data centers\\n\\n20\\n\\x0cGoogle\\'s data center in Saint-Ghislain, Belgium\\nIn 2013, we became the first company in North America--and the only major internet company--to achieve a multi-site energy management system certification to ISO 50001, a voluntary third-party standard. Our energy management system intends to cover all of our owned data centers globally once they meet certain operational milestones. In 2018, we maintained ISO 50001 certification for 12 of our 15 Google-owned and -operated data centers, which together represented 91% of our IT energy use.18\\nWe\\'re also working to design out waste, embedding circular economy principles into our server management by reusing materials multiple times. In 2018, 19% of components used for machine upgrades were refurbished inventory. When we can\\'t find a new use for our equipment, we completely erase any components that stored data and then resell them. In 2018, we resold nearly 3.5 million units into the secondary market for reuse by other organizations.\\nWe\\'re committed to achieving Zero Waste to Landfill19 for our global data center operations by reducing the amount of waste we generate and finding better disposal options. In 2018, we diverted 87% of waste from our global data center operations away from landfills.\\nIn addition to driving efficiency in our data center operations, we also consider supply chain impacts. Through the efforts of our Responsible Supply Chain program, we collaborate with stakeholders across our supply chain to uphold our high standards for protecting workers and the environment.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nDesigning efficient data centers\\n\\n21\\n\\x0cFrom 2007 to 2017, Google\\'s data center investments in Europe supported economic activity with\\n490\\nmillion per year in GDP.\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nOur Supplier Code of Conduct builds upon Google\\'s core values and beliefs and incorporates key elements from the Google Code of Conduct and international human rights, safety, and environmental standards.\\nGoogle has saved more than $1 billion through our energy-efficiency initiatives and hundreds of millions more through resource efficiency. By sharing our best practices and supporting research and collaboration, we hope to help other companies realize their own savings and promote ever-greater data center sustainability worldwide.\\nGoogle\\'s investment in digital infrastructure, such as data centers, also supports sustainable growth and creates economic opportunity. In 2016, Google\\'s U.S. data centers generated $1.3 billion in economic activity, $750 million in labor income, and 11,000 jobs.20 From 2007 to 2017, Google\\'s data center investments in Europe supported economic activity with 490 million per year in gross domestic product (GDP) and 6,600 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs per year, on average.21\\nCarbon-neutral cloud services\\nGoogle Cloud Platform and G Suite products like Gmail, Docs, and Drive are enabling millions of businesses to shift computing needs from self-managed data centers or colocation facilities to Google Cloud\\'s highly efficient, renewable energybased computing infrastructure. Businesses that switch to cloud-based products like G Suite have reported reductions in IT energy use and carbon emissions up to 87%,22 and a business using Gmail can reduce the GHG emissions impact of its email service by up to 98%, compared with running email via onpremises servers.23 Individual users also benefit, since providing an active user one month of Google services creates fewer GHG emissions than driving a car one mile.24 Whether someone is using Google at home or as part of an organization running Google Cloud or G Suite, all of the products in our Cloud are carbon neutral.\\nLEARN MORE 2016 case study: Circular Economy at Work in Google Data Centers 2018 spotlight: Once Is Never Enough 2018 spotlight: Putting Down Local Roots Where Google\\'s European Data Centers Are Growing 2018 spotlight: Belgian site becomes first Google data center to add on-site solar 2018 blog: Engineered for renewal: Google Cloud, Etsy and sustainability 2018 report: European Data Centers: Economic Impact and Community Benefit 2018 report: U.S. Data Centers: Economic Impact and Community Benefit Website: Google Data Centers: Efficiency: How We Do It Website: Google Cloud Sustainability Website: Google Cloud Renewable Energy Website: Responsible Supply Chain\\n\\nDesigning efficient data centers\\n\\n22\\n\\x0cSpotlight\\nAutomated AI takes Google data center efficiency to next level\\nIn 2016, we jointly developed an AI-powered recommendation system to improve the energy efficiency of Google\\'s already highly-optimized data centers. Now we\\'re taking this system to the next level: instead of humanimplemented recommendations, our AI system is directly controlling data center cooling, while remaining under the expert supervision of our data center operators. This first-of-its-kind cloud-based control system is now safely delivering energy savings in multiple Google data centers.\\nWhereas our original recommendation system had operators vetting and implementing actions, our new AI control system directly implements the actions. We\\'ve purposefully constrained the system\\'s optimization boundaries to a narrower operating regime to prioritize safety and reliability, meaning there is a risk/reward trade off in terms of energy reductions.\\nDespite being in place for only a matter of months, the system is already delivering consistent energy savings of around 30 percent on average, with further expected improvements. That\\'s because these systems get better over time with more data. Our direct AI control system is finding yet more novel ways to manage cooling that have surprised even the data center operators. Dan Fuenffinger, one of Google\\'s data center operators who has worked extensively alongside the system, remarked: \"It was amazing to see the AI learn to take advantage of winter conditions and produce colder than normal water, which reduces the energy required for cooling within the data center. Rules don\\'t get better over time, but AI does.\"\\nWe\\'re excited that our direct AI control system is operating safely and dependably, while consistently delivering energy savings. However, data centers are just the beginning. In the long term, we think there\\'s potential to apply this technology in other industrial settings, and help tackle climate change on an even grander scale.

And combating climate change requires the world to transition to a clean energy economy. So we\\'ve made it a top priority to become more energy efficient and to match every unit of energy we consume at our facilities around the world with an equivalent unit of energy from renewable sources, such as wind and solar. Our support for clean energy goes hand in hand with reducing our carbon footprint. By improving the efficiency of our operations and buying both renewable power and high-quality carbon offsets, we\\'ve been carbon neutral since 2007.\\nGoogle is the world\\'s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy.25 Since 2010, we\\'ve signed 34 agreements to purchase a total of more than 3.75 GW of renewable energy that is new to the grid (see Figure 5).26 On July 27, 2015, as part of the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, Google committed to tripling our purchases of renewable energy from 1.1 GW to 3.4 GW by 2025. We surpassed this in 2018, exceeding our target seven years early.\\nIn 2012, we set a long-term goal to purchase enough renewable energy to match all the electricity we consume globally on an annual basis. In 2017, we achieved it for the first time: Google\\'s total purchase of energy from sources like wind and solar matched the amount of electricity used by our operations around the world, including our offices and data centers. And in 2018, we again matched 100% of our annual electricity consumption with purchases of renewable energy (see Figure 6). This amounted to more than 10 million megawatt-hours (MWh) of energy--more electricity than is used annually by the state of Hawaii.27 To date, we\\'ve purchased a total of nearly 26 million MWh of renewable energy.\\nWe\\'re the first company of our size to achieve 100% renewable energy two years running.28 While we\\'re still drawing power from the grid, some of which is from fossil fuel resources, we\\'re purchasing enough renewable energy to match every MWh of electricity our data center and office operations consume.\\nOur long-term goal is to source carbon-free energy to match our electricity consumption in all places, at all times. This means realizing a future where each Google facility is always matched--around the clock--with local carbon-free power. Our ultimate vision is to create a world where everyone has access to clean energy; this includes not only Google, but our suppliers and their communities.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\\n\\n25\\n\\x0cMidAmerican Energy Wind VIII 407 MW\\nStory County II 114 MW\\nCimarron Bend 200 MW\\n\\nGolden Hills 43 MW\\nBluestem 198 MW\\n\\n400 MW 200 MW 100 MW\\n\\nBethel 225 MW\\n\\nDakota Range 300 MW\\nCoyote Ridge 98 MW\\nTatanka 98 MW\\nGlaciers Edge 200 MW\\nDuke Rider 75 MW\\nCanadian Hills 48 MW\\n\\nMaevaara l Maevaara ll\\n\\n72 MW\\n\\n33 MW\\n\\nTellenes\\n\\nLehtirova 103 MW\\nJenasen 76 MW\\n\\nKuuronkallio 60 MW\\nHedet 81 MW\\n\\n160 MW\\nWindpark Krammer 26 MW\\n\\nBeaufort 76 MW\\nEolus 62 MW\\n\\nLakiakangas 50 MW\\n\\nBouwdokken 9 MW\\n\\nDelfzijl 63 MW\\n\\nSunport 31 MW\\n\\nYum Yum 147 MW\\n\\nBellefonte 150 MW\\nRed Dirt\\n\\nGreat Western Minco ll 139 MW Georgia Power C&I\\n\\n225 MW\\n\\n101 MW\\n\\n79 MW\\n\\nWind\\n\\nSolar\\n\\nTaiyen 10 MW\\n\\nEl Romero 80 MW\\n\\nFrom 2010 to 2018, Google signed 34 agreements to purchase more than 3.75 GW of renewable energy that is new to the grid.\\n\\nFigure 5\\nRENEWABLE ENERGY FOR GOOGLE\\'S OPERATIONS\\n\\nReaching 100% renewable energy\\nWe achieved our 100% renewable energy target much faster and at much greater scale than we thought possible when we set this goal seven years ago. We met it primarily by buying renewable electricity directly from new wind and solar farms via long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) on the grids where we have operations, as well as by buying renewable power through utilities via renewable energy purchasing models that we helped create. In addition, a portion of our utility energy purchases include renewable sources as part of the utility\\'s grid mix.29 With our PPAs, we\\'re purchasing physical renewable energy, which includes the electrons bundled with renewable energy certificates (RECs).\\nBy pioneering new energy purchasing models that others can follow, we\\'ve helped drive wide-scale adoption of clean energy. For example, we joined forces with Walmart, Target, and Johnson & Johnson in Georgia to help build a state-approved program that allows companies to buy renewable energy directly through the state\\'s largest utility. The program is the first of its kind in Georgia and has paved the way for construction of two solar energy projects with a total capacity of 177 megawatts (MW).\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\\n\\n26\\n\\x0cGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nAlso in the Southeast region of the United States, we worked with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to sign a utility-based agreement where Google will purchase the output of several new solar farms, totaling 413 MW of power from 1.6 million solar panels-- equivalent to the combined size of 65,000 home rooftop solar systems. Thanks to the abundant solar power generated by these new farms, electricity consumed by our new data centers under construction in Tennessee and Alabama will be matched with 100% renewable energy from day one.\\nOur efforts to expand carbon-free energy in 2018 also took us to Europe, where we announced agreements in Finland to purchase additional renewable electricity from three new wind farms totaling 190 MW--our first such deals in the country.\\nOur renewable energy initiatives earned Google two 2018 Green Power Leadership Awards: one in International Market Development from the Center for Resource Solutions and one in Excellence in Green Power Use from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\\nDeepMind and Google recently started using machine learning (ML) to make wind power more predictable and valuable. We used ML to optimize 700 MW of wind power capacity in the Central United States that is part of our global fleet of renewable energy projects. By predicting wind power output 36 hours ahead of actual generation, our model recommends how\\nFigure 6\\nRENEWABLE ENERGY PURCHASING COMPARED WITH TOTAL ELECTRICITY USE\\nTotal electricity consumption (TWh) Renewable energy %\\n-- 10 100%\\n-- 8 100%\\n-- 6\\n\\nELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION (TWh)\\n\\n-- 4\\n\\n61%\\n\\n48%\\n\\n-- 2\\n\\n37% 34% 35%\\n0 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\\n\\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\\n\\n27\\n\\x0cMinco II wind farm in Oklahoma (101 MW for Google)\\n\\nto make optimal hourly delivery commitments to the power grid a full day in advance. This is important because energy sources that can be scheduled (i.e., can deliver a set amount of electricity at a set time) are often more valuable to the grid. To date, ML has boosted the value of our wind energy by roughly 20%, compared to the baseline scenario of no time-based commitments to the grid.\\nWe\\'re also helping to green the power grid through our advocacy of clean energy policies and our support for renewable energy procurement programs. For example, we worked with business and government stakeholders in Taiwan to share our experience with the benefits of corporate renewable energy purchasing and to support the creation of new purchasing channels for companies. We were pleased to see that Taiwan passed a law in January 2017 to allow end-users to directly purchase renewable energy for their operations. In 2018, we signed our inaugural renewable energy deal in Asia, the first such corporate power purchase agreement in Taiwan. We will purchase the output of a 10 MW solar array (which is part of a larger solar farm) in Tainan City, Taiwan. It will deploy 40,000 solar panels across commercial fishing ponds, maximizing land-use efficiency and benefiting local aquaculture workers. This will boost the carbon-free profile of our local data center.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\\n\\n28\\n\\x0cTo date, Google\\'s renewable energy purchasing contracts have led to nearly\\n$5 billion\\nin new capital investment in renewable energy projects around the world.\\n\\nAlong with being the world\\'s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy, Google is also one of the world\\'s largest corporate investors in renewable energy. Since 2010, we\\'ve committed to invest nearly $2.5 billion in large-scale renewable energy projects and residential solar rooftop funds with a total combined capacity of 3.7 GW.30 These targeted investments go beyond our own operational footprint, enabling renewable energy deployment at a larger scale while generating attractive risk-adjusted returns.\\nThe cost of renewable power has dropped precipitously, while its scale has grown dramatically. Since 2009, levelized costs for utility-scale wind and solar energy have decreased by 69% and 88%, respectively.31 In 2015, wind and solar energy became the world\\'s largest source of newly installed power capacity,32 and in 2018, 65% of net new power capacity globally came from renewable energy.33 Renewables have become a mainstream source of affordable electricity for millions of people.\\nIncreasing the share of renewables on the grid will produce many positive impacts. For example, doubling renewables by 2030 is expected to increase global GDP by as much as 1.1%, improve global welfare by 3.7%, and employ more than 24 million people in the renewable energy sector.34 To date, Google\\'s renewable energy purchasing contracts have led to nearly $5 billion in new capital investment in renewable energy projects around the world.35 At Google, we\\'ll continue doing our best to help accelerate the transition to clean energy and a more prosperous future.\\nLEARN MORE 2016 white paper: Achieving Our 100% Renewable Energy Purchasing Goal and Going Beyond 2016 spotlight: Greening the Grid: How Google Buys Renewable Energy 2018 blog post: Meeting Our Match: Buying 100 Percent Renewable Energy 2018 spotlight: Unlocking Access to Corporate Renewable Energy Purchasing in Taiwan 2018 blog post: A new partnership to drive renewable energy growth in the U.S. 2018 blog post: New wind in Finland: Scaling renewable energy as we grow 2018 blog post: The Internet is 24x7.

Our report received an A score from CDP for the past five years, and for the past four years, we earned a spot on CDP\\'s Climate A List, which recognizes top reporting companies.\\nIn 2018, our gross Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions were 4.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), but because of our renewable energy purchases, our net GHG emissions were reduced by 3.7 million tons to 750 thousand tCO2e (see Figures 7 and 8). Due to growth in our business, our operational emissions increased 30% over the past year.36 After accounting for our carbon offset purchases, our net operational carbon emissions were zero.\\nSince 2011, our renewable energy purchasing has resulted in emissions savings of nearly 11 million tCO2e--a cumulative 52% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions over this period (see Figure 9). This is equivalent to taking nearly 2.3 million cars off the road for a year, or the carbon sequestered by more than 12.5 million acres of U.S. forests in a year.37 In 2018, our operational GHG emissions were 83% lower due to our renewable energy procurement (see Figure 9).\\n\\nFigure 7\\n\\nFigure 8\\n\\nGHG EMISSIONS WITHOUT RENEWABLE\\n\\nGHG EMISSIONS WITH RENEWABLE\\n\\nENERGY PURCHASES\\n\\nENERGY PURCHASES\\n\\n-- 6\\n\\n4.9\\n-- 4\\n\\nMILLION tCO2e\\n\\n-- 2\\n1.2\\n\\n0\\n\\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\\n\\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\\n\\nScope 1 Scope 2 (location) Scope 2 (market) Scope 3 (business travel and commuting)38 Total location-based GHG emissions Total market-based GHG emissions\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\\n\\n30\\n\\x0cMILLION tCO2e\\n\\nFigure 9\\nIMPACT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY PURCHASES ON GHG EMISSIONS\\nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (without renewable energy) Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (with renewable energy)\\n\\n5 -- 4 -- 3 --\\n2 -- 1 -- 0\\n2011\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n4.4\\n0.75\\n2018\\n\\nFigure 10\\nCARBON INTENSITY PER UNIT OF REVENUE\\nCarbon intensity Total revenues\\n\\n40 -- 35 -- 30 -- 25 -- 20 -- 15 -- 10 -- 0\\n2011\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2016\\n\\n136.8 -- 150\\n\\n-- 120\\n\\n-- 90\\n\\n-- 60\\n\\n5.5\\n\\n2017\\n\\n30 2018\\n\\nBILLION US$\\n\\ntCO2e /BILLION US$\\n\\nFigure 11\\nCARBON INTENSITY PER FTE EMPLOYEE\\n\\nCarbon intensity Average number of FTE employees 60 --\\n\\n50 --\\n\\n40 -- 30 --\\n\\n20 -- 10 --\\n\\n0 2011\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2015\\n\\ntCO2e /FTE\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n-- 100\\n89.5\\n-- 80\\n-- 60\\n-- 40\\n8.4\\n20 2018\\n31\\n\\nTHOUSAND FTEs\\n\\x0cDelfzijl wind farm in the Netherlands (63 MW for Google)\\n\\nTo align with industry best practices for Scope 3 reporting, in 2018, we extended our boundaries to include manufacturing emissions beyond Tier 1 suppliers (full upstream to the point of extraction), use of sold products, end-of-life treatment of sold products, and emissions associated with food from our corporate offices. We continue to improve the level of certainty we have in calculating our Scope 3 emissions and to work to reduce them. For example, our vision is for all our suppliers\\' sites to source 100% renewable energy in every region where our products are made.\\nBecause of our emissions-reduction efforts, our carbon intensity has steadily decreased even as our company has grown and our energy use has correspondingly increased. Since 2011, our carbon intensity per unit of revenue decreased by 86% (see Figure 10), our carbon intensity39 per FTE employee decreased by 84% (see Figure 11), and our carbon intensity for electricity used at our data centers dropped by 91%. This means we\\'re delivering our products and services with reduced carbon impacts, even before using carbon offsets to reach neutrality.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\\n\\n32\\n\\x0cWells capture methane gas at Oneida-Herkimer Regional Landfill in New York.\\nTwelve years of carbon neutrality\\nIn 2007, Google committed to being carbon neutral, and we\\'ve met this goal every year since then. We reach carbon neutrality via three steps. First, we work to reduce our total energy consumption by pursuing aggressive energyefficiency initiatives. Second, we match 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations with purchases of renewable energy. Third, we buy carbon offsets for any remaining emissions we haven\\'t yet eliminated.40\\nWhen we committed to carbon neutrality, we saw carbon offsets as an interim solution. As we work to reduce our emissions, our need for carbon offsets will continue to decrease. We reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by improving energy efficiency and procuring renewable energy. We reduce our operational Scope 3 emissions by minimizing the need for business travel through encouraging use of video conferencing tools like Google Hangouts for meetings, and facilitating employees to use sustainable commuting options for employees, such as public transit, shuttles, carpooling, or electric vehicles.\\nWhen we do purchase carbon offsets, we follow stringent principles. We invest in high-quality, third-party-verified offsets, including landfill gas projects and animal waste management systems. All our offsets are additional, meaning that the projects reduce GHG emissions that wouldn\\'t\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\\n\\n33\\n\\x0cWe will continue\\nto work toward\\nnet zero\\ncarbon in the decade\\nto come and to increase\\nthe net positive impact\\nof our products.\\n\\nbe reduced through other incentives. We also ensure that the projects we invest in are permanent sources of carbon reduction or sequestration, rather than temporary solutions. Finally, whenever possible, we invest for the long term, which offers owners and developers the financial stability they need to continue operating.\\nGoogle has been carbon neutral for twelve years, and in that time, we\\'ve partnered with more than 40 carbon offset projects to offset more than 19 million tCO2e.41 One of Google\\'s long-standing project partners is OneidaHerkimer Solid Waste Management Authority, a landfill gas project in upstate New York, United States. By enabling us to reduce our carbon footprint while reducing local air pollution, improving waste management, and increasing local revenue streams, each of these collaborations is a win for both Google and our communities.\\nOur commitment to reduce GHG emissions goes beyond our operational boundaries; some of our products enable users to reduce their own GHG emissions. For example, Google Maps and Waze Carpool help commuters reduce emissions by making transit and carpooling information more accessible. Nest thermostats help people reduce home energy consumption by controlling heating and cooling. And Project Sunroof helps users estimate potential solar energy production if they were to install rooftop solar. We will continue to work toward net zero carbon in the decade to come and to increase the net positive impact of our products.\\nLEARN MORE 2011 white paper: Google\\'s Carbon Offsets: Collaboration and Due Diligence 2017 white paper: 10 Years of Carbon Neutrality 2017 spotlight: Capturing Value from Waste in Upstate New York Website: Responsible Supply Chain\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\\n\\n34\\n\\x0cSpotlight\\nThe Internet is 24x7--carbonfree energy should be too\\nElectricity is the fuel that allows our data centers to deliver billions of Google searches, YouTube views, and much more--every single day, around the clock.

In 2011, our Google office in New York City committed to the NYC Carbon Challenge--a voluntary, public-private partnership with the mayor\\'s office in which organizations strive for a 30% reduction in GHG emissions per FTE by 2030. After meeting the 30% reduction goal early, we committed to a 50% reduction goal by 2025.43 By the end of 2018, we had already met our target seven years ahead of schedule--reducing GHG emissions by 54% per FTE at our New York City office--primarily due to various energy efficiency and emissions reductions projects.\\nWe also have a strong focus on the impacts associated with material selection, production, transportation, use, serviceability, and recycling of the products used for our spaces. We work to ensure that these products are safe for humans and the environment throughout their life cycles. We believe an industry-wide transition to safe chemistry and healthy materials is on the horizon. But making safe chemistry and healthy materials the new norm will require collective action across sectors, increased access to high-quality data that assesses chemical hazards, demand signals (from buyers like Google) to material and product manufacturers, and advancements in recycling technology and infrastructure.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nCreating sustainable workplaces\\n\\n37\\n\\x0cGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nFigure 12\\nCUMULATIVE LEED-CERTIFIED OFFICE SPACE\\nl Certified & Silver l Gold l Platinum\\n\\n-- 1.2M\\n\\n-- 0.9M\\n\\nSQUARE METERS\\n\\n-- 0.6M\\n\\n-- 0.3M\\n\\n0 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\\nConsidering local environments\\nWe take a science- and community-driven approach to managing our campuses, with the aim of having a positive impact in the places where we operate and of designing and building our offices with local environments, ecology, and animal habitats in mind. One example is the thriving egret rookery in the middle of our Mountain View, California, campus. Since 2013, the Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society (SCVAS) and Google have worked together to provide conservation guidance and educational programming for the nesting area. Conservation efforts include limiting vehicular traffic during the breeding season, establishing a protocol for collecting and caring for injured and orphaned egrets, and installing signage. Additionally, the SCVAS organizes \"Egret Office Hours,\" attracting hundreds of Googlers, community members, North Bayshore company employees, nature enthusiasts, school groups, and others to learn about the rookery.\\nAnother example is our science-based Design Guidelines for Bay Area landscaping projects. By the end of 2018, we had implemented our Habitat Design Guidelines on over 100 acres across our Bay Area headquarters. Areas once defined by lawn and hedges now host vibrant colonies of California wildflowers teeming with native bees and butterflies. These areas are studied and monitored to help inform future design decisions.\\n\\nCreating sustainable workplaces\\n\\n38\\n\\x0cGoogle\\'s offices are designed with people and the planet in mind.\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nSustainability in our offices\\nWe reduce our water footprint by installing water-saving technologies and using reclaimed water wherever possible. In 2018, we set a target to reduce potable water intensity at our Bay Area headquarters by 5% by 2019. We\\'re on track to meet this target: By the end of 2018, we achieved a 3% reduction in potable water intensity--equivalent to avoiding the use of over 42 million liters (11 million gallons) of potable water. Our current approach to global goal setting focuses on the highest-impact opportunities. We\\'re now targeting our work at Google offices in highly water-stressed locations and in offices that are supported by recycling and composting infrastructure.\\nWe implement strategies to minimize contamination in our office waste streams and identify diversion pathways that keep the waste we do generate out of landfills. In 2018, we reached 76% landfill diversion for our offices globally, and we surpassed our target to reduce landfill waste per Googler by 10% at our Bay Area headquarters--achieving a 15% reduction in landfill waste per Googler by the end of 2018. We also tracked waste generation for global offices that represent 53% of Google\\'s total headcount.\\nOur cafs and Food Spots offer nutritious, responsibly sourced meals, snacks, and beverages.44 We make thoughtful choices in the products we buy and the suppliers we buy them from. Our sustainability priorities include food waste prevention, sustainable hydration initiatives that encourage the use of reusable vessels for drinking water, and the promotion of balanced,\\n\\nCreating sustainable workplaces\\n\\n39\\n\\x0cplant-forward offerings--all of which help reduce our environmental impact and support human health and well-being. We constantly come up with inventive solutions to repurpose food and look to compost and donate leftovers wherever we\\'re legally able to do so, but we\\'ve learned that the best way to reduce food waste is to prevent it in the first place by tracking data and making adjustments. In 2018, this sort of data-driven optimization helped Google prevent more than 1 million kilograms (2.25 million pounds) of pre-consumer food waste in our cafs around the world, totaling over 3 million kilograms (6.6 million pounds) of food waste prevented since 2014. Also, by the end of 2018, 12 of our top 25 office sites were on track to reduce single-use beverages per seated headcount by 20% relative to a 2017 baseline.\\nOur Transportation team plans, implements, and operates mobility solutions to support Google\\'s global growth. We set ambitious goals for helping Googlers transition to shuttles, carpooling, public transit, biking, and walking. There are also a growing number of electric vehicles in our Google-owned and -operated commuter program fleet, with the majority of the nonelectric vehicles using renewable diesel. In 2018, our Bay Area headquarters remained on track to meet our long-term goal of reducing single-occupancy vehicle commuting to 45%. We also have a target to provide electric vehicle charging stations for 10% of total parking spaces at our Bay Area headquarters. To date, we\\'re on track to incorporate this design standard for new construction and tenant improvement projects and we\\'ve installed more than 2,700 electric vehicle charging ports at our offices in the United States.

Our Bay Area headquarters and many of our global offices host annual events to celebrate Earth Day and World Environment Day, where we share how Googlers can be sustainable on campus, at home, and in their communities. We also host an annual employee recognition program to recognize Googlers around the world who are driving sustainability across the company. The award winners are selected by members of our executive leadership team and are invited to attend an internal awards ceremony. Throughout the year we also invite thought leaders and experts to speak on the latest trends, achievements, and challenges related to sustainability, some of which are posted on the Talks at Google YouTube channel.\\nOur employees constantly reinvigorate our determination to build a better future. As we continue to explore sustainability strategies, we\\'re committed to sharing what we learn with other companies to help foster the growth of more productive, environmentally friendly businesses.\\nLEARN MORE 2018 case study: The Role of Safe Chemistry and Healthy Materials in Unlocking the Circular Economy 2018 case study: Seeding Resilience with Ecology 2018 spotlight: Ecologically focused landscapes are coming to life on Google campuses 2018 blog post: Every summer, Google\\'s campus is for the birds YouTube channel: Talks at Google\\n\\nGooglers explore different booths at Google Environment Day.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nCreating sustainable workplaces\\n\\n41\\n\\x0cSpotlight\\nThe journey toward healthier materials\\nIf you want to construct a building that\\'s healthier for people and the planet, the solution seems simple: Choose healthy materials made from safe chemistry. But, if you don\\'t have information to understand what\\'s healthier, where do you start?\\nThat\\'s the challenge we took on several years ago with the launch of our Healthy Materials Program. A natural extension of Google\\'s belief in using data to shed light and inform decision-making, the program is intended to fill the information gap between common building materials and the safety of the chemicals used to make them.\\nMore broadly, we hope to lead the market toward safer chemistry and healthier materials. We\\'ll do this through increased transparency and by continuing to use our purchasing power to underscore that material health is as important as budget and availability in the decision-making process.\\nWe\\'re currently focusing our approach to build on our successes and the lessons we\\'ve learned. Our next step is to empower everyone to join the healthy materials movement by sharing what we know.\\n\"For healthy materials to be on every shelf in every hardware store in every corner of the world, we need thousands of companies doing this with us,\" says Robin Bass, who leads the Sustainability Programs Team for Google\\'s Real Estate and Workplace Services. \"The more people that demand healthier materials, the more we move the needle.\" Read how we\\'re laying the groundwork for a safer and healthier future\\nOur Healthy Materials Program has made building spaces healthier for Googlers.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nCreating sustainable workplaces\\n\\n42\\n\\x0cBuilding better devices and services\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\n43\\n\\x0cDEVICES AND SERVICES: BY THE NUMBERS\\n29billion\\nkWh of energy savings\\nNest thermostats have helped customers cumulatively save more than 29 billion kWh of energy--nearly three times as much energy as Google used in 2018.\\n10%15%\\nenergy savings\\nOn average, Nest thermostats have proven energy savings of 10%12% for heating and 15% for cooling, which means they pay for themselves in under two years.\\n20%75%\\nrecycled plastic\\nProducts like the Nest Thermostat E, Google Home, and Chromecast all contain parts with 20%75% post-consumer recycled plastic content.\\n1 million\\nNest thermostats\\nThe Nest Power Project aims to bring 1 million energy- and money-saving Nest thermostats to families in need by 2023.\\n\\nOverview\\nAt Google, we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. And, now that our business includes building consumer hardware, our commitment remains the same. Our ambition is that every product we build will leave people, the planet, and our communities better than we found them. We\\'re at the start of a journey of reimagining how even better devices and consumer hardware experiences are created.\\nAlthough we\\'ve been making some consumer devices for a while, Google\\'s consumer hardware product area was formed just over three years ago. We\\'re working to integrate sustainability into our products, operations, and communities--making it not just an aspect of how we do business but the centerpiece of it. This is an ongoing endeavor that involves designing in sustainability from the start and embedding it into the entire product development process and across our operations, all while creating the products our customers want.\\nTo help us get a step closer to reaching our goals, in 2019 we shared a set of sustainability commitments for hardware devices and services. By 2020, 100% of all shipments going to or from customers will be carbon neutral. By 2022, 100% of Made by Google products will include recycled materials, with a drive to maximize recycled content whenever possible. And we\\'re committed to making technology that puts people first and expands access to the benefits of technology.\\nLooking ahead, we know there\\'s more work to be done. We\\'ll continue working to design energy-efficient products. We\\'ll continue working to extend the useful life of our products by making them more serviceable. And we\\'ll continue ensuring that our products are accessible for as many people as possible. We\\'re excited about the direction we\\'re headed.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nBuilding better devices and services\\n\\n44\\n\\x0cSome of Google\\'s consumer hardware products: Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3, Google Home Mini, Google Nest Hub, and Google Home\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nConsumer devices\\nOver the past few years, we\\'ve been steadily growing our family of great consumer hardware products. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful, make your life easier, and get better over time by combining the best of Google\\'s AI, software, and hardware. This is reflected in our latest generation of hardware products like Pixel 3 phones and the Google Nest Hub smart display. Creating beautiful products that people rely on every day is a journey that we\\'re investing in for the long run, and one we want to do in a sustainable way.\\nIn 2018, we launched a suite of new products, including the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL phones, Google Pixel Slate, Google Nest Hub, Google Clips, Google Nest Hello Doorbell, Google Nest Temperature Sensor, Nest x Yale Lock, Titan Security Key, and Chromecast. Other products we offer include Google Home, Google Home Max, Google Home Mini, and Google Pixelbook. We hold ourselves to the highest environmental standards and strive to ensure that Google products are designed, manufactured, and disposed of in a sustainable way. This applies to how we think about materials, manufacturing processes, energy efficiency, and packaging.\\nWe\\'re laying the foundation for what we believe will be a way of doing business that commits to building better products and services. Google has a company-level goal to increase the sustainability and circularity of our consumer electronic products, operations, and communities. We\\'ve made good progress so far, and we have great momentum.\\n\\nBuilding better devices and services\\n\\n45\\n\\x0cIn 2018 alone, Nest thermostats helped customers save nearly\\n12 billion\\nkWh of energy--more energy than Google used this year.\\n\\nFor most devices, in 2018 we began publishing product environmental reports, which help people understand the sustainability attributes of our products. Each product environmental report provides an overview of that device\\'s environmental impact in areas such as material composition, life cycle GHG emissions, and energy efficiency. Starting in 2020, we\\'ll publish product environmental reports for all of the flagship products we launch.\\nWe consider sustainability throughout the entire life cycle of a device, including its production, transportation, use, and end of life. Our product life cycle assessments give us insight into our largest opportunities for reducing the environmental impact of a given product. For example, GHG emissions from shipping are an important contributor to the environmental impact of our products. From 2017 to 2018, we reduced carbon emissions for product shipments by 40% per unit, on average, by shifting many devices from air to ocean shipping.\\nWe want to ensure that the materials and substances used for our products are safe for people and the environment, can be reused to create future products, and retain economic value. One of the keys to unlocking the circular economy is safer chemistry from the start, so in 2017, we published our Restricted Substances Specification to ensure the use of safer materials across our products.\\nWe support greener electronics standards and certifications, including UL 110, IEEE 1680.1, and the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT).45 We strive for the highest rating available for applicable products within available product categories. We\\'ve achieved EPEAT Gold registration for all current models of the Pixel 3 phone.46\\nWe also strive to make our products as energy-efficient as possible. For example, the 2018 Google Pixelbook incorporates power-management software to reduce energy consumption during use. This allowed it to attain ENERGY STAR certification, which means it has energy performance among the top 25% of similar products of its type. And in 2018 alone, Nest thermostats helped customers save nearly 12 billion kWh of energy--more energy than Google used in 2018.\\nTo accelerate the transition to a circular economy, it\\'s critical to create demand for recycled materials. To date, we\\'ve shipped millions of devices made with post-consumer recycled plastic. Products like the Nest Thermostat E, Google Home, and Chromecast all contain parts with 20% 75% post-consumer recycled plastic content.\\nCaption\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nBuilding better devices and services\\n\\n46\\n\\x0cNew plastic made from fossil fuels is the industry standard for consumer electronics, and incorporating recycled plastic involves surmounting a number of challenges. It requires building new processes and approaches while ensuring that materials meet our rigorous quality and technical specifications, costs are viable, and products are delivered on time. To meet these requirements, we spent years building partnerships with top-tier raw materials suppliers willing to invest in producing high-quality materials and innovation. Going forward, we\\'re committed to expanding the use of sustainable materials across our portfolio of products.\\nWe\\'re also making it easier for people to give their old devices a second life. Customers can responsibly recycle devices for free--whether made by Google or not--via our take-back program for all products, available in 16 countries, and via our U.S. Pixel trade-in program, through which customers can earn credit toward a new Pixel purchase.\\nOur commitments go beyond the consumer electronic products we make. We\\'re committed to minimizing our environmental impact as well as improving the lives of people who make our products. We require the highest ethical standards throughout our supply chain and are working to drive positive impacts in the communities in which we operate. Our Supplier Code of Conduct articulates our expectations for suppliers and is based on the Google Code of Conduct and on international human rights, safety, and environmental standards.\\nBuilding on the progress we\\'ve already made, in 2019, we shared our inaugural public commitments for consumer hardware. First, we aim to design products and services for circularity and to reuse materials at their highest\\n\\nThe Nest Learning Thermostat in a home\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nBuilding better devices and services\\n\\n47\\n\\x0cGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nA family using the Google Pixel Slate\\nenvironmental and social value. Many of our Nest products already include significant levels of post-consumer recycled plastic. Starting in 2022, 100% of Made by Google products will include recycled materials, and we\\'ll strive to maximize recycled content wherever possible. By decreasing our use of new materials, we\\'ll reduce our waste per device while signaling our demand for a more circular economy.\\nSecond, we aim to be the neighbor everyone wants in the communities in which we operate. By 2020, 100% of all shipping of device orders going to or from customers will be carbon neutral. To achieve carbon neutrality for shipping, we have a two-step approach: The first step is carbon reduction. Our goal is to work with shipping partners to reduce shipping emissions; we\\'ve already successfully driven a shift from air to ocean in many cases, and we\\'ll continue to look for solutions like this. For the emissions that remain, our second step will be to purchase high-quality carbon offsets. Shipping devices to consumers falls outside the scope of Google\\'s operations, and thus goes above and beyond our long-standing commitment to carbon neutrality.\\nFinally, we\\'re committed to make technology that puts people first and to expand access to the benefits of technology. One way we do this is through energy partnerships.\\n\\nBuilding better devices and services\\n\\n48\\n\\x0cGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nEnergy partnerships\\nOur products enable customers to be more thoughtful about their individual environmental impact. Connected homes can help streamline consumers\\' daily decisions about resource consumption, making sustainable choices easier for busy households. For example, smart thermostats can play a critical role in addressing climate change by automatically saving energy and helping consumers be more aware of their energy usage. These savings benefit customers, as well as the utilities generating and delivering the energy, while reducing energy use and GHG emissions.\\nThe Nest thermostat controls residential heating and cooling systems-- which make up around half of a home\\'s energy consumption--and uses AI and ML to reduce energy consumption and achieve collective savings as it learns how and when to keep users comfortable while at the same time optimizing for energy efficiency. On average, Nest thermostats have proven energy savings of 10%12% for heating and 15% for cooling,47 which means they pay for themselves in under two years as a result of those savings.48 In February 2017, the Nest Learning Thermostat became the first thermostat to achieve ENERGY STAR certification by the EPA.49 And by the end of 2018, Nest thermostats had helped customers cumulatively save more than 29 billion kWh of energy (see Figure 13), based on average savings studies-- enough energy to power all of San Francisco\\'s electricity consumption for five years and nearly three times as much energy as Google used in 2018. That\\'s\\n\\nFigure 13\\nCUMULATIVE HOUSEHOLD ENERGY SAVED BY NEST THERMOSTAT USERS\\nn Savings per year\\n\\n29.1 -- 30\\n\\n-- 25\\n\\n-- 20\\n\\n-- 15\\n\\n-- 10\\n\\n-- 5\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2018\\n\\nTHOUSAND GWh\\n\\nBuilding better devices and services\\n\\n49\\n\\x0cGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nequivalent to avoiding 9.6 million tCO2e emissions--or taking more than 2 million cars off the road for a year.50\\nWe help consumers save energy and money by forming partnerships with a variety of energy companies and service providers across North America. We\\'ve partnered with nearly 100 companies to offer Nest thermostat and demand response programs.\\nNest\\'s Rush Hour Rewards program works in partnership with utilities to reduce energy use during times of peak demand through harnessing the power of consumer engagement--acting as a leader in demand response programs for energy customers. For example, during the 2017 solar eclipse, Nest launched a special Rush Hour program with an opt-in feature that allowed Nest thermostats to automatically pre-cool customers\\' homes, reducing demand on the grid at a time when solar energy production dropped by thousands of megawatts. More than 750,000 Nest thermostats worked together across the United States to reduce demand by 700 MW.51 In 2018, Nest and partners also pioneered residential gas demand response programs. In a world of gas shortages and increasing weather variability, these programs are proving their capability to manage demand spikes and increase system flexibility.\\nWe also work with energy, government, nonprofit, and manufacturer partners to expand access to the benefits of technology through incomequalified programs. Today, nearly one in four U.S. families struggle with a high energy burden, with up to 20%50% of income going to energy bills.52 In 2018, we launched the Nest Power Project, which aims to install 1 million energy- and money-saving Nest thermostats in homes that need them most over the next five years. We\\'re proud to help our partners meet their efficiency and customer participation goals and are excited about our collective impact on consumers as well as the environment.\\nLEARN MORE 2015 white paper: Energy Savings from the Nest Learning Thermostat 2018 report: Circular Consumer Electronics: An Initial Exploration 2018 reports: Product Environmental reports 2018 report: Responsible Supply Chain Report Guidelines: Alphabet\\'s Conflict Minerals Policy and Report Guidelines: Google Supplier Code of Conduct Guidelines: Policy Against Modern Slavery and 2018 Modern Slavery Statement Guidelines: Restricted Substances Specification Website: Google Store Sustainability Website: Nest Power Project Website: Responsible Supply Chain\\n\\nBuilding better devices and services\\n\\n50\\n\\x0cSpotlight\\nNest uses energy-saving technology to relieve the low-income energy burden\\nIn the United States, low-income households spend three times as much of their income on energy as higher-income households.53 What\\'s more, many of these families live in older homes with inefficient heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, often forcing families in some parts of the United States to devote up to 50% of their monthly income toward utilities.54\\nOn Earth Day 2018, Nest and Google began tackling this energy gap with the Nest Power Project, an initiative designed to bring energy-saving technologies and assistance to those who need them most. To date, the project has donated more than $800,000 to nonprofits, such as United Way and Habitat for Humanity, that are helping connect low-income families with energy-assistance programs.\\nThe Power Project has also teamed up with nonprofits, utility companies, and mortgage financiers to install the Nest Thermostat E--a smart thermostat with proven energy-saving features--in qualified low-income households. This includes every home built by Habitat for Humanity in the United States in 2018 and low- and moderate-income households served by organizations such as Southern California Gas and Fannie Mae. Together, we aim to install 1 million energy- and money-saving Nest thermostats in low-income U.S. homes in the next five years.\\nWhile Google and Nest ultimately envision a more energy-efficient future to help combat climate change, the Power Project is working to provide energy savings for families today. \"If our thermostats and technology can help even one family stay warm this winter, we\\'ll consider it a job well done,\" says Jeff Hamel, director of energy and enterprise partnerships at Google.

Our Geo team works with numerous research and nonprofit organizations to map the world\\'s forests, fisheries, watersheds, and air quality--and even to create a global database of power plants. We then work on getting that information into the hands of decision-makers.\\nIn 2018, we launched the Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE), an online tool created in collaboration with the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy and in partnership with five pilot cities: Buenos Aires, Argentina; Melbourne, Australia; Victoria, Canada; Mountain View, California, USA; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. By analyzing Google\\'s comprehensive global mapping data together with standard GHG emission factors, EIE estimates city-scale building and transportation carbon emissions data, as well as renewable energy potential, leading to more globally consistent baselines from which cities can measure, plan, act upon, and track progress toward emissions reductions.\\nProject Sunroof is an online tool that helps users explore whether they should go solar by analyzing high-resolution aerial mapping and 3D modeling of residential roofs to sun positions, historical weather patterns, shadows cast by nearby objects, and typical electricity consumption. In 2018, Project Sunroof expanded coverage into new markets around the world, including Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, and\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nEmpowering users with technology\\n\\n55\\n\\x0cGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nthe United Kingdom. Collectively, Project Sunroof has mapped more than 107 million rooftops across 21,500 cities since 2015. Policymakers are also using Sunroof data to make bold renewable energy commitments. For example, the City of San Jos, California used the data for a city-wide solar assessment to set a 1 GW solar energy target as part of its Smart City Action Plan. In addition to city climate plans, Sunroof data is being used by some of the world\\'s largest utilities, such as Engie and E.ON, to provide customers with the option to power their homes with solar energy.\\nProject Air View measures air quality data using Google Street View cars equipped with air quality sensors. In 2018, Project Air View increased its air quality mapping efforts, expanding beyond the United States to map air quality in Copenhagen, Denmark, and London, United Kingdom. We announced plans to further expand coverage to more cities around the world by equipping 50 Street View vehicles with Aclima\\'s mobile air sensors. By the end of 2018, Project Air View had captured more than 475 million cumulative air quality measurements in 62 cities worldwide.\\nThrough Google Earth Timelapse, a global, zoomable video that lets us see how the world has changed over recent decades, we can watch as cities grow, forests disappear, glaciers recede, and lakes dry up. We can also help monitor and promote sustainable resource management with tools like Global Fishing Watch (GFW), which monitors the planet\\'s fisheries by tracking the locations and behaviors of commercial fishing fleets, powered by Google Cloud Platforms\\' machine learning algorithms. In 2018, GFW published 13 papers in top-tier journals and successfully drove new commitments and programs with governments from Canada, Indonesia, Japan, and Peru. Ultimately, our vision is to continue leveraging our mapping, cloud, and ML technologies to create a living, breathing dashboard of our planet that can help inform everyday decisions for individuals, organizations, and nations.\\nLEARN MORE 2017 report: Cities in the Circular Economy: The Role of Digital Technology 2018 spotlight: Transparency unleashed: How Global Fishing Watch is transforming fishery management 2018 blog: A tale of a whale song 2018 blog: AI for Social Good 2018 blog: Get charged up with Google Maps 2018 blog: How we explored the whole wide world with Google Earth in the past year 2018 blog: Fighting fire with machine learning: two students use TensorFlow to predict wildfires 2018 blog: The fight against illegal deforestation with TensorFlow 2018 blog: Air View is ready to expand to more places around the globe 2018 blog: Your Plan, Your Planet: How to reduce your environmental footprint\\n\\nEmpowering users with technology\\n\\n56\\n\\x0cSpotlight\\nThe more you know: Turning environmental insights into action\\nTo date, more than 10,000 cities worldwide have committed to reducing their carbon footprints by 80% within the next 30 years. But, unlike large cities like New York and Berlin, which have access to huge carbon data sets, many small and midsize cities lack the resources to gather comprehensive data on building and transportation emissions. This makes it hard to set firm carbon commitments of their own.\\nThe Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE), an online tool created by Google in collaboration with the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy, is designed to provide carbon emissions insights to cities of all sizes-- and ultimately accelerate the transition to a low-carbon future.\\nDeveloped by the Google Earth Outreach team, EIE analyzes data from Google Maps and Google\\'s other climate-related projects, like Project Sunroof, to surface insights across four categories: building emissions, transportation emissions, solar energy potential, and climate projections. EIE pairs this information with third-party data and standard GHG emissions factors, deriving carbon estimates and reduction potential for cities around the world.\\nAlthough EIE is starting with a handful of cities initially, Google eventually plans to make these insights available to thousands of towns, cities, and regions across the globe. \"Imagine what we could accomplish if every city in the world were engaged in the fight against climate change,\" says Rebecca Moore, leader of the Earth Outreach team. \"What would the world look like?\" Read how Environmental Insights Explorer is bringing insights to cities\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nThe Environmental Insights Explorer tool provides city-level carbon emissions data.\\n\\nEmpowering users with technology\\n\\n57\\n\\x0cAppendix\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\n58\\n\\x0cEnvironmental data\\nThe following table provides an overview of our performance over time and includes environmental data for our global operations, including our data centers, offices, and other facilities.\\nData for GHG emissions and energy use covers Alphabet Inc. and all of its subsidiaries, including Google LLC.

At the end of 2018, we had 15 operational campuses across 19 data center locations. Some of our locations have more than one data center campus and others were not yet operational during 2018.\\n14. According to Google\\'s own analysis of our more efficient servers, power infrastructure, and cooling systems, compared with data center industry averages. 15. See note 14 above. 16. PUE is a standard industry ratio that compares the amount of noncomputing overhead energy (used for things like cooling and power distribution) to the amount of energy used to power\\nIT equipment. A PUE of 2.0 means that for every watt of IT power, an additional watt is consumed to cool and distribute power to the IT equipment. A PUE closer to 1.0 means nearly all the energy is used for computing. 17. According to the Uptime Institute\\'s 2019 Data Center Industry Survey, the global average PUE of respondents\\' largest data centers was around 1.67. 18. This slight decline from 2017 is partly due to new sites not yet included in our energy management system and partly due to a change in how we calculate this number. 19. At Google, Zero Waste to Landfill means that when waste leaves our operating data centers, none of it goes to a landfill--100% is diverted to more sustainable pathways, with no more than 10% going to a waste-to-energy facility, unless waste to energy can be proved more valuable than alternative diversion paths. Our approach is based on UL\\'s Environmental Claim Validation Procedure for Zero Waste to Landfill. Some waste cannot be diverted away from landfill for regulatory reasons. 20.

Carbon intensity figures are based on our combined Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions, with the exception of electricity consumption intensity, which is calculated using\\nonly market-based Scope 2 at the data centers. 40. A carbon offset is an investment in an activity that reduces carbon emissions. The reduction in carbon emissions is represented by a carbon credit. The credit, usually verified by a\\nthird party, signifies that GHG emissions are lower than they would have been had no one invested in the offset. One credit equals 1 metric ton (1,000 kilograms or 2,204 pounds) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) prevented from being released into the atmosphere. 41. CO2e is a quantity that describes, for a given mixture and amount of GHG, the amount of CO2 that would have the same global warming potential (GWP), i.e., the ability of a gas to trap heat in the atmosphere when measured over a specified timescale (generally, 100 years). Some GHGs are more potent than others, as measured by their GWP. Carbon dioxide is the baseline and thus has a GWP of 1.\\nCreating sustainable workplaces\\n42. Neil E.

Alphabet\\'s fiscal year runs from January 1 to December 31. Unless otherwise specified, reported data is global. 56. GHG emissions are calculated according to WRI\\'s Greenhouse Gas Protocol. For more information on our methodology, see Alphabet\\'s 2019 CDP Climate Change Report. 57. Since 2010, we\\'ve procured renewable energy for our operations, and in 2012, we began publishing how this reduces our overall carbon footprint. Up until 2015, there was no guidance\\nfrom WRI on how to account for these emissions reductions, so we developed our own methodology, whereby on an annual basis we assigned renewable electricity procured against electricity consumed (in MWh) in the closest data center to the renewable energy project. In 2015, WRI released new guidance for market-based Scope 2 accounting, which we adopted, starting with 2015 data. Our pre-2015 methodology differs from WRI\\'s in the use of residual mixes, which avoid double-counting of claimed renewable energy attributes. 58. In 2018, to align with industry best practices for Scope 3 reporting, we extended our reporting boundaries to include emissions associated with food from our corporate offices, hardware manufacturing emissions beyond Tier 1 suppliers (full upstream to the point of extraction), use of sold products, and end-of-life treatment of sold products. Google\\'s hardware includes data center servers, networking equipment and consumer hardware products. These extended categories will be reported annually going forward. 59. In 2016, we adopted the industry practice of including only operational emissions in our carbon neutrality commitment. Our 2016 operational emissions include Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting).

We expect to invest approximately $4 billion in our second quarter alone on COVID-related initiatives getting products to customers and keeping employees safe. While this is a major commitment, it won\\'t come at the expense of our commitment to sustainability and The Climate Pledge. To do anything different would be to ignore the fact that--as the pandemic has demonstrated-- we are all interconnected and interdependent. We know there is a lot of uncertainty in the world, and we also know that during these critical times, it is more important than ever to double down on our commitments relating to the climate crisis. In 2019, we made a big bet on the capabilities of our company to innovate, use our scale for good, and go faster to address the urgency of the climate crisis. We also launched The Climate Pledge, inviting other companies to join with us on this path.\\nT HIS M OM E NT we are in now has already taught us immeasurable things about how the world can and might function going forward. The planetary pause that COVID-19 has brought about to most continents--if not all at this point--shows us what happens when some of these changes happen on our planet. Planetary stability is of course tied to economic stability and the health and well-being of all people. We have yet to see what a post-COVID recovery will entail, or what the impact will be on our ability to maintain clean air, access to health, and thriving communities. With the devastation that has occurred, there is also some optimism that we might be able learn from this moment to build back our communities with more resiliency and protections for people and our planet.\\nWe expect to invest approximately $4 billion in our second quarter alone on COVID-related\\ninitiatives getting products to customers.\\nAT AM AZON, we first began discussing the possibility of company-wide net zero commitments during a senior planning summit in 2016. We knew that to continue to be a relentlessly resilient and innovative business, we would need to deeply understand what is happening on our planet. We also knew that we would need to build and dedicate financial resources, intellectual capital, and change management work to creating the tools, data, and understanding about how to achieve these types of commitments.\\nFOU R YE ARS L AT ER , our bold commitment to integrating sustainability across the company has not changed, and it will not change another five or ten years from now. What has changed, however, is the way in which we are conducting our business, running our operations, funding and implementing new technologies and services that decarbonize and help preserve the natural world, along with the ambitious goals we have set, starting with The Climate Pledge--our commitment to reach net zero carbon by 2040, a decade ahead of the Paris Agreement. We\\'re all in on our goals and our work to build a better planet, on urgent action to drive a lasting change: to see the world transition through this current pandemic into a world that embraces a sustainable path to recovery and wellness.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY INTRODUCTION\\n\\n4\\n\\x0cAbout\\n06 Goals and Strategies 10 The Climate Pledge 12 Right Now Climate Fund 14 The Climate Pledge Fund 15 Customers 18 Amazon Around the Globe\\n\\x0cGoals and Strategies\\nAmazon is committed to building a sustainable business for our customers and the planet.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\\n\\n6\\n\\x0cOur Commitments\\nAmazon has been committed to sustainability for many years. In 2019, Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge--a commitment to be net zero carbon across our business by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. As part of this pledge, Amazon has made ambitious commitments toward reaching this goal:\\n2040 Net Zero Carbon Deploying our technology and people to reach net zero carbon across our business by 2040.\\n2030 Shipment Zero\\nMaking all Amazon shipments net zero carbon through Shipment Zero, with 50% of all shipments net zero carbon by 2030.\\n2025 Renewable Energy On a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\\n\\n7\\n\\x0c100,000 Electric Delivery Vehicles Purchasing 100,000 electric delivery vehicles, the largest order ever of electric delivery vehicles.\\n$100MM Right Now Climate Fund Investing $100 million in reforestation projects and climate mitigation solutions.\\n$2B Climate Pledge Fund\\nInvesting $2 billion to support the development of technologies and services that decarbonize and help preserve the natural world.\\nTo meet these goals, teams across Amazon are taking a broad, sciencebased approach to measuring, reducing, and eliminating carbon emissions in our operations. As part of our commitment to The Climate Pledge, we are proud to join the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), reaffirming our commitment to reduce carbon emissions in line with our ongoing sciencebased approach to tackle climate change. SBTi is a collaboration between CDP, World Resources Institute (WRI), the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC); it is one of the We Mean Business Coalition commitments.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\\n\\n8\\n\\x0cHere is a closer look at the work we are doing:\\nRenewable Energy\\nAmazon is on a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025. In 2019, we reached 42% renewable energy across our business. As of December 2020, Amazon has 127 solar and wind projects across the globe that have the capacity to generate over 6,500 megawatts and deliver more than 18 million megawatt hours of energy annually--enough to power more than 1.7 million U.S. homes.\\nShipment Zero\\nShipment Zero is Amazon\\'s vision to make all Amazon shipments net zero carbon, with a goal of delivering 50% of shipments with net zero carbon by 2030. Shipment Zero means that the fulfillment operations we undertake to deliver a customer\\'s shipment are net zero carbon--from the fulfillment center where an item is picked off the shelf, to the materials used to package the item, and the mode of transportation that gets the package to the customer\\'s door.\\nElectric Vehicles\\nIn 2019, Amazon ordered 100,000 new electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, a U.S. electric vehicle manufacturer. This order, the largest order ever of electric delivery vehicles, sends a signal to the marketplace to start inventing and developing new technologies that large, global companies need to transition to a low-carbon economy. Amazon plans to have 10,000 of the new electric vehicles on the road as early as 2022 and all 100,000 vehicles on the road by 2030.\\nSustainable Packaging\\nAmazon created our Frustration-Free Packaging program to encourage manufacturers to package their products in easy-to-open, 100% recyclable packaging that is ready to ship to customers without the need for an additional shipping box. Since 2015, we have reduced the weight of outbound packaging by 33% and eliminated more than 900,000 tons of packaging material, the equivalent of 1.6 billion shipping boxes.\\nRight Now Climate Fund\\nAmazon established the Right Now Climate Fund, a $100 million fund to restore and conserve forests, wetlands, and grasslands around the world. Through the Right Now Climate Fund, Amazon is taking immediate action to remove or avoid carbon emissions by supporting nature-based climate solutions. Amazon is working with The Nature Conservancy to identify projects around the world that can create real and lasting carbon reductions, while also empowering communities, enhancing natural environments, and protecting wildlife.\\nClimate Pledge Fund\\nIn June 2020, Amazon announced The Climate Pledge Fund to support the development of sustainable and decarbonizing technologies and services that will enable Amazon and other companies to meet the goals set by The Climate Pledge. This dedicated investment program--with an initial $2 billion in funding--will invest in visionary companies whose products and solutions will facilitate the transition to a low carbon economy.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\\n\\n9\\n\\x0cThe Climate Pledge was founded in 2019 by Amazon and Global Optimism.

Through the Right Now Climate Fund, we are taking immediate action to remove or avoid carbon emissions by supporting nature-based climate solutions.\\nPriorities of the Right Now Climate Fund\\nWe support nature-based solutions, which refer to conservation, restoration, and improved land management actions that increase carbon storage or avoid greenhouse gas emissions in forests, wetlands, and grasslands across the globe.\\n Support \"And/Also\" Solutions: We use multiple solutions to reduce carbon emissions--driving reductions across our business operations and also supporting nature-based solutions.\\n Demonstrate Immediate Action: We demonstrate immediate action toward reducing carbon in the atmosphere and mitigating the adverse effects of climate change.\\n Promote Global Scale: We catalyze and promote nature-based solutions globally, and prioritize projects that can be scaled broadly.\\n Optimize for Carbon Mitigation: We fund projects that optimize for carbon removed or avoided, while also being additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially-beneficial.\\n Improve Market Mechanisms: We improve market mechanisms in order to increase the worldwide quality, supply, and demand for carbon offsets.\\nGlobal Projects\\nAmazon is working with The Nature Conservancy to identify projects that can create real and lasting carbon reductions, while also empowering communities, enhancing natural environments, and protecting wildlife.\\nFamily Forest Carbon Program and Forest Carbon Co-ops: In April 2020, Amazon announced the funding of $10 million toward two projects that will help U.S. family forest owners sequester carbon and support expansion across Appalachia and other U.S. regions. Scientists at The Nature Conservancy have identified this network of climate-resilient forests as most able to thrive in the face of climate change. Amazon, The Nature Conservancy, the American Forest Foundation, and the Vermont Land Trust are partnering on two innovative projects--the Family Forest Carbon Program and Forest Carbon Co-ops.\\nThe Family Forest Carbon Program will open up carbon credit markets to small family forest owners for the first time. Amazon\\'s commitment will expand the program in the Appalachians and other U.S. regions and go towards designing new methods for measuring and verifying reforestation and forest management practices. The Forest Carbon Co-op will help owners of mid-sized forests use sustainable forest management and protection measures to earn income through the\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\\n\\n12\\n\\x0ccarbon credit market. Amazon\\'s grant will support efforts to expand the program in climate resilient forests across the Appalachians, develop a scientific approach to regional carbon impact measurement, and enhance the project verification methodology. Amazon is the largest funder of these programs and will help:\\n Conserve and sustainably manage forest land and wildlife in the Appalachian region, with plans to expand the projects across 4 million acres of the 2,000-mile span of the Appalachians, and beyond.\\n Generate economic opportunities by creating a new source of income for family forest owners and rural communities that taps into the carbon storage potential of forests. In the U.S., families and individuals own the largest portion of forests (38%)--more than the federal government or corporations.\\n Achieve a net reduction of up to 18.5 million metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere by 2031--the equivalent of the emissions of nearly 4 million U.S. cars in a year.\\nUrban Greening in Germany: Amazon is supporting The Nature Conservancy in an effort to reduce climate change risks and increase species biodiversity in three German cities. The initial project is in Berlin\\'s Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district. Learnings will be applied in two other German locations, and then shared across other European cities. With this, Amazon is recognizing the urgency of the climate crisis and its impacts on urban communities.\\nAmazon\\'s commitment will fund The Nature Conservancy\\'s Urban Greening program, which uses nature-based solutions to help cities become more climate-change resilient. The program will collaborate with city officials and local community organizations to create and implement plans for:\\n Reducing flood risk by improving rainwater retention through tree planting, revitalizing urban wetlands, and adapting existing green spaces;\\n Reducing extreme heat and pollution by leveraging unused public spaces to plant trees and improving urban water bodies;\\n Increasing urban biodiversity by introducing pollinator-friendly species, climate resilient plants, and urban grasslands.\\nThe program starts in the Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district of Berlin and uses a science-based, municipality-wide, and stakeholder-based approach to urban greening to ensure that projects are complementing existing local efforts. Two additional German cities will be chosen, in which the initial learnings from Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf will be applied. The goal is to share a guide to urban greening with municipalities across Europe by the end of the five-year project.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\\n\\n13\\n\\x0cThe Climate Pledge Fund\\nIn June 2020, Amazon announced The Climate Pledge Fund to support the development of sustainable and decarbonizing technologies and services that will enable Amazon and other companies to meet the goals set by The Climate Pledge. This dedicated investment program--with an initial $2 billion in funding--will invest in visionary companies whose products and solutions will facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy.\\nIn order to meaningfully reduce the amount of net greenhouse gas emissions, low-carbon solutions need to be developed in all sectors of the global economy. The Climate Pledge Fund will invest in companies in multiple industries, with an initial focus on: transportation and logistics; energy generation, storage, and utilization; manufacturing and materials; circular economy; and food and agriculture. Companies of all sizes and stages will be considered, from preproduct startups to well-established enterprises looking to scale. The scope of The Climate Pledge Fund is global and will consider investments in companies developing products or services that reduce carbon emissions and help preserve the natural world.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\\n\\n14\\n\\x0cCustomers\\nAmazon is committed to making it easier for our customers to participate in making a positive impact on the planet and society.\\n\\nsmile.amazon.com\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\\n\\n15\\n\\x0cEnabling Sustainability for our Customers\\nAmazon has set ambitious goals to make our business more sustainable on behalf of customers.

We measure our total impact on the climate, map the largest activities contributing to this impact, and use this information to develop meaningful carbon reduction goals, including our overall goal to reach net zero carbon across Amazon by 2040.\\nOur carbon footprint includes emissions from Amazon-operated and third-party freight, electricity use, Amazon branded products, capital goods, business travel, packaging, customer trips to Amazon\\'s stores, and other purchased goods and services. The system boundary of our carbon footprint meets widely adopted international standards, including the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and ISO 14064. Our carbon footprint is externally assured by Apex.\\nThrough our commitment to The Climate Pledge, Amazon is investing in a range of large-scale solutions to decarbonize our business, some with immediate carbon savings and others with longerterm payoffs. We have already seen an improvement in the carbon intensity of our business in 2019 as a result of operational efficiencies such as energy efficiency technologies in fulfillment centers and alternative vehicle pilots. Carbon intensity is the metric we use to benchmark our performance year over year, as it provides a relative comparison between annual performance metrics regardless of other changes to our business. While Amazon\\'s net sales increased 22% in 2019 (excluding changes in foreign exchange rates), our total carbon footprint increased 15% during the same period. While still early days, our 2019 carbon intensity metric is 122.8 grams of CO2e per GMS, down 5% year over year from 128.9 grams of CO2e per dollar in 2018.\\nLike many companies in high growth mode, we look at the absolute tons of carbon in our footprint, but also at how we are improving our carbon intensity. Our first year-over-year comparison shows progress as we continue to make investments in innovation, technologies, and products that will decarbonize our operations over future years.\\nThese investments include renewable energy projects like our new solar farm in Virginia, and our order of 100,000 electric delivery vehicles, which will be on the road delivering packages to customers starting in 2021. It will take several years for the carbon reduction benefits of these investments to be fully reflected in our carbon footprint. Over time, both our carbon intensity and our absolute carbon footprint will drop as we continue to make progress toward net zero carbon. With the launch of The Climate Pledge Fund, we look forward to making additional major investments in the coming years that will result in long-term payoffs.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n21\\n\\x0cAmazon\\'s 2019 Carbon Footprint Categories\\n\\nMMT COe\\n\\nEmissions from Direct Operations (Scope 1) Fossil Fuels Refrigerants\\n\\n5.76 5.57 0.19\\n\\nEmissions from Purchased Electricity (Scope 2)\\n\\n5.50\\n\\nEmissions from Indirect Sources (Scope 3)\\n\\n39.91\\n\\nCorporate purchases and Amazon-branded product emissions (e.g., operating expenses, business travel, and Amazon-branded product manufacturing, use phase, and end of life)\\n\\n15.41\\n\\nCapital goods (e.g., building construction, servers and other 8.01\\nhardware, equipment, vehicles)\\n\\nOther indirect emissions (e.g., third-party transportation, packaging, grid line losses)\\n\\n12.44\\n\\nLifecycle emissions from customer trips to Amazon\\'s physical stores\\n\\n4.05\\n\\nAmazon\\'s Total Footprint\\n\\n51.17\\n\\nOur carbon intensity metric, measured as grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (COe) per dollar of Gross Merchandise Sales (GMS), is equal to 122.8 COe per dollar (USD).\\n\\nCarbon Methodology\\nLearn more about the science and technology behind our carbon footprint. amzn.to/measuring-carbon\\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions Verification Statement\\nRead the greenhouse gas emissions verification statement from Apex. amzn.to/carbon-assurance\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n22\\n\\x0cRenewable Energy\\nAmazon is on a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025 as part of our goal to reach net zero carbon by 2040.

Customer shipments pass through the following types of facilities, all powered by clean energy:\\n Fulfillment centers where Amazon associates pick, pack, and ship customer orders;  Sortation centers where customer orders are sorted by final destination and then consolidated for delivery;  Delivery stations where orders are prepared for last-mile delivery to a customer\\'s door.\\nMore than 60 Amazon facilities across the globe are already powered by on-site solar panels, which generate as much as 80% of a single fulfillment facility\\'s annual energy needs.\\nPackaging\\nA Shipment Zero order will be shipped without added Amazon packaging or in carbon neutral packaging. Ships In Own Container (SIOC) is a tier of certification within Amazon\\'s Frustration-Free Packaging program, certifying that a product\\'s original packaging is designed to ship without the need for an Amazon shipping box. We work closely with manufacturers to develop and test packaging that meets SIOC certification, and we share these innovations publicly to drive improvements across the industry. In India, we designed a new way to deliver customer orders packaging-free. Orders that ship in their original packaging are delivered in a protective, reusable crate in 100+ cities across India.\\nA second option is to ship in carbon neutral packaging that is made of net zero carbon materials, is produced with zero carbon emissions, and is delivered to Amazon fulfillment facilities using zero carbon. While we work to increase SIOCcertified products, expand packaging-free shipping programs, and develop carbon neutral packaging solutions, we will continue to pursue packaging improvements by optimizing the size and weight of shipping materials, inventing new recyclable mailers, and working with suppliers to streamline and innovate product packaging.\\nTransportation\\nA Shipment Zero order will be transported in a zero-emissions delivery vehicle or by a delivery associate on foot or on bicycle. Zero-emissions delivery vehicles are 100% battery electric or hydrogen-fueled, in addition to electric bikes and electric three-wheelers. Amazon\\'s order of 100,000 electric delivery vehicles in 2019 is a major stride toward zero carbon transportation across our global network, and we are proud to operate many electric vans and trucks today. We also leverage innovative technology to maximize efficiency on the road and reduce delivery distances by placing delivery stations close to large Amazon customer populations.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n25\\n\\x0cSustainable Transportation\\nTransportation is a major component of Amazon\\'s business operations and a key part of our plan to meet net zero carbon by 2040. We are committed to optimizing and transforming our transportation network through innovations in electrification, efficiency enhancements, and alternative delivery methods.\\n\\nElectrifying Our Transport Fleets\\nIn 2019, Amazon ordered 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, a U.S. electric vehicle manufacturer. This order, the largest order ever of electric delivery vehicles, sends a signal to the marketplace to start inventing and developing new technologies that large, global companies need to transition to a low-carbon economy. We plan to start using these new vehicles from Rivian to deliver packages to customers by 2021, with 10,000 new vehicles on the road as early as 2022 and all 100,000 vehicles on the road by 2030. This is projected to save millions of metric tons of carbon per year by 2030.\\nAmazon already operates hundreds of electric vehicles across the globe. Amazon India is adding 10,000 electric delivery vehicles to its existing fleet by 2025, including 3-wheeler and 4-wheeler vehicles designed and manufactured in India. These vehicles are in addition to Amazon\\'s order of 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from Rivian. Across Europe, Amazon is contracting with our service providers to launch a low-pollution last-mile fleet comprised of electric and natural gas vans and cars. We have added hundreds of electric vehicle charging stations at our European facilities for our partners to use, with plans to expand this infrastructure to support more sustainable deliveries. We use electric cargo bikes in cities around the world, including a pilot in New York City in 2019. In North America, Amazon has also deployed electric yard hostlers, which are used to move trailers around facilities.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n26\\n\\x0cMaximizing Efficiency on Current Vehicles\\nWhile we work to adopt the most efficient, cutting-edge vehicle technologies, we are also maximizing efficiencies on our existing fleets. Across North America and Europe, our fleet includes a mix of trailers in different sizes that are equipped with skirts (panels attached to the lower side edges of a trailer to make it more aerodynamic) and automatic tire inflation systems that keep tires properly inflated and maximize fuel efficiency.\\nWe use mud flaps designed to allow airflow and water to pass through them, minimizing drag and saving an average of 100 gallons of diesel fuel per vehicle annually. In Europe, we have deployed over 500 hydraulically powered doubledeck trailers. Double-deck trailers improve space utilization by up to 70% in comparison to standard semi-trailers, reducing the total number of trucks on the road.\\nOptimizing Our Delivery Logistics\\nAmazon is constantly working to optimize our delivery network and drive efficiencies in the process of delivering our products. To fulfill customer orders quickly, we have thousands of vehicles moving from fulfillment centers to delivery destinations. We use data and algorithms to consolidate as many shipments as possible onto one vehicle or plane. We also analyze which items are being ordered most frequently, by location, to ensure that the inventory of those items is stored nearby, minimizing the need to use planes or trucks for long-distance deliveries. By boosting efficiencies across our network, we are able to put fewer vehicles and planes into service.\\nUsing Alternative Delivery Methods\\nWe are continually piloting new or alternative ideas in different locations around the world in an effort to increase our efficiency and reduce emissions. In urban centers like New York City, we deliver packages on foot, have expanded our use of traditional bicycles, and use pedal-assist electric bikes connected to cargo trailers that can carry up to 45 packages. In India, our fleet includes electric three-wheelers and compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles. Electric bikes and CNG vehicles are also part of our delivery fleet in Europe. Additionally, we\\'re developing fully electric autonomous delivery services, such as the Amazon Scout device and Prime Air drones, which will make deliveries faster and more efficient than road deliveries.\\nPartnering with Experts and Industry\\nIn 2017, Amazon signed the Sustainable Fuel Buyers\\' Principles, demonstrating our commitment to working with service providers to accelerate the transition to low-carbon commercial transportation solutions. Members of the nonprofit Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) Future of Fuels group developed The Buyers\\' Principles and vetted them through its network of 600 expert and industry stakeholders. These principles outline criteria that will catalyze the partnerships needed to drive the transition to a sustainable road freight transportation system.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n27\\n\\x0cSustainable Buildings\\nAs part of our commitment to The Climate Pledge, Amazon is working to reduce the carbon emissions associated with our buildings and facilities across the globe. We are transitioning our buildings to be net zero carbon, powered by renewable energy, and highly energy efficient, with demonstrated reductions in embodied carbon--the emissions associated with a building\\'s construction materials.\\nWe are also working to improve the resource efficiency of our buildings beyond energy, with a focus on water and waste reduction strategies across our facilities. In all of our buildings, we seek to create safe, productive, and inspiring spaces that support the health and well-being of our employees, local environment, and community, both inside and outdoors.\\nGreen Building Standards\\nWe are committed to holding our buildings to the highest standards of sustainable design, and we pursue third-party building certification when doing so accelerates our impact. Amazon has nearly 30 LEED certified buildings in the U.S. --the majority of which have Gold and Platinum level certification--and more than 20 BREEAM certified buildings across Europe. We also engage with industry-leading programs that support the transition to net zero carbon in the built environment, such as the Carbon Leadership Forum.\\nCorporate Offices\\nOur global corporate offices are often located in vibrant communities and urban hubs. When designing our offices, we strive to integrate seamlessly with these communities while creating easy outdoor access for our employees and visitors. Many of our buildings offer public plazas and open green spaces for communal and public use. Even more feature green roofs and other green infrastructure that provide outdoor amenity space while supporting ecological functions like stormwater management.\\nOur buildings\\' interiors integrate biophilic design concepts, such as green walls and locally-sourced woods, in addition to energy-efficient lighting, composting and recycling, and amenity spaces for employee wellness. Many Amazon buildings also offer plug-in electric vehicle charging stations for employees and visitors.\\nSustainability in Action at Our Seattle Campus: Our flagship Seattle campus features some of our most innovative sustainable design practices. A subterranean district energy system heats many of our buildings in the Denny Triangle neighborhood using waste heat generated from a neighboring data center. Above ground, employees and visitors can enjoy The Spheres, an indoor plant conservatory featuring 40,000 plants from the cloud forest regions of more than 30 countries, along with a 4,000 square foot green wall.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n28\\n\\x0c100% Renewable Energy at HQ2 in Arlington: Our second U.S. headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, known as \"HQ2,\" will use 100% renewable energy to power the four-million-square-foot campus, which is scheduled to be completed by 2022. We are constructing a new solar farm in Pittsylvania County, Virginia to power HQ2 and other Amazon-owned operations in the area, including Whole Foods Market stores and nearby fulfillment centers. A portion of the renewable energy generated from this solar farm will be allocated to Arlington County, a move that also helps advance the county\\'s renewable energy goals. The location for the HQ2 campus was strategically determined to provide walkable access to public transportation, bike storage, and local amenities such as shops, restaurants, and childcare.\\nInternational Offices: We aim to take best practices from across our global locations and embed them at our offices all over the world. Our corporate offices in Munich, Germany, have been certified Gold for environmental design by the German Sustainable Building Council based on their energy-efficient interiors and use of sustainable building materials. In Luxembourg, efficient chillers and an advanced building management system cut energy costs, while rooftop beehives supply honey, and food is served in compostable and biodegradable containers.\\nOperations Facilities\\nWith more than 175 facilities covering 150 million square feet of space across the world, Amazon fulfillment centers, sortation centers, and delivery stations account for a major part of our embodied carbon. In 2020, Amazon began an in-depth study of our operations buildings in order to transition these facilities to net zero carbon. The study examines the energy intensity of these buildings and identifies ways to meet zero carbon through energy efficiency enhancements, new technology pilots, and significant reductions in embodied carbon. This year, Amazon will update its design templates and criteria to capture these changes, and apply net zero strategies across all global regions.\\nOn-Site Solar: Many of our facilities throughout the U.S., Europe, and India are powered by on-site solar, where a rooftop installation can power up to 80% of a facility\\'s energy use. In 2019, we achieved a goal to install solar technology on 50 rooftops worldwide by 2020, a year ahead of schedule. We now have more than 60 rooftop solar installations on operations facilities around the world and we continue to scale this program.\\nMinimizing Energy Use at Operations Facilities: Our operations facilities are designed with efficient building systems to minimize energy use. We are expanding our use of building control system technology and real-time data analytics to optimize our heating and cooling systems for occupant comfort while operating as efficiently as possible. We use highly-efficient motors and advanced controls in our conveyor systems to move packages efficiently throughout our facilities, and we are testing new technologies to further reduce the energy use of material handling equipment. Through building retrofits and energy studies, we are continuously improving and learning to optimize the efficiency of our operations, uncover savings opportunities, and help drive carbon out of our fulfillment operations.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n29\\n\\x0cData Centers\\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) has always focused on efficiency and continuous innovation in our data centers to improve operational excellence and reduce our impact on the environment. In addition to our efforts on energy efficiency and our goal to achieve 100% renewable energy for our global infrastructure, AWS has multiple initiatives to improve our water use efficiency and reduce the use of potable (drinking) water for cooling data centers.\\nAWS develops our water use strategy by evaluating climate patterns for each AWS Region (a physical location around the world where we cluster data centers), local water management and availability, and the opportunity to conserve drinking water sources. Taking a holistic approach, we assess both the water and energy usage of each potential cooling solution to select the most efficient method.\\nWhole Foods Market\\nWhole Foods Market has several all-electric stores in California and dozens of buildings certified by LEED and Green Globes across North America. Every store provides a high-quality indoor experience for employees and customers, with ample daylight and amenity space. Stores in the San Francisco Bay Area have piloted a technology that combines advanced cloud computing, predictive analytics, and a thermal energy storage retrofit to modulate their refrigeration systems during peak energy.\\nWhole Foods Market is a founding partner of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\\'s GreenChill program, which helps food retailers transition to alternative refrigerants, reduce refrigerant charge sizes, eliminate leaks, and adopt green refrigeration technologies. Whole Foods Market has piloted various technologies to reduce carbon emissions from the use of refrigerants. For example, multiple stores across the U.S. and Canada use natural refrigerants, which contain zero ozone depletion potential and very low global warming potential.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n30\\n\\x0cCircular Economy\\nWe are minimizing waste, increasing recycling, and providing options for our customers to\\nreuse, repair, and recycle their products--sending less material to the landfill and more back into the circular economy loop.\\n\\n31\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n31\\n\\x0cRecycling\\nAmazon is committed to reducing our environmental footprint through recycling initiatives in our own operations and for our customers. We are developing new recycling infrastructure, inventing recyclable packaging materials, and investing in initiatives that support the recycling industry across the U.S.\\nRecycling Infrastructure\\nIn addition to optimizing our recycling efforts for common materials like cardboard, we are working to address the materials that are toughest to recycle in our operations. Plastic film, for example, is a difficult material to process and recycle, and is not accepted by most curbside recycling programs. To address this gap, Amazon is launching plastic film recycling at more than 55 fulfillment centers across our network. Through this program, we expect to recycle more than 7,000 tons of plastic film per year, in addition to the 1,500 tons of plastic already being recycled annually in Europe.\\nWe are also exploring alternative solutions for less common materials that cannot be recycled. In the UK, for example, we collect the silicone backing paper from shipping labels to convert into animal bedding. We are looking across our entire operations network to incorporate more of our own recycled plastic in products, packaging, and operational processes.\\nRecyclable Mailers\\nIn 2019, we launched a fully recyclable paper padded mailer that protects products during shipping while taking up less space in transit. This ensures customer deliveries arrive undamaged and in recyclable packaging with a lower carbon footprint. The recyclable mailer is made of four layers of paper and a water-based cushioning material using components commonly found in the glue used to make cardboard. The lightweight recyclable cushioning was specifically designed to easily separate from the paper in the same way that print inks and other paper coatings are removed during the paper recycling process.\\nRecycling Partnerships\\nAt Amazon, we know our customers care about minimizing the amount of waste that ends up in landfill. To improve curbside recycling in the U.S., we partnered with The Recycling Partnership, which supports communities and local governments with education, infrastructure, and measurement related to curbside recycling.\\nWe also invested $10 million in the Closed Loop Infrastructure Fund to finance recycling and circular economy infrastructure in North America. Through this investment, Amazon aims to increase product and packaging recycling, ensuring that material gets back into the manufacturing supply chain. Over the next decade, our investment in the Closed Loop Infrastructure Fund will improve curbside recycling for 3 million homes in communities across the U.S., diverting 1 million tons of recyclable material from landfill and eliminating the equivalent of 2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n32\\n\\x0cAmazon Second Chance\\nAmazon Second Chance provides information on how to trade in, recycle, or repair products, how to recycle Amazon packaging, and how to find open-box and refurbished devices. Customers may visit Second Chance to learn about and compare programs that help eliminate waste and give products a second life.\\namzn.to/amsc\\nCustomers who have eligible items they no longer want can discover the Amazon Trade-In program, which allows them to receive an Amazon.com Gift Card in exchange for thousands of eligible items including Amazon devices, cell phones, video games, and more. In addition, customers wanting to responsibly dispose of their electronics can discover our device recycling program for a variety of electronics and related accessories.\\nAmazon also gives customers several options to shop for great deals on open-box or gently-used items. Amazon Warehouse --an online store for great deals on quality used products including furniture, toys, instruments, kitchen appliances, clothes, and more--has an extensive inspection process that ensures as many gently-used returned items as possible can be resold rather than being sent to landfill. Amazon Renewed offers refurbished, pre-owned, and open-box products such as computers, laptops, smartphones, tablets, cameras, audio devices, home appliances, and more. And Certified Refurbished and Used Amazon Devices provides customers access to pre-owned Amazon devices such as Echo, Fire Tablets, Kindle E-readers, and more. Certified Refurbished devices have been refurbished, tested, and internally certified by Amazon to look and work like new. All of these programs reduce waste and encourage reuse by ensuring that valuable products can go back into the hands of customers rather than being sent to landfills.\\nAmazon also encourages customers to fix the things they buy before replacing, returning, or disposing of them. Amazon offers free Product Support (on a select but growing number of items) with the goal of helping customers maximize the useful life of the things they already own. Product Support serves seven global geographies with technical support, parts replacement, and repair services. Helping customers responsibly dispose of Amazon packaging is another key component of Second Chance. Customers are able to view various types of Amazon packaging and are provided with instructions on how and where to dispose of the materials.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n33\\n\\x0cProduct Donations\\nAt Amazon facilities around the world, we are continuously expanding initiatives to maximize the positive impact of our surplus inventory. We contribute food and non-food product donations to hundreds of food banks and nonprofits, reducing landfill waste and helping our local communities.\\nAmazon partners with Feeding America and Good360 to donate surplus inventory and distribute products to communities in need across the U.S. In 2019, Amazon and Whole Foods Market donated 37.5 million meals and 200,000 pounds (90,700 kilograms) of household essentials to Feeding America through its donation program.\\nThroughout countries in Europe, we collaborate with local food banks and non-food charities to donate products to communities in need. Amazon is a long-term partner of the German nonprofit Innatura, which brokers in-kind donations to charitable organizations. Through this partnership, Amazon has donated to more than 1,500 charities benefiting nearly 500,000 individuals and families in Germany with donations including toys, shoes, clothing, and drugstore items, among others.\\nAmazon works with In Kind Direct, a national charity in the UK that manages the donation of surplus products to charities across the country. Since partnering with In Kind Direct, we have donated more than $8.7 million (7 million) worth of products. In 2019 alone, we donated $1.2 million (1 million) to over 2,000 charities and voluntary organizations across the UK.\\nAmazon is also investing in automated systems that enable third-party sellers to donate their surplus inventory to local charities. This new program has quickly become popular, with 97% of sellers on Amazon in the U.S. opting to donate their surplus inventory. This program also launched in the UK with nine local charity partners and will expand to France by the end of 2020. In the last three months of 2019 alone, third-party sellers donated a combined 3 million products to communities in need through this new automated system.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n34\\n\\x0cPackaging and Products\\nWe are redesigning packaging to reduce waste and making our private-label products\\nand devices in responsible ways.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n35\\n\\x0cReducing Packaging Waste\\nOur customers want right-sized, recyclable packaging that minimizes waste and ensures damage-free delivery. We work to reinvent and simplify our sustainable packaging options using a science-based approach that combines lab testing, machine learning, materials science, and manufacturing partnerships to scale sustainable change across the packaging supply chain.\\nSustainable Packaging Initiatives\\nOur sustainable packaging initiatives reduce waste and make it easier for customers to remove products from packaging. Unlike traditional retail stores, products bought online don\\'t need the elaborate packaging used for displaying products on store shelves. Instead, customers use star ratings and reviews to guide their online shopping decisions.\\nOur Frustration-Free Packaging (FFP) program encourages manufacturers to package their products in easy-to-open packaging that is 100% recyclable and ready to ship to customers without additional Amazon boxes. Since 2015, we have reduced the weight of outbound packaging by 33% and eliminated more than 900,000 tons of packaging material, the equivalent of 1.6 billion shipping boxes.\\nTo certify products under Amazon\\'s FFP program, we help manufacturers innovate and improve their packaging functionality. By testing products in a dedicated, state-of-the-art lab in Seattle and in our fulfillment centers across the globe, we identify specific steps that manufacturers can take to\\nimprove their packaging and ensure products are protected all the way to the customer\\'s doorstep.\\nToday, more than 2 million products qualify under our FFP program. Philips, for example, was inspired by our FFP program to reinvent their packaging. The new Norelco OneBlade razor design now has 80% less packaging volume, is fully recyclable, and delights customers with print on the inside of the box which enhances the opening experience\\nMachine Learning\\nHow big of a box is needed for a given product? Is an Amazon box needed at all? To find out, we use machine learning algorithms to arrive at the best possible packaging choices for deliveries. That means identifying which products don\\'t need packaging at all, and which smaller products are suitable for envelopes or mailers. In cases where the protection of a box is needed, algorithms help us continuously optimize box choices to fit our ever-changing catalog. Computer-aided engineering also helps us redesign boxes to use less material while making sure customer orders are protected. These improvements\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n36\\n\\x0creduce volume per shipment, which means less unnecessary packaging and more efficient use of all forms of transportation, reducing carbon in small amounts to create a larger impact across our network.\\nWe also use machine learning to help target products where even small packaging improvements can have significant impacts on reducing waste. We developed a machine learning model to identify liquid products with the highest average rates of customer reported damages. We then subjected those products to extensive additional testing at our Amazon Packaging Lab, where we simulate a package\\'s journey from the manufacturer to the customer.\\nThrough this process, we\\'ve teamed up with companies like Rieke--a packaging solutions firm that makes dispensing systems for personal care, food, and healthcare products--to provide data and packaging insights on many of the conventional dispensing systems that are used in millions of products on Amazon. By strengthening materials, creating new locking mechanisms to prevent pumps from twisting open, and sealing potential leak points, Rieke\\'s team has created dispensers specially designed to withstand the journey to the customer. These new and improved designs include trigger sprayers common on household cleaners and personal care products, pumps for lotions, and pumps for foams.\\nEngaging with Vendors and Industry\\nWe work with top brands and vendors to reinvent their packaging for waste reduction in e-commerce, including optimized packaging that allow products to be shipped in their own container. The toy maker Hasbro, for example, redesigned the packaging for its popular toy, Baby Alive, reducing both the amount of material used and the overall package size by more than 50%. The pet food company Hill\\'s Pet Nutrition reworked its packaging to make bags of kibble less likely to break and spill during shipment; testing at Amazon validated the redesigned packaging.\\nWe are working across the packaging industry, using new analytics and test methods, new materials, and new ways to build enclosures that protect customer products. With packaging suppliers, for example, we have developed solutions for liquid dispensing systems on hard-to-ship items, such as household cleaners and personal care products, preventing spills and the need for extra packaging to contain spills if they happen.\\nAmazon is a member of the Sustainable Packaging Coalition (SPC), an industry working group dedicated to a more robust environmental vision for packaging. SPC uses strong member support, an informed and science-based approach, supply chain collaborations, and continuous outreach to design packaging that encourages a sustainable flow of materials. Amazon has also joined the International Safe Transit Association (ISTA), an organization focused on the specific concerns of transport packaging. ISTA is a nonprofit, member-driven association that sets the standards for optimizing the resources in packages that are designed to be survivable, sustainable, and successful.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n37\\n\\x0cSustainable Products and Materials\\nAmazon aims to be Earth\\'s most customer-centric company, which means giving our customers access to the sustainable products they want. From thousands of Amazon-branded products to millions of retail and third-party items sold on Amazon, we are working to reduce the environmental impact of the products we manufacture and provide customers more information about the sustainability attributes associated with the items we sell.\\n\\nSustainable products cover a range of attributes intended to preserve the natural world, and we strive to help Amazon customers easily discover and shop products that exceed the environmental benefits of comparable products.\\nFor Amazon-owned Private Brand products and Amazon devices, we work with many of the manufacturers and suppliers that produce our private-label selection to drive sustainability improvements through materials and ingredients, design, sourcing, and manufacturing technology. Our global teams also work closely with suppliers to communicate our human rights standards, and help suppliers build their capacity to provide safe and respectful working environments.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n38\\n\\x0cHousehold Goods\\nMany Amazon customers prioritize safety and sustainability when it comes to household goods like cleaning supplies and personal care products. Customers want to be sure the products they buy are safe for their families and help preserve the planet, without compromising on quality or price.\\nWe are working to increase the sustainable attributes of many of our Private Brand selections, from bio-based laundry and dish soaps that offer an effective, alternative choice to conventional formulas, to beauty products that are formulated without harmful chemicals. As part of that commitment, we implemented a Chemicals Policy and Restricted Substance List (RSL), both of which apply to Amazon-owned baby, household cleaning, personal care, and beauty brands. To support the broader retail sector\\'s collaborative effort to use safer formulations and produce more sustainable products, Amazon joined the Retail Leadership Council of the Green Chemistry and Commerce Council (GC3).\\nWe also take an active role in promoting sustainability with our selling partners. For example, we teamed up with Procter & Gamble to develop the Tide Eco-Box, a concentrated version of Tide\\'s traditional laundry detergent compressed into a fully recyclable, shipping-safe package, which is produced using 60% less plastic and 30% less water than a conventional plastic jug. Countless other Amazon selling partners offer biodegradable and plant-based options for staples like dish detergent and multi-purpose cleaners.\\nFood and Grocery\\nSustainable food selection means something different to each customer. Across our Amazon food and grocery businesses, we make it easy for customers to find a range of options like free range, pasture-fed, organic, and fair trade groceries.\\nAs sellers of animal-derived products, we recognize our responsibility to uphold animal welfare within our supply chain. We expect our suppliers to uphold the Five Freedoms framework for animal welfare, including freedom from hunger and thirst; freedom from discomfort; freedom from pain, injury, or disease; freedom to express normal behavior; and freedom from fear and distress. We expect our suppliers to comply with all applicable laws and to take a zero-tolerance approach to animal cruelty, abuse, and neglect. We encourage suppliers to continuously improve their animal welfare standards and practices, and to work towards recognized animal welfare certifications or industry guidelines that include welfare provisions.\\nAt Whole Foods Market in the U.S., we sell high quality natural and organic foods. We research ingredients and audit sourcing practices for Whole Foods Private Brand products to make shopping easier for customers. In our meat department, products are free of added hormones or antibiotics, and no cages or tethers are permitted during the animal\\'s daily life. Our seafood department sources only from responsibly managed fish farms and fisheries. The Whole Trade Guarantee found on produce and other items signifies that a product meets criteria that support both workers and the environment.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n39\\n\\x0cPalm Oil\\nPalm oil is used extensively as an ingredient in consumer products. However, its cultivation has contributed to deforestation, biodiversity loss, and negative social impacts in some of the regions where it is grown. Our approach is to promote the use of sustainably-certified palm oil in our Private Brand food products and ask our Private Brand suppliers to source palm oil that is sustainably-certified. We are starting with Amazon-owned Private Brand food products in North America and across Europe, where our goal is to source 100% sustainable palm oil by the end of 2020.\\nChemicals\\nWe are committed to developing high-quality and affordable Amazon-owned Private Brand products that customers love. Part of our commitment to quality is avoiding chemicals of concern in our products that can affect human health and/or the environment. We define chemicals of concern as those chemicals that: (1) meet the criteria for classification as a carcinogen, mutagen, or reproductive or other systemic toxicant; or (2) are persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic. We strategically prioritize which chemicals of concern to focus on based on product type, customer concerns, and the availability of safer alternatives.\\nThe baseline list of chemicals of concern included on our first Restricted Substance List (RSL) identifies the chemicals that we seek to avoid in Amazon-owned Private Brand baby, household cleaning, personal care, and beauty products in the U.S. and Europe. This policy is in addition to applicable local legal requirements and associated compliance plans. It will be expanded to additional brands, product categories, and geographies over time. Read more about our chemicals policy. amzn.to/materials\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n40\\n\\x0cFashion and Apparel\\nAt Amazon, we\\'re committed to making it easier for our customers to choose highquality, sustainable apparel products. We are working to lower the environmental impact of our Amazon-owned Private Brand apparel products and we partner directly with suppliers of these products to find solutions that promote the use of sustainably-produced fabrics and recycled materials. We are starting our work in the U.S. and Europe, and will expand to additional geographies over time. To incorporate industry best practices and support collective action, we are proud to collaborate with leading apparel partners, including the Better Cotton Initiative, Textile Exchange, Sustainable Apparel Coalition, and Leather Working Group.\\nCotton: We are working to ensure that all cotton used in Amazon-owned Private Brand apparel products is sourced sustainably by the end of 2022. This includes cotton sourced from recycled materials, or from farms certified as organic or licensed by the Better Cotton Initiative, a global nonprofit that aims to transform the cotton supply chain by developing Better Cotton as a sustainable mainstream commodity.\\nIn 2019, Amazon signed the Responsible Sourcing Network\\'s public Cotton Pledge, committing to not source cotton from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan until the pervasive use of government-mandated forced labor is stopped. Amazon prohibits forced labor within our supply chains, and we have internal controls and external engagements to address forced labor within global supply chains. This pledge represents an additional step in that direction and lends Amazon\\'s voice in demanding an end to forced labor in these two countries.\\nCellulosic fibers: By 2022, we will ensure that none of the man-made cellulosic fibers--including rayon/viscose, lyocell, and modal--sourced for Amazon-owned Private Brand apparel products are derived from ancient and endangered forests, or from endangered species\\' habitats or other controversial sources, as defined by the nonprofit organization Canopy\\'s tools and reports. Our approach to cellulosics includes using fabrics that provide assurance on traceability and use best available processing technology, as well as supporting the use of innovative lower impact alternative fiber sources, such as recycled fiber from used clothing.\\nRecycled fabrics: We will increase the use of recycled fabrics in Amazon-owned Private Brand apparel products, including moving from conventional to recycled polyester, and launching products made from innovative recycled fibers. In 2020, we joined the Textile Exchange, a global nonprofit that works with its members to drive industry transformation in preferred fibers, including recycled materials.\\nLeather: In 2020, we joined the Leather Working Group, a nonprofit membership organization that works to improve environmental stewardship within the global leather industry. By the end of 2023, we will source all leather used in Amazonowned Private Brand apparel and shoe products from tanneries that meet the Leather Working Group\\'s bronze level award or higher.\\nProduct labels: As of 2020, all new woven labels in Amazon-owned Private Brand apparel products are made from recycled fabric and all new swing tags are made from FSC-certified paper.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n41\\n\\x0cDevices and Sustainability\\nAmazon aims to be Earth\\'s most customer-centric company, which means as part of Amazon\\'s commitment to The Climate Pledge, we are working to make Amazon devices more sustainable, from how we make them to how customers use them. We complete life cycle assessments to help us understand the environmental impact of each device type and use these learnings to set goals, from using recycled materials to investing in renewable energy. We are building a future in which customers will be able to control their smart homes or read, listen, and watch on their devices, knowing that Amazon is reducing its carbon footprint.\\n\\nRecycled Materials\\nWe are incorporating recycled plastics, fabrics, and metals into many new Amazon devices, giving new life to materials that could otherwise end up in waste streams. The recycled materials used in our devices launching in 2020 could fill over 800 garbage trucks worth of plastics, fabrics, and aluminum.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n42\\n\\x0cDevice Packaging\\nWhen it comes to sustainability, we are not just focused on improving our devices, but on their packaging too. We are working to source 100% of the wood fiber in this packaging from responsibly managed forests or recycled sources. We\\'re reducing single-use plastic, eliminating over 9 million bags from our device packaging in 2020 alone. Our goal is to make Amazon devices packaging 100% curbside recyclable and plastic-free by 2023. We are also redesigning the shipping package to reduce waste.\\nEnergy\\nWe strive to make our devices energy efficient because it\\'s good for the planet and our customers. That\\'s why we\\'ve added a Low Power Mode feature to select devices that reduces their energy consumption during periods of inactivity over their lifetime. Making our devices more energy efficient is not enough to get to net zero carbon. So, starting in 2020, Amazon is building new wind and solar farms to produce clean energy equivalent to the electricity used by every customer\\'s Echo device. We have a bold goal to continue building new renewable energy projects until we account for the energy consumption of all Amazon devices.\\nInvesting in Clean Energy\\nAmazon works with energy companies to bring new renewable projects online to produce clean energy equivalent to the electricity used by our devices. To size these projects, we model and measure the energy consumed by our devices in different types of use, then project their total average global annual electricity consumption. The first new wind and solar farms are expected to come online in 2022 and 2023, and will produce clean energy equivalent to the electricity used by every customer\\'s Echo device. Until then, we will invest in renewable energy certificates to support clean energy projects, matching the quantity of electricity our customers\\' Echo devices use until the new projects come online. Our Amazon renewable energy portfolio is global, and in the coming years we will expand our devices renewable energy portfolio into other regions where our devices are used.\\nAlexa\\nCustomers can track and manage the energy consumed by compatible devices in their homes with an energy dashboard, coming soon to the Alexa app. Plus, if Alexa has a Hunch that a customer is away and forgot to turn off a light, Alexa will automatically turn it off -- helping customers conserve energy without even thinking about it. Collectively, this can help save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\\nTrade In or Recycle\\nWe build our devices to last, but there may come a time when customers want to trade in or recycle their device. Customers in the U.S. can explore their options with Amazon Second Chance. Eligible devices qualify for an Amazon.com Gift Card equal to the value of the trade-in, plus a discount toward the purchase of a new eligible Amazon device. For devices that are not eligible for trade-in, we offer customers a recycling program for electronic items including Amazon devices and accessories.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n43\\n\\x0cThe Cloud\\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is committed to running our business in the most\\nenvironmentally friendly way possible and achieving 100% renewable energy usage for our\\nglobal infrastructure.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n44\\n\\x0cLearn how AWS is working to achieve Amazon\\'s goal of 100% renewable energy.\\n\\nJAN 2016\\n\\nAPR 2015\\n\\nAmazon announces joining the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) and will participate in the U.S. Partnership for Renewable Energy Finance (U.S. PREF) to increase our work with state and federal policymakers and other stakeholders to enable more renewable energy opportunities for cloud providers.\\n2014\\n\\nNOV 2015\\n\\nJUL 2015\\n\\nAWS announces that it has contracted with Iberdrola Renewables, LLC to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm U.S. East.\\nAWS announces that it has contracted with EDP Renewables to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm U.S. Central.\\n\\nJUN 2016\\n\\nAmazon launches Wind Farm Fowler Ridge, marking the first of our four announced renewable energy projects to move into full operation.\\n\\nAWS and Dominion Virginia Power join forces on a landmark renewable energy delivery deal.

All rights reserved.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n47\\n\\x0cReducing Water in AWS Data Centers\\nAWS has always focused on efficiency and continuous innovation in our data centers to improve operational excellence and reduce our impact on the environment. In addition to our efforts on energy efficiency and our goal to achieve 100% renewable energy for our global infrastructure, AWS has multiple initiatives to improve our water use efficiency and reduce the use of potable (drinking) water for cooling data centers.\\nAWS develops our water use strategy by evaluating climate patterns for each AWS Region, local water management and availability, and the opportunity to conserve drinking water sources. Taking a holistic approach, we assess both the water and energy usage of each potential cooling solution to select the most efficient method.\\nEvaporative Cooling\\nWhen possible, AWS incorporates direct evaporative technology for cooling our data centers, significantly reducing energy and water consumption. During cooler months, outside air is directly supplied to the data center without using any water. During the hottest months of the year, outside air is cooled through an evaporative process using water before being pushed into the server rooms, and we have optimized our cooling systems to use minimal water. AWS is constantly innovating the design of our cooling systems to further reduce water use, and we utilize real-time sensor data to adapt to changing weather conditions.\\nRecycled Water\\nAWS is expanding its use of non-potable water for cooling purposes to help conserve local drinking water sources. In Northern Virginia, AWS was the first data center operator to be approved to use recycled water with direct evaporative cooling technology. We partnered with Loudoun Water to demonstrate the benefits of recycled water for industrial cooling applications, and shared our operational best practices for utilizing recycled water in our data centers. In the AWS U.S. West (Oregon) Region, we have partnered with a local utility to use non-potable water for multiple data centers, and we are retrofitting AWS data centers in Northern California to use recycled water.\\nThe process for utilizing recycled water begins when wastewater from residential and industrial customers is treated at a local facility and redistributed through its own piping infrastructure. Recycled water has to meet stringent health standards and safe surface discharge standards.\\nAWS is working with local utilities to expand distribution infrastructure and drive faster implementation and adoption of recycled water for data center cooling applications, in order to reduce our usage of potable water.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n48\\n\\x0cOn-Site Water Treatment\\nAWS is implementing on-site modular water treatment systems in multiple regions. As water is cycled through evaporative cooling units, minerals build up as water evaporates, eventually reaching a level of concentration that requires replacement with fresh water. On-site water treatment allows us to remove scale-forming minerals and reuse water for more cycles. Increasing our \"cycles of concentration\" allows us to continue to reduce water intake for cooling our data centers.\\nWater Efficiency Metrics\\nIn the infrastructure regions where we use water for cooling, AWS has developed water efficiency metrics to determine and monitor optimal water use for each AWS Region, and we employ a data-driven approach to select the most effective water reduction technologies. Water metrics from each of our Regions help AWS evaluate technologies and understand the long-term impacts on our water usage, in order to increase efficiency as our infrastructure grows and we expand to new regions.\\nWe are partnering with utilities to connect directly to utility water meters, and we are also installing our own meters to track real-time water usage to provide consistent data for our operations and sustainability teams. By analyzing this data, AWS can identify opportunities to reduce water usage and rapidly make operational changes, rather than waiting for bills or usage reports.\\nAWS will continue to implement these strategies and test new technologies in order to reduce our water consumption and conserve potable water sources. Saving water is good for the environment and also benefits our customers as we increase our operational efficiency.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n49\\n\\x0cAmazon Sustainability Data Initiative\\nThe Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) seeks to accelerate sustainability research and innovation by minimizing the cost and time required to acquire and analyze large sustainability datasets.\\nASDI currently works with scientific organizations like NOAA, NASA, the UK Met Office and Government of Queensland to identify, host, and deploy key datasets on the AWS Cloud, including weather observations, weather forecasts, climate projection data, satellite imagery, hydrological data, air quality data, and ocean forecast data. These datasets are publicly available to anyone. In addition, ASDI provides cloud grants to those interested in exploring the use of AWS\\' technology and scalable infrastructure to solve big, long-term sustainability challenges with this data. The dual-pronged approach allows sustainability researchers to analyze massive amounts of data in mere minutes, regardless of where they are in the world or how much local storage space or computing capacity they can access.\\nInnovating for Sustainability in the Cloud\\nFrom university researchers to local governments, federal agencies to private startups, many organizations are leveraging ASDI to better understand the long-term opportunities to address big challenges like climate change. Below are some examples of how AWS customers are innovating and problem solving for sustainability.\\n Satellite imagery for five countries in Africa has been compiled in the African Regional Data Cube (managed by the UN Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data), a tool developed in the AWS Cloud that enables authorities in countries like Ghana, Sierra Leone and Senegal to monitor deforestation, illegal mining and manage coastal erosion.\\n In Virginia, flood-prone towns are using sensors to monitor water levels and upload them to the AWS cloud as part of the StormSense project. Local residents can ask Alexa about water levels in specific places or subscribe to an app with alerts on dangerous flooding. \"The only way you can scale this well is by being in the cloud,\" said Sridhar Katragadda, data officer for the City of Virginia Beach, which is participating in the project.\\n Projects like Temperate and CalAdapt are also providing cloud-based tools to help communities better understand and prepare for climate change. These projects leverage large datasets staged on AWS to evaluate future climate changes and how those changesmay impact people, assets, and operations.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n50\\n\\x0c The BlueDot Observatory is using open satellite Earth Observations on AWS to monitor closely at-risk inland water bodies. The tool hopes to raise awareness about the vulnerability of these water resources and to provide timely insights that inform water management efforts.\\n Some work that ASDI is enabling is more foundational and is expanding our knowledge and understanding of key processes. For example, a group of researchers at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the American Bird Conservancy published some exciting understandings about bird migration patterns based on NOAA\\'s NEXRAD weather data that is freely available on AWS.\\nASDI supports innovators and researchers with the data, tools, and technical expertise they need to move sustainability to the next level.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n51\\n\\x0cPeople\\n53 Human Rights 60 Employees 73 Supply Chain 85 Community\\n\\x0cHuman Rights\\nAmazon is committed to ensuring the people and communities that support our entire value chain are treated with fundamental dignity and respect, and we strive to ensure the products and services we provide are produced in a way that respects\\ninternationally recognized human rights.\\n!\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n53\\n\\x0cOur Approach to Human Rights\\nOur approach is informed by international standards: we respect and support the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Core Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.\\nOur human rights strategy has four pillars:\\n1 Strong Policies\\nOur efforts are anchored in policies that apply across all aspects of our business--from our own operations, to our supply chain, to the communities in which we operate. In 2019, we codified our commitment to human rights in Amazon\\'s Global Human Rights Principles, which underline the importance we place on embedding respect for human rights throughout our business.\\n Human Rights Principles From the associates in our fulfillment centers, to the drivers delivering packages to our customers, to the factory workers making the products we sell--people are critical to our mission of being earth\\'s most customer-centric company. These values have been long-held at Amazon and codifying them into a set of Human Rights Principles demonstrates our support for fundamental human rights and the dignity of workers everywhere we operate around the world.\\n Supply Chain Standards We set a high bar for ourselves and our suppliers. Our Supply Chain Standards detail the requirements and expectations for suppliers in our supply chain and are grounded in principles of inclusivity, continuous improvement, and supply chain accountability. We engage with suppliers that are committed to these same principles; suppliers commit to these standards as a condition of doing business with us.\\nWe are committed to consistently evolving and improving our approach. We continuously review our policies and, at least every other year, conduct an in-depth benchmarking of our policies against international standards and evolving industry best practices to identify areas for update and improvement.\\n2 Embedding Human Rights Into Our Business\\nIn order to prevent and mitigate adverse impacts in the long run, we are committed to embedding human rights considerations into decision-making across the company and into our policy and governance framework. This governance starts with the Amazon Board of Directors, which appoints committees for oversight on specific issues. Among other duties, its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees Amazon\\'s global environmental, corporate social responsibility, and corporate governance policies and initiatives, and its Leadership Development and Compensation Committee oversees Amazon\\'s global human capital management strategies and policies.\\nWe are also building an employee training and engagement program to raise awareness of important human rights topics across the company. For example, in 2019, we launched training on human trafficking and forced labor for employees in our logistics network--educating our employees on how to recognize the warning signs of this criminal behavior.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n54\\n\\x0cHuman Trafficking Awareness\\nAmazon does not tolerate the use of child labor, forced labor, or human trafficking in any form--including slave labor, prison labor, indentured servitude, or bonded labor--in our operations or value chain. We have detailed the components of this commitment to combating human trafficking (also referred to as \"modern slavery\") in our annual Modern Slavery Statement, our Supply Chain Standards, and our Global Human Rights Principles.\\nWe\\'re raising awareness through employee training and partnerships. As a global retail and technology company employing hundreds of thousands of workers around the world, we recognize the responsibility and opportunity we have to raise awareness among our employees through education and training on relevant human rights and social responsibility issues. In 2019, we launched a human trafficking awareness program for employees around the world. In the program\\'s first phase, we trained fulfillment network managers in our UK operations. In 2020, we expanded this training to teach employees across our entire global fulfillment network to recognize signs of modern slavery using localized scenarios.\\nThe training focuses on raising awareness and teaching employees how to identify indicators of modern slavery and report concerns to appropriate authorities in a way that puts the interests of victims first. To develop the training, we relied on input from organizations with expertise in modern slavery, including Verit, a recognized leader in global labor protections, and incorporated videos and materials from the Gangmasters and Labor Abuse Authority (GLAA), a UK public agency focused on investigating labor exploitation. In 2020, we expanded our English training module to cover more languages and are developing region-specific training for our global employees. Our global security operations team has immediate response protocols in the event of a suspected human trafficking related issue, regardless of where the issue arises.\\nIn October 2019, we became an official corporate sponsor of Truckers Against Trafficking (TAT), an organization dedicated to combating human trafficking in the trucking industry, and began incorporating TAT training modules into trainings for our internal fleet of drivers to teach them how to identify and respond to potential victims of human trafficking. Our goal is to train 100% of our internal fleet of drivers on the Truckers Against Trafficking curriculum by the end of 2020.\\nOur social responsibility team regularly reviews and updates Amazon\\'s approach to human trafficking prevention and updates executive leadership on our progress throughout the year.\\n\\n3 Transparency and Stakeholder Engagement\\nWe are committed to driving industry-wide best practices in human rights due diligence through increased disclosures about our approach and expanding our stakeholder engagement.\\nIn 2019, we published our first interactive supplier map that provides details on suppliers of Amazon-branded apparel, consumer electronics, and home goods products. We expanded the map in 2020 to include additional suppliers and product categories, and to include information on capacity building programs completed by individual suppliers. In 2020, we disclosed additional information about our supplier assessment process and audit results, about our approach to worker engagement, and about the goals we have set for ourselves on such topics as forced labor training and women\\'s empowerment. To continue to expand our disclosures and transparency on these issues, we report against the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights Reporting Framework.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n55\\n\\x0cEngagement with external stakeholders is key to our human rights due diligence approach. We rely on experts and affected rights holders to inform our approach and ensure our efforts have the intended impact. In the last year, we have built new relationships with: the Better Buying Initiative to promote improved purchasing practices, Nest to improve conditions in the handworker economy, the Amader Kotha Worker Helpline to provide access to grievance for workers in the Bangladesh garment sector, Truckers Against Trafficking to train our drivers on how to identify victims of human trafficking, and Unseen to support the UK Modern Slavery Helpline and Resource Centre. Through these partnerships we access invaluable expert input to our work, helping us achieve greater impact on working conditions around the world.\\n4 Mechanisms to Address Risk\\nWe are committed to identifying, preventing, and mitigating adverse human rights impacts, and are continuously working to improve our approach.\\nIn our supply chain, we assess and respond to risk by leveraging internal and external data, and guidance from external stakeholders including industry experts, civil society groups, and non-governmental organizations. We use independent auditors to verify compliance with our Supply Chain Standards though regular on-site inspections and confidential worker interviews. We also recognize that audits alone are insufficient to drive long-term change across industries. We are exploring new ways to encourage improvement in worker protections, including supplier capacity building programs, worker trainings, and collaborations with other brands and civil society.\\nWithin our own operations, we have teams dedicated to assessing and addressing risk to our employees. Those teams focus on employee engagement--establishing open communication with our employees around the world and providing them with meaningful grievance mechanisms and avenues for dialogue with leadership. We are dedicated to building a diverse and inclusive workplace, where every employee feels comfortable sharing their unique perspectives and is supported in growing their career. And, we are obsessed with keeping our employees safe while on the job. We are working relentlessly to innovate and create new industry benchmarks for health and safety.\\nWe know we have more to do--we are committed to continuously widening our lens to better understand the potential human rights impacts of our business. In 2020, we are partnering with sustainability and human rights consulting firm Article One Advisors to identify salient human rights risks across our business. The UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework recommends this systematic review of risks as a way to prioritize a company\\'s work on human rights. The results will help us prioritize and design human rights impact assessments--deep dives on specific products, regions, or risk areas, which we will communicate to customers and stakeholders.\\nOUR GOALS: Launch a review of Amazon\\'s salient human rights risks by the end of 2020. Execute our first human rights impact assessment by the end of 2020.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n56\\n\\x0cAmazon Global Human Rights Principles\\nWe are committed to ensuring the people, workers, and communities that support our entire value chain are treated with fundamental dignity and respect. We strive to ensure that the products and services we provide are produced in a way that respects human rights.\\nWhile it is the duty of governments to protect human rights, Amazon recognizes our responsibility to respect and uphold internationally recognized human rights through the ethical treatment of our workforce and those within our value chain. Guided by the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we commit to embedding respect for human rights throughout our business. We continuously evaluate our operations and value chain to identify, assess, and address salient human rights risks; engage key stakeholders; and prioritize key areas where we have the greatest opportunity to have a positive impact on workers and communities. Our approach on human rights is informed by international standards; we respect and support the Core Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\\nWe are committed to investing in our employees, the workers who make our products, and the communities in which we operate. These principles outline our approach to human rights across all aspects of our company.\\nOur Workplace\\nWe endeavor to provide safe, inclusive, and respectful workplaces, in both our own operations and those throughout our value chain.\\nSafe and Healthy Workplaces: We strive to be the most safety-centric organization in the world. We provide a clean, safe, and healthy work environment. The health, wellness, and safety of our workers is our number one priority. Everyone has the right to a safe and healthy workplace with appropriate rules and practices for reporting and preventing accidents, injuries, and unsafe conditions, procedures, or behaviors.\\nDiversity and Inclusion: We are committed to diversity and inclusion throughout our business. We seek individuals from all backgrounds to join our teams, and we encourage people to bring their authentic, original, and best selves to work.\\nEqual Opportunity: We are committed to ensuring that all workers are treated equally, and we do not tolerate discrimination based on race, color, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, creed, the presence of any physical, sensory, or mental disabilities, age, political ideology, pregnancy, citizenship, migrant status, veteran status, ethnicity, ancestry, caste, marital or family status, or other legally protected status in hiring and working practices, such as job applications, promotions, job assignments, training, wages, benefits, and termination. Our aim is to ensure employment decisions and actions are based only on business-\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n57\\n\\x0crelated considerations--focused solely on an individual\\'s ability to perform the work, not their personal characteristics. As outlined in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, we do not tolerate discrimination, violent and threatening behavior, or harassment.\\nFreely Chosen Employment: We do not tolerate the use of child labor, forced labor, or human trafficking in any form--including slave labor, prison labor, indentured servitude, or bonded labor--in our operations or value chain.\\nEmployee Communication: We value worker feedback. We firmly believe it is in our employees\\' and the company\\'s best interests to continue our direct communications, and the best way to effect positive change is for our employees to continue working directly with their managers throughout the company. We respect freedom of association and our employees\\' right to join, form, or not to join a labor union or other lawful organization of their own selection, without fear of reprisal, intimidation, or harassment. We provide training to employees on topics covered within the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, including how to submit anonymous complaints to Amazon\\'s third-party Ethics Hotline. We are committed to providing our employees with appropriate access to grievance mechanisms and remedial action.\\nOur Suppliers\\nWe promote safe, inclusive, and respectful workplaces with our third-party suppliers and service providers. We seek suppliers committed to these same principles. Amazon\\'s Supply Chain Standards set forth requirements governing labor standards and working conditions. We implement this commitment through dedicated programs that communicate our expectations to the third-parties we work with, monitor working conditions where Amazon-branded products are made or services provided, implement plans to address issues and make improvements where necessary, and engage with stakeholders working to address specific and systemic issues.\\nHow We Do This\\nIntegration Throughout our Business: We expect and encourage everyone in our business to embed these principles into their everyday work and provide employee training to raise awareness on them. We strive to evaluate and understand the impact of each part of our business on human rights, to address and mitigate negative impacts, and to invest in the people behind the products and services we provide.\\nContinuous Improvement: To ensure we are continuing to hold the highest standards, we continuously review our policies and practices to ensure alignment with these principles and regularly provide updates on progress to senior leadership.\\nCollaboration: In support of these efforts, we value ongoing collaboration with a broad range of stakeholders, helping us remain vigilant and aware of the potential impacts--both positive and negative--of our products and services on the rights, interests, and well-being of our employees, customers, and communities around the world.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n58\\n\\x0cOur Business\\nAmazon seeks to be Earth\\'s most customer-centric company. We are passionate builders guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. We bring these principles to everything we do, including how we approach human rights.\\nOur Operations: Amazon believes the people, workers, and communities who support our business should be treated with fundamental dignity and respect. As of July 2020, we employed approximately 876,800 full-time and part-time workers across the globe. We manage our operations, including the people working in them, in three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Our online and physical stores enable hundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties. We source, manufacture, sell, and deliver millions of products to consumers.\\nOur Products: Amazon Consumer Private Brands and Amazon Devices offer our customers products spanning diverse categories including apparel, food and beverage, electronics, and home goods. Amazon\\'s suppliers are located around the world and produce, manufacture, assemble, or provide goods or services that are sold and delivered to Amazon.\\nThird-Party Sellers: Third parties sell products directly to customers on Amazon.com spanning broad product categories. These orders are either fulfilled by Amazon using our operations or shipped directly by the seller to the customer.\\nFulfillment and Logistics: More than 250,000 full-time associates support our global network of fulfillment centers. Amazon Fulfillment is where our employees, technology, and innovation come together every day to deliver for our customers. Fulfillment facilities run multiple shifts per day, and employees perform a number of roles--from leading teams to boxing up orders and shipping directly to our customers. We fulfill customer orders in a number of ways using our transportation supply chain. We operate North America and International fulfillment and delivery networks and have co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries. We also provide digital delivery and offer products in our physical stores as well.\\nAWS: AWS offers over 175 fully featured services from data centers globally. Ours is the largest global infrastructure footprint of any provider, and this footprint is constantly increasing. AWS teams around the world are building the future. Our people solve a wide variety of technical challenges, always focusing on the customer. Millions of customers-- including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies--trust AWS to power their technology infrastructure. aws.amazon.com\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n59\\n\\x0cEmployees\\nFrom our software engineers, to the associates in our fulfillment centers, to the drivers delivering packages\\nto our customers--our employees are critical to our mission of being Earth\\'s most customer-centric\\ncompany. Our ranks are full of smart, passionate people who are building new products and services\\nevery day on behalf of our customers.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n60\\n\\x0cWorkplace Health and Safety\\nSafety is a top priority throughout our fulfillment operations and on the roads in communities where we operate. Our vision is to synthesize leading health and safety expertise with Amazon\\'s tech capabilities and relentless innovation to create new industry benchmarks for the health and safety of our employees. Leaders in our facilities set the example for the highest safety standards.\\nFrom coaching and ergonomic training to ensuring processes and equipment in work areas are safely operated, leaders proactively verify and validate that safety protocols are followed. The industry-leading safety technology we use every day is designed to protect and promote our employees\\' health, and we consistently test and refine processes to improve working conditions in our facilities.\\nAbove all, safety at Amazon is about our people and partners. In 2019, we provided more than one million hours of safety training to employees. To make it all happen, we employ one of the largest health and safety organizations on the planet, with approximately 5,000 people worldwide focused on safety. Safety, however, is the responsibility of each and every person working at Amazon. In Amazon\\'s dynamic, positive safety culture, every team is engaged and encouraged to look out for one another.\\nSome of Amazon\\'s recent investments and technologies that support employees and make our workplaces safer include:\\nSafety Leadership Index (SLI): Amazon employees across the world are routinely surveyed through our innovative Connections program. Employees are asked the same series of questions each month, and those answers are used to measure employees\\' perception of safety at each of our facilities. An example of the kinds of questions which are asked include, \"Does your manager care about the safety of you and your team?\" Amazon employees have provided thousands of safety ideas, concerns, and suggestions since the program started, and Amazon has implemented more than 600 changes as a result of these responses. Last year, thanks to SLI feedback, we made personal safety equipment more easily available through free vending machines placed in fulfillment centers in several U.S. locations. Thanks to this improvement, employees can now get new equipment any time they want, which enhances safety for everyone.\\nWorkingWell: Over the past two years, we\\'ve developed WorkingWell, a program that uses academic research and certified athletic trainers to educate employees and leaders about health and wellness. WorkingWell is a training and conditioning program designed for new hires and tenured employees, which includes a new hire ramp-up schedule aimed at preventing musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). It also includes a two-week classroom course about proper body movements, health, and wellness, as well as routine safety training engagements.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n61\\n\\x0cMind and Body Moments: Piloted in 2019, this new program employs 30-second, guided physical and mental exercises, offered directly at an employee\\'s workstation. The intent of these \"moments\" is to help reduce muscle fatigue and stress, thereby promoting wellness and mitigating injury risks. Employees at pilot sites have reported statistically significant reductions in discomfort. We\\'ve seen a nearly 13% improvement in employees who report no discomfort at all during their workday. We will continue to evaluate expansion of this program to other site types and countries, targeting the rest of North American and European facilities with expanded language offerings.\\nSafety Capital Investments: Our facilities are purposefully designed to incorporate innovative technologies that enhance safety and improve efficiency. We don\\'t stop there. In 2020, we are making a substantial investment in the safety of our people and facilities, with $296 million earmarked for safety-related programs in the U.S. alone. As examples of past investments, in 2019, we invested $14 million to further improve the safety of employee parking lots at our facilities; $9 million to retrofit pallet racking with state-of-the art equipment; and $1.6 million on pedestrian safety controls in some of our specialized distribution centers.\\nPowered Industrial Truck Technology: Powered Industrial Trucks (PIT) are an important part of any warehousing operation. Our goal of eliminating PIT incidents can only be met if we take a leadership role in innovating in this industry and developing technologies not currently available in the market. We are partnering with vendors and investing $66.5 million to pilot PIT units that incorporate real time location systems (RTLS) and light detection and ranging technology (LiDAR). Additionally, we are augmenting telemetry controls on PITs we already own, which allows us to better monitor and control speeds in congested areas, implement access control, and ensure only certified operators are able to activate PITs.\\nRobotic Tech Vest: Several reports of near misses at our robotic sites, involving objects inadvertently falling into the path of drive units, led us to invest $9.8 million into engineering controls that could significantly reduce these types of risk. These controls were implemented before any human injury occurred, which speaks to how seriously we take near misses and how we\\'re constantly looking to improve safety. One example of such investment is the Robotic Tech Vests worn by employees at Amazon Robotics facilities, which allow robotic drive units to detect employees and plan alternative travel paths to avoid interactions.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n62\\n\\x0cInvestments in Our Employees\\nWe know that a strong culture and active investment in our people allows us to attract the diverse, innovative employees we need to understand and exceed our customers\\' expectations today and into the future. We are committed to providing the support, benefits, and opportunities our employees need to be successful, whether they are building their careers at Amazon or building skills with us to help them on their career journey.\\n876,800 full-time and part-time employees globally as of July 2020.\\n$15 per hour minimum wage for 100% of full-time, part-time, and temporary U.S. employees\\nComprehensive benefits from day one for 100% of full-time employees.\\nUp to 20 weeks paid parental leave.\\n24-hour a day free confidential counseling services.\\nOver 90% of Amazon regular full-time and part-time employees in the U.S. are eligible for healthcare benefits.\\nMore than 30,000 veterans and military spouses employed by the company, surpassing our goal of 25,000 by 2021.\\nUpskilling 2025 commitment: a $700 million commitment to pilot, launch, and scale training programs for 100,000 Amazonians by 2025.\\nOver the last decade, no other U.S.-based company has created more jobs than Amazon. Our investments have led to the creation of over 2 million direct and indirect jobs in the U.S. alone.\\nFor example, in the U.S., Amazon\\'s minimum wage begins at $15 an hour (in the UK at 9.50 GBP per hour and in Canada at 16 CAD per hour) for all full-time, part-time, temporary (including those hired by agencies), and seasonal employees. In addition to our $15 minimum wage, we offer full-time employees industry-leading benefits starting on their first day of employment with Amazon. These include: comprehensive healthcare coverage with affordable premiums (paycheck contributions) that extend to eligible family members, including medical, prescription drug, dental, and vision coverage; a 401(k) with a 50% match up to 4% of compensation; a Flexible Spending Account for health and dependent care; 24-hour a day free and confidential counseling services; and paid time off and holiday overtime pay. In 2020, Amazon is collaborating with Crossover Health to establish convenient health centers in the communities where our fulfillment centers and operations facilities are located, starting in Texas, with additional centers planned for other states in the months ahead.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n63\\n\\x0cWe are proud to offer generous, flexible paid leave for all parents--from our most senior executives to our hourly employees, including parents of all genders and adoptive parents. Birth mothers get up to 20 weeks of paid leave and non-birth parents have access to six weeks paid leave. We also offer Leave Share--an innovative program that allows Amazonians to share their parental leave with a partner whose employer does not provide paid parental leave. Additionally, Ramp Back enables employees to return to work on a flexible schedule for up to eight weeks after birth or adoption. Where possible we provide unlimited gender transition benefits, including gender affirmation. We have internal resources to help managers and team members support employees who are going through a gender transition.\\nFor employees reaching their one-year employment mark, we offer our innovative Career Choice Program, which prepays 95% of tuition for courses in high-demand fields. Since the program\\'s launch eight years ago, more than 40,000 employees in 14 countries have pursued degrees in five broad fields of study: IT, Healthcare, Advanced Manufacturing and Skilled Trades, Administration and Business Services, and Transportation. We are also now offering graduate-school-level training for our employees through Machine Learning University, a program designed to give current Amazon employees the chance to develop expertise in machine learning, critical skills in an area of rapidly growing professional opportunities within and outside of Amazon.\\n\\nAdditional employee benefits include:\\n\\nA free employee assistance program, which provides confidential 24/7 support, resources, and referrals for different aspects of work and personal life.\\n\\nOnline resources for parents whose children experience developmental disabilities, as well as help finding child and elder care referrals and assistance.\\n\\nFinancial counseling, estate planning, and other services in the event of a lifethreatening illness or death.\\n\\nAdoption assistance for qualified domestic and international adoption expenses including attorney fees, court costs, and travel.\\n\\nCompany-paid basic life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, with the option to enroll in additional coverage for dependents.\\n\\nAdoption benefits, including reimbursement for parents of up to $5,000 per child associated with the domestic or international adoption of a child.\\n\\nFertility treatment coverage.\\n\\nCompany-paid short-term and long-term disability.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n64\\n\\x0cDiversity and Inclusion\\nOur customers represent diversity in many forms--and we serve them better with a diverse and inclusive team. Our diverse perspectives help us push each other to think bigger, and differently, about the products and services we build for our customers and the day-to-day nature of our workplace.\\nWe want our employees and the communities we operate in to embrace that we are all human, we are all different, and we are all equal. Coming into work, every Amazonian should feel comfortable sharing their unique perspectives and seeking out the perspectives of others--this is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and constantly earn others\\' trust.\\nOur Workforce Data\\n\\nData reflects metrics as of December 31, 2019. Among Amazon\\'s global employees, 42.7% identify as women and 57.3% identify as men. Among managers globally, 27.5% identify as women and 72.5% identify as men. In the U.S., 15.4% of Amazon employees identify as Asian, 26.5% as Black/African American, 18.5% as Hispanic/Latinx, 1.3% as Native American, 3.6% as two or more races, and 34.7% as White. Among managers in the U.S., 20.8% identify as Asian, 8.3% as Black/African American, 8.1% as Hispanic/Latinx, 0.6% as Native American, 3.0% as two or more races, and 59.3% as White.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n65\\n\\x0cGender Pay Gap A review of the compensation awarded in 2019 at Amazon, including both base and stock, shows that women earned 99.3 cents for every dollar that men earned performing the same jobs, and minorities earned 99.1 cents for every dollar that white employees earned performing these same jobs. We continue to prioritize pay equity.\\nDiversity\\nWe recognize we have room for improvement and we are not yet where we need to be. Increasing diversity in our workforce is a collective challenge that requires a team effort; it calls for both near- and long-term strategies:\\nBuilding an Inclusive Culture To better understand what inclusion means for our employees, we conducted a global internal survey which led to Amazon\\'s definition of inclusion: \"Being valued, trusted, connected, and informed so that we can deliver the best results for our customers.\" We use this definition to guide us as we create educational initiatives, continually improve our mentorship program, and deliver benefits for all of our employees. Amazon has 12 affinity groups created and led by employees-- comprised of over 50,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally--who passionately and positively impact our company, each with an executive sponsor that ensures these groups are engaging at every level of the company. Groups such as Amazon People with Disabilities, Amazon Women in Engineering, the Black Employees Network, and Glamazon (for LGBTQIA+ employees and their allies) lead in community-building, mentorship, and programs to build awareness around customer inclusion. We engage and consult their leaders and seek their ideas to improve our inclusion efforts internally and externally. Our efforts have received external recognition: we are proud to have been recognized on the NAACP Equity, Inclusion, and Empowerment Index and the Disability Equality Index.\\nDeveloping the Pipeline and Hiring the Best Talent We recognize there is a diversity problem in tech. We are investing in solving this in our own company as well as building out the next generation of technical talent for the industry and expanding the opportunities for students from underrepresented backgrounds. Our efforts focus on two goals. First, contribute to changing the talent pipeline long-term. Last year we announced Amazon Future Engineer, a childhood to career program that will inspire and teach more than 10 million underprivileged and underrepresented students each year about computer science. And in 2017, we committed $50 million over five years to STEM programs for diverse communities. Second, we want to immediately accelerate this change. To find the best talent now for technical and non-technical roles, we actively partner with organizations and academic institutions that reach underrepresented communities like Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), and women\\'s colleges. In addition, we\\'ve created nontraditional learning pathways, like the Amazon Veteran Technical Apprenticeship, which places transitioning members of the military into apprenticeships at Amazon with the intent to later hire them with the technical skills needed for a fulltime role.\\nObsessing Over Customer Inclusion Amazon\\'s focus on accessibility has made shopping and other daily experiences simpler for people with disabilities. From voice technology to Frustration-Free Packaging, Amazon\\'s customer obsession for accessibility was recognized with the 2019 American Foundation for the Blind Helen Keller Achievement Award.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n66\\n\\x0cRacial Justice and Equity The inequitable and brutal treatment of Black and African Americans is unacceptable. Black lives matter and Amazon stands in solidarity with our Black employees, customers, and partners. We are committed to helping build a country and a world where everyone can live with dignity and free from fear. We support the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. We also support policies that protect and expand voting rights, as well as initiatives that provide better health and educational outcomes for Black people. As a part of that effort, Amazon and our employees--through a donation match program--were able to donate more than $27 million to organizations working to bring about social justice and improve the lives of Black and African Americans. Recipients--selected with the help of Amazon\\'s Black Employee Network (BEN)--include groups focused on combating systemic racism through the legal system as well as those dedicated to expanding educational and economic opportunities for Black communities. BEN will also receive a grant to fund local organizations that support education and racial equity initiatives in communities across the country where our employees live and work. We plan to continue building our relationships with these organizations and supporting movements for racial equity around the world. Amazon is committed to being part of the strategies, solutions, and partnerships that will enable long-term, sustainable change.\\nLGBTQIA+ Rights The rights of LGBTQIA+ people must be protected. We were early and strong supporters of marriage equality and will continue to advocate for protections and equal rights for transgender people. We stand together with the LGBTQIA+ community and are working at the U.S. federal and state levels on legislation, including supporting passage of the Equality Act. Amazon provides gender transition benefits based on the Standards of Care published by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). Amazon has held gender identity conferences since 2018 to build community, educate to those outside of the LGBTQIA+ community, and provide professional development opportunities for those at Amazon while transitioning openly in the workplace. In 2017, Amazon released our Transgender Toolkit for Trans/NB identifying employees at Amazon and we provide trans-inclusive medical benefits for Amazon employees. We are proud to have our efforts recognized, scoring 100% on the Human Rights Campaign\\'s Corporate Equality Index for LGBTQIA+ rights for the last three years.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n67\\n\\x0cDiversity Conferences\\nBuilding on our Leadership Principle of Learn and Be Curious, we organize conferences every year where employees can learn and exchange their ideas and experiences, several focused specifically on diversity issues:\\nAmazeCon is our largest internal conference at Amazon and has highlighted the benefits of gender diversity since 2015. At AmazeCon, Amazonians examine the intersection of gender with race, sexual orientation, disability status, veteran status, and other dimensions of diversity. This conference has included talks from external leaders in technology, entrepreneurship, entertainment, and leadership. It also includes Amazon-specific programs focused on personal and team development.\\nAmazeWIT is a conference we host in India bringing together women technologists, including Amazon\\'s technical leaders and external guests. The day-long event focuses on technology deep dives (including voice technology, machine learning, Fire OS, and others) and leadership discussions from senior Amazonians and peer companies.\\nConversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) is our internal conference that explores how race impacts our daily lives. Launched in 2018, the conference leads Amazonians through content on historical context, productive conversations, being an ally, and customer inclusion. At CORE, external scholars, activists, and writers dive deep on topics to educate Amazonians from all backgrounds on the experiences people of color have in the workplace, and how to create supportive and inclusive teams.\\nGlobal Accessibility Awareness Month has been recognized each May at Amazon since 2015. Around the world, the month is full of events, technical talks, experiential trainings, podcasts, and workshops that showcase accessibility best practices. Amazonians take time throughout the month to learn about accessibility, even if it is not a part of their day-to-day work. In 2018, participants attended events across 13 locations in six countries. In 2018, Amazon also hosted the first A11yCon, a conference focused on increasing visibility and awareness to accessibility challenges. The conference also included a multi-location accessibility hackathon focused on finding solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing people with disabilities in today\\'s technology-focused world.\\nLearn more about our efforts to promote diversity and inclusion at Amazon.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n68\\n\\x0cEmployee Engagement\\nOur more than 870,000 employees globally are the foundation of our success as a company. Consistent, honest, and open communication with our employees allows individuals to raise concerns and have them directly addressed by leadership; it allows us to continuously improve our workplace and employee experience. Our goal is to hear from and listen to everyone. Here are some of the many ways an employee can choose to communicate with management:\\n\\nOpen Door Philosophy We believe candid and constructive communication in an environment of mutual respect is essential to our collective success. We have an \"open door\" policy, which means we welcome and encourage any employee to discuss suggestions, concerns, or feedback with their manager, a Human Resources team member, or any member of Amazon\\'s leadership team.\\nVoice of the Associate Boards Voice of the Associate boards are in Amazon fulfillment centers around the globe--physically and virtually--providing employees a forum for expressing their concerns, offering suggestions, and asking questions on a daily basis to leadership. Leadership teams reply directly to questions, promoting dialogue and efficient remediation of issues. In 2019, our fulfillment center managers received and responded to over 225,000 comments, questions, and issues raised on the Voice of the Associates boards.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n69\\n\\x0cConnections Connections is a real-time, company-wide employee feedback mechanism designed to listen to and learn from employees at scale to improve the employee experience. Each day, Connections questions are delivered to every Amazon employee on a computer, a workstation device, or hand scanner. Employees may choose to answer or not answer any question, and individual responses are aggregated and shared with managers at the team level to maintain confidentiality. Connections analyzes response data and provides insights to managers and leaders to review and take actions as they uncover issues or see opportunities to improve.\\n Connections generates over 500,000 responses from employees daily.  Connections is live in 51 countries, at over 2,500 unique sites/locations, and questions are delivered in\\n21 languages.\\nExecutive Escalations Suggestions or complaints sent to a member of the senior leadership team are considered \"Executive Escalations.\" Any employee can utilize this method of providing a suggestion or raising a concern to leadership. All escalations are independently reviewed by Human Resources, used as a learning opportunity, and may be used to update our processes to prevent gaps in the future.\\nAppeals Process In the U.S. and Canada, the Appeals Process is a dispute resolution mechanism for employees in our in-scope lines of business (such as customer service, customer fulfillment, and sort centers) to challenge certain disciplinary actions. A second level manager, General Manager, or a panel of peers may review the issues raised in an appeal, including management decisions, to determine if a policy or practice was applied properly and consistently. If not, we will remediate the issue in line with our policies and practices.\\nEthics Hotline Employees may raise questions or report suspected violations of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics through Amazon\\'s Ethics Line in over 20 languages. Calls to the Ethics Line are answered by an independent third party and may be made anonymously upon request. Our Business Conduct and Ethics team records, reviews, and investigates calls for potential violations of the Code and tracks cases through to remediation where necessary. Allegations of violations of the Code are also reported up to the Audit Committee.\\nAssociate Insight Surveys and Pulse Surveys Annual surveys ask employees to anonymously express opinions about issues in the workplace, and managers respond by remediating issues or making improvements.\\nRegular In-Person Meetings Through all-hands meetings with General Managers, stand-up meetings with direct supervisors, and regular roundtables with senior leadership, employees have daily opportunities to engage with leaders, raise issues, and make suggestions to continually improve our workplace.\\nFreedom of Association We respect freedom of association and our employees\\' right to join, form, or not to join a labor union or other lawful organization of their own selection, without fear of reprisal, intimidation, or harassment. These rights should be exercised in an informed and thoughtful manner. Amazon has associates represented by some form of collective bargaining in many countries. We value worker feedback, and are committed to providing our employees with appropriate access to grievance mechanisms and remedial action, regardless of collective bargaining presence. We firmly believe it is in our employees\\' and the company\\'s best interests to continue our direct communications, and the best way to effect positive change is for our employees and us to continue working together directly.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n70\\n\\x0cSustainability Ambassadors\\nAt Amazon locations around the world, more than 4,500 employees join together as Sustainability Ambassadors--a grassroots organization of Amazonians working to expand the efforts of the global teams that work directly on managing Amazon\\'s environmental and social impacts. The Sustainability Ambassadors program started in 2017 with chapters in corporate offices and fulfillment centers in the U.S. and Europe. The program continues to expand, now with over 160 teams around the world.\\nRecognizing that global challenges require global participation, Sustainability Ambassadors seek opportunities to lead and collaborate, using their collective action to amplify and deliver on Amazon\\'s ambitious sustainability goals. Ambassadors raise awareness of sustainability as a practice for all Amazonians by delivering environmental education through on-site events. They lead projects and pilot initiatives within buildings and across communities, striving to make Amazon the most sustainable place to work.\\nExamples of initiatives include: diverting products from waste into donations for people in need; developing innovations in recycling programs to include new products and locations; setting up local commute options like carpool programs and bike to work challenges; conducting energy audits with local utilities and implementing new energy efficiency programs; organizing community cleanup events at local beaches, parks, and wetlands; and developing services aimed at helping customers meet their own sustainability goals.\\nAmbassadors based in our fulfillment centers and operations facilities focus on sustainability projects that help sites deliver on their carbon reduction goals. The program provides a community platform to share best practices and scale sustainability across our worldwide networks. In Poland, one Ambassador team collectively redesigned the waste segregation process in their fulfillment center, driving waste recycling rates up by over 40%.\\nAmbassadors in our corporate offices have a unique opportunity to launch ideas with data-driven analysis using Amazon technology. For example, after auditing waste at our global headquarters in Seattle, Ambassadors developed a proposal to improve waste sorting using DeepLens--a deep learning enabled video camera from Amazon Web Services. A team of Amazon employees built a dataset and model that used DeepLens\\' object detection capabilities to identify the waste items being discarded and use built-in audio to tell people which bin to use for a given item.\\nThe combination of ground-level action with scalable ideas and advanced technology makes Sustainability Ambassadors critical partners in achieving Amazon\\'s larger sustainability goals.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n71\\n\\x0cCOVID-19\\nFrom the beginning of the pandemic, we have worked tirelessly to support and protect our employees, customers, and the communities we operate in during this time of crisis. Our top concern is ensuring the health and safety of our employees, and we expect to invest approximately $4 billion on COVID-related initiatives getting products to customers and keeping employees safe.\\nWe\\'ve made over 150 process updates--from enhanced cleaning and social distancing measures to new efforts like aerosol disinfectant spraying. We\\'re spending over $85 million redeploying team members, including some of our most talented software engineers, moving them from their typical roles onto teams where they can work on cutting-edge safety programs. We distribute personal protective equipment to our employees and require them to use face coverings while at work. We introduced and scaled temperature checks across our worldwide facilities. As of May 2020, we have:\\nProvided 100 million+ masks to our fulfillment center and office sites. Added 2,298 handwashing stations. Added 5,765+ janitorial staffers to our typical teams. Provided an additional 34 million gloves. Added 48 million ounces of hand sanitizer. Purchased 31,000+ thermometers and 1,115+ thermal cameras. Worked on building scalable testing for coronavirus.\\nWe\\'re continuing to innovate and find new ways to support the health and safety of our employees. One of the most promising opportunities we\\'ve discovered to improve workplace safety comes from artificial intelligence and machine learning. We are now using computer vision technologies in our buildings to help site leaders identify high traffic areas and implement additional measures to improve social distancing. This program, which we call \"Distant Assistant,\" provides immediate feedback to our employees on whether they are maintaining six-feet of physical distance from one another. As people walk past the camera, a monitor displays live video with visual overlays. Individuals remaining six feet apart are highlighted with green circles, while those who are closer together are highlighted with red circles. The on-screen indicators are designed to remind and encourage employees to maintain appropriate distance from others. We are excited to open source the software and AI behind this innovation so that anyone can create their own Distance Assistant. Individuals and businesses large and small can download the package at no cost and get up and running with just a computer and camera.\\nOur colleagues are on the front lines, helping customers in communities around the world in a way very few can--delivering critical supplies directly to the doorsteps of people who need them, particularly the elderly and those with underlying health issues. Here are some of the things we are doing to support our employees:\\n We gave our employees a special one-time Thank You bonus totaling over $500 million. All front-line employees and partners who were with the company throughout the month of June 2020 will receive a bonus.\\n If one of our employees is diagnosed with COVID-19, they will receive up to two weeks of paid time off. This time off is in addition to their other paid and unpaid time off options.\\n We established a $25 million relief fund for partners (e.g., delivery drivers) and seasonal employees facing financial hardship or quarantine.\\nLearn more about how we are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic on our Day One blog.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n72\\n\\x0cSupply Chain\\nAmazon is strongly committed to conducting our business in a lawful and ethical manner, including engaging with suppliers who respect\\nhuman rights, provide safe and inclusive workplaces, and promote a sustainable future.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n73\\n\\x0cAbout Our Supply Chain\\nOur mission is for our products to be made in a way that respects human rights and the environment. Our global teams work closely with suppliers to communicate our standards, and help suppliers build their capacity to provide working environments that are safe and respectful of human rights.\\nOur Approach to Responsible Sourcing Our standards are derived from the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Core Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. To ensure our policies and programs incorporate these internationally recognized human rights standards, we conduct formal benchmarking with industry peers and multi-stakeholder organizations to continually improve our program. We regularly review our Supply Chain Standards against policies developed by industry associations (such as the Responsible Business Alliance and the Consumer Goods Forum) in consultation with external stakeholders including Nest, Business for Social Responsibility, Impactt Limited, and Verit.\\nOur Sourcing Footprint Hundreds of thousands of workers, employed by suppliers around the globe, make our Amazon-branded products. The suppliers that produce Amazon-branded apparel, consumer electronics, food and beverage, and home goods products are shown on our supply chain map, which is updated regularly and is available to download. We believe supply chain transparency is crucial to our approach to human rights due diligence and ensuring worker protections. We publish our supplier list to provide customers and external stakeholders visibility into where we source and to contribute to transparency efforts across industries. When we receive information about potential issues in our supply chain we investigate and take appropriate action to remediate.\\nAssessment of Risk We routinely evaluate our supply chain to understand the highest risks to workers and prioritize our efforts. To do this, we engage key internal and external stakeholders, analyze our risks using international risk indices such as the World Bank\\'s Worldwide Governance Indicators, run worker surveys, and conduct assessments that include worker interviews, management interviews, document review, and on-site visits. We regularly consult industry experts to review our approach to risk assessment against globally recognized international standards and industry best practices.\\nSupplier Assessments Our Responsible Sourcing Program focuses on suppliers of Amazon-branded products, consisting of Amazon Private Brands and Devices and a curated selection of brands exclusively sold on Amazon. Through this program, we engage in robust supplier due diligence, prioritizing mechanisms that drive continuous improvement. We are committed to working with our suppliers to remedy issues and establish systems to prevent future issues. We expect our suppliers to consistently monitor and enforce our standards in their own operations and supply chain as well as make improvements to meet or exceed our expectations. We use independent auditors to verify supplier compliance with our standards though regular on-site inspections and confidential worker interviews.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n74\\n\\x0cIn 2019, we conducted a total of 4,082 assessments to help us determine which suppliers to work with and, for those we do engage, to help us continually understand and improve those suppliers\\' practices. We utilize three types of assessments:\\nPre-Production Assessments Suppliers must submit an Amazon-approved assessment of their facilities before beginning production of Amazonbranded products.\\n 44% of assessments conducted in 2019 were Pre-Production Assessments.\\nOngoing Assessments Suppliers must submit Amazon-approved assessments on an ongoing basis while producing Amazon products.\\n 35% of assessments conducted in 2019 were Ongoing Assessments of active suppliers.\\nVerification Assessments Where issues are identified, suppliers must develop a corrective action plan detailing actions to address identified issues, a long-term plan to prevent reoccurrence, and where necessary, undergo a follow-up assessment to ensure issues are properly remediated.\\n 21% of assessments conducted in 2019 were Verification Assessments to verify remediation.\\nOur approach is based on a commitment to workers and to continuous improvement; we put the safety and interests of workers first. Suppliers are required to meaningfully participate in any investigation and take immediate action in the event that issues are found. An acceptable corrective action plan details the root cause of the issue and the steps, both short- and long-term, that supplier management will take to fix it. In most situations, we will support suppliers through the remediation process, but where a supplier refuses to remediate, we may choose to terminate the relationship. Failure to meet our standards has been a factor in our decision to terminate hundreds of suppliers.\\nSupply Chain Standards and Supplier Manual\\nOur mission is for our products to be made in a way that respects human rights and the environment. Our global teams work closely with suppliers to communicate our standards and help suppliers build their capacity to provide safe and respectful working environments.\\nSupply Chain Standards We set a high bar for ourselves and our suppliers. Our Supply Chain Standards detail the requirements and expectations for suppliers, vendors, and service providers throughout our supply chain, and suppliers must commit to these standards as a condition of doing business with us.\\nSupplier Manual Our Supplier Manual provides guidance and resources to suppliers of Amazon-branded products on how to meet and exceed the expectations outlined in our Supply Chain Standards.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n75\\n\\x0cSupplier submits\\nAmazon-approved audit of facility\\n\\n    Key Stages of Supplier Assessment and Issue Remediation:\\n\\nIf issues are identified, Amazon will issue a request for\\na Corrective Action Plan\\n\\nRemediation of identified issues is tracked through follow-on verification audits\\n\\nOnce in production, supplier is audited on an\\nongoing basis\\n\\nIf supplier refuses to remediate an issue, Amazon may choose to\\nterminate relationship\\n\\nAbout Our Assessment Results: Suppliers are assessed across four main categories: 1) Labor, 2) Health and Safety, 3) Environment, and 4) Ethics. These categories are divided into subcategories, such as non-discrimination, emergency preparedness, hazardous substances, and transparency. Findings within each subcategory are flagged as High, Medium, or Low depending on the level of severity.\\nOver the last three years, Amazon has focused on setting a high bar for new suppliers and refusing to go to production until suppliers remediate all High level findings identified in our assessments. Since 2017, the proportion of audits with High and Medium level findings on Labor and Health and Safety has decreased (Labor decreased by 15.7 percentage points and Health and Safety decreased by 8.8 percentage points).\\nWe recognize that some issues may take time to effectively remediate. For Medium level issues, we expect suppliers to show they are making meaningful progress toward remediation within a defined timeline. For Low level issues, we monitor suppliers for continuous improvement. We have dedicated teams based in key sourcing countries around the globe that work directly with our suppliers to identify solutions to challenging problems and promote open dialogue. We seek to create long-term relationships with suppliers who align with our values and who are committed to constantly improving conditions for workers. Where we see trends in issues beyond individual suppliers, such as widespread health and safety deficits or industry-wide failures to responsibly protect migrant workers, we work to define regional or global strategies to address underlying systemic challenges.\\nThe most common High and Medium level finding in 2019 was the Wages and Benefits subcategory. Examples of findings in this subcategory are: failure to pay overtime at the appropriate overtime rate, wage payments were delayed, or required government deductions have not been properly paid. The second most common finding in 2019 was Emergency Preparedness and Response--for example, a malfunctioning fire detection system or a blocked emergency exit. We are committed to driving improvement in these areas.\\n\\nOur Supply Chain\\n\\nAcross the Globe\\n\\n14%\\n\\n1% 1%\\n2% 2% 2% 2%\\n5%\\n\\n40%\\n\\n15%\\n\\n16%\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n76\\n\\x0cProgress in 2019\\nBeyond individual supplier improvements, in 2019, we invested in programs to address complex regional and systemic issues identified through assessment data, risk assessments, or by external stakeholders:\\n\\nAddressing Wages and Benefits: Compliance with our standards on wages and benefits persists as a common issue across suppliers in our Responsible Sourcing Program, as evidenced by the frequency of this finding among our suppliers. In 2019, we updated our Supply Chain Standards to include language encouraging suppliers to pay a fair wage and announced that worker wages is one of our key commitments areas as a program. In 2020 and 2021, we will dive deeper in to the root causes of this issue and the actions that Amazon and our suppliers need to take to reduce future findings on wages.\\nWomen\\'s Empowerment: Women have the power to be agents of change in workplaces and society. Ensuring women workers in our supply chain have the resources and information to make choices on their health, their safety, and their finances empowers them to overcome structural and societal disadvantages and improves outcomes for all workers. We have committed to investing in women\\'s empowerment and, in 2019, we began a partnership with the BSR HERproject, an initiative that brings together global brands, their suppliers, and local partners to create and implement workplace-based interventions on health, financial inclusion, and gender equality. Through our partnership with HERproject, we engage with suppliers in China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and India. As of June 2020, we reached over 8,700 women, building the capacity of workers and factory management to combat gender-based discrimination in the workplace.\\nEmphasis on Supplier Transparency: Supplier transparency issues were one of our most common High and Medium severity findings in both 2017 and 2018. Over the last year, we focused on increasing our communication with suppliers through pre-assessment outreach and on-site engagements to explain our standards and expectations of suppliers. We also improved our supplier-facing materials--including publication of a Supplier Manual--detailing our process and the importance of transparency. Building on our leadership principle of Earns Trust, we seek to build solid, trusting relationships with our suppliers over time that lead to better sharing of information.\\n\\nIncreased Investment in Health and Safety Programs: Health and Safety subcategories continue to be one of our most common assessment findings, particularly Emergency Preparedness and Response and Industrial Hygiene. In 2019, we began working with the International Labor Organization\\'s SCORE Program, a lean manufacturing program focused on improving productivity and working conditions in small- and medium-sized manufacturers. We enrolled suppliers in India and China to improve supplier management systems and their ability to effectively and efficiently meet health and safety standards. The program offers training and assistance in implementing improvement plans across five areas: workplace cooperation, health and safety, quality management, clean production, and human resources. In 2020, we will continue to enroll additional suppliers and develop a monitoring and evaluation mechanism for measuring impact on health and safety performance.\\nResponsible Recruitment: Forced labor is a complex and often hidden crime. Suppliers frequently lack basic awareness of the risks inherent in worker-paid recruitment fees or the importance of a process for responsibly managing migrant worker recruitment. Our standards require suppliers to reimburse in full any fees paid during the recruitment process. We are working to educate our suppliers on the issue, helping them develop the appropriate management systems, and ultimately minimizing the risks of forced labor. In 2020, we developed a Responsible Recruitment Guidebook in collaboration with labor rights nonprofit Verit. This guide provides suppliers with practical strategies to prevent forced labor risks and remediate worker-paid recruitment fees. In 2020, we will launch in-person trainings on responsible recruitment for our suppliers in Malaysia, Taiwan, and Japan. We are also working with the Responsible Labor Initiative to advance industry-wide approaches to ensuring responsible recruitment.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n77\\n\\x0cCASE STUDY\\nEnhancing Worker Safety and Well-Being in the Bangladesh Garment Industry\\nHealth and safety in Bangladesh factories persists as an issue, particularly in the garment industry. In 2019, we learned that products sold by third-party selling partners in the Amazon Store were potentially linked to factories with unsafe working conditions in Bangladesh. We took immediate action to remind selling partners that Amazon\\'s Supply Chain Standards apply to all products sold on Amazon and that under those standards, Amazon expects all products sold in the Amazon Store or provided to Amazon to be manufactured or produced in safe, healthy, and inclusive work environments.\\nWe issued new guidance specifically prohibiting the selling of products made in factories deemed ineligible under the Bangladesh Accord or Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which evaluates Bangladesh garment factories for workplace safety. We removed any products connected with such factories from our Amazon Store. We also notified selling partners that we will evaluate all credible allegations or reports of selling partner violations of our Supply Chain Standards, including but not limited to those published by governments, reputable investigators, journalists, or human rights defenders.\\nIn addition to engaging third-party selling partners at issue in the allegations, we went further to proactively engage all suppliers manufacturing Amazon-branded products in Bangladesh. We require verification of the safety of building structures and electrical and fire safety issues, and we conduct on-site inspections with certified engineers for the highest risk issues to track closure. We enhanced our pre-sourcing screening process for new Bangladesh suppliers to ensure that adequate building safety equipment and systems are in place as a pre-condition to being approved for Amazon production.\\nAs a way to further support workers in the Bangladesh garment industry, we also invested in the Amader Kotha Helpline which provides workers throughout the region, including many of Amazon\\'s own suppliers, with a grievance mechanism to report and quickly resolve factory concerns in the ready-made garment sector in Bangladesh.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n783\\n\\x0cThe following table includes data from our assessments in 2019, including suppliers not currently producing for Amazon.\\nHigh and Medium Level Findings by Subcategory in 2019 (% of all assessment findings)\\n\\nSubcategory Labor\\nFreedom of Association Freely Chosen Employment Humane Treatment Non-Discrimination Subcontractor and Next-Tier Supplier Responsibility Wages and Benefits Worker Grievance/Complaint Mechanism Working Hours Young Workers Ethical Behavior Business Integrity Transparency Environment Hazardous Substances Pollution Management and Prevention Health and Safety Emergency Preparedness and Response Industrial Hygiene Machine Safeguarding Sanitation, Dormitory, and Canteen\\n\\nHigh/Medium Severity\\n0.4% 3.2% 0.1% 0.4% 0.1% 40.7% 0.0% 7.9% 0.5%\\n2.3% 2.9%\\n0.0% 0.1%\\n10.5% 9.5% 0.1% 2.3%\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n79\\n\\x0cSupply Chain Commitments\\nWe evaluate our supply chain to identify the industries, countries, and issues where we have the greatest opportunities to identify and address risks and have a positive impact on workers. In the event we identify an issue in our supply chain, we act fast and prioritize solutions from the workers\\' point of view.\\nWe work with industry partners to tackle systemic issues and implement programs that support continuous improvement for our suppliers and workers. As a part of our due diligence efforts to identify, prevent, and mitigate adverse impacts, we leverage internal and external data and guidance from external stakeholders including industry experts, civil society groups, and non-governmental organizations.\\nWe are committed to assessing our impact and focusing our efforts in the following key commitment areas:\\nSafe Workplaces: Safe and healthy workplaces are a top priority for Amazon. We have global teams who partner with suppliers to increase worker awareness of safety issues, promote worker participation in their facility\\'s safety culture, and promote initiatives focused on the well-being of workers on issues that matter most to them.\\nOur suppliers must provide workers with a safe and healthy work environment; suppliers must, at a minimum, comply with applicable laws regarding working conditions. Additionally, we are committed to driving improvement in these key priority areas: (1) occupational safety, including adequate machine safeguarding, and ensuring suppliers continually identify, evaluate, and control physically demanding tasks to ensure that worker health and safety is not jeopardized; (2) emergency preparedness and response planning; and (3) sanitation and housing--if suppliers provide residential facilities for their workers, they must provide clean and safe accommodations.\\nWe conduct on-site assessments of Amazon-branded suppliers to determine safety conditions throughout our business relationship. This includes assessments of protections such as adequate fire safety systems, sanitary dormitories and facilities, and adequate machine safeguarding.\\nWe require that these suppliers address material safety issues prior to beginning production with Amazon. Assessment results are reviewed regularly by the leadership of our Amazon-branded businesses, and corrective action plans are implemented with suppliers as needed.\\nFreely Chosen Employment: We will not tolerate the use of forced labor in our supply chain. Our Supply Chain Standards prohibit all forms of forced labor and human trafficking; this includes charging workers recruitment fees, holding passports or personal documentation, and coercion to work through threats of deportation or contacting immigration authorities. During assessments of Amazon-branded suppliers, we track where workers migrated from and how much they paid in recruitment fees. If fees have been paid, we require the supplier to reimburse workers in full. Forced labor is a hidden crime that is hard to combat. We recognize real progress in this space will only be achieved through collaborative action--by companies, governments, and civil society--to spur system-wide change. Learn more about our approach to forced labor in our annual Modern Slavery Statement. Amazon is currently working with these organizations to devise holistic approaches to combating forced labor:\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n80\\n\\x0cPolaris: Amazon supports Polaris, a nonprofit that assists trafficking victims and survivors. Through the U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline, Polaris has identified and responded to over 63,000 cases of human trafficking and labor exploitation since 2007. AWS works with Polaris to infuse cutting-edge technology into its infrastructure to accelerate the development of the largest known U.S. data set on trafficking. Polaris uses that data to understand and improve the way trafficking is identified, how victims and survivors are assisted, and how to prevent this abuse.\\nResponsible Labor Initiative: The Responsible Labor Initiative is a multi-industry, multi-stakeholder initiative focused on ensuring that the rights of workers vulnerable to forced labor in global supply chains are consistently respected and promoted.\\nTech Against Trafficking: Tech Against Trafficking (TAT) is a coalition of technology companies collaborating with global experts to help eradicate human trafficking using technology.

Spotlight\\'s sophisticated machine learning capabilities save time for investigators by automatically flagging ads likely to represent at-risk children. Investigators can set customized alerts and search Spotlight\\'s constantly growing database of ads to aid in their investigations. Spotlight has helped identify more than 14,000 child sex trafficking victims.\\nUnseen: Amazon has made a three-year commitment to work with UK modern slavery helpline Unseen, investing in their efforts to provide immediate and long-term support to potential victims of modern slavery and to ensure the helpline\\'s continued growth. The helpline provides direct response and services to potential victims of modern slavery, as well as trainings and programming to support those victims.\\nOUR GOALS: 100% of Amazon employees who drive trucks complete Truckers Against Trafficking training by the end of 2020. Launch supplier improvement program focused on responsible recruitment by the end of 2020.\\nEmpowering Women: Quality jobs for women translate to positive impacts for communities, and we are actively working to empower women to make their own decisions on health, finances, and career development. This includes collaborating with globally recognized programs such as Better Work and Business for Social Responsibility\\'s HERproject. Through our partnership with HERproject, we engage suppliers in China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and India. As of June 2020, we had reached over 8,700 women with training on health and financial skills, building the capacity of workers and factory management to combat gender-based discrimination in the workplace.\\nOUR GOAL: Launch empowerment programs to reach over 25,000 women in our supply chain by 2023.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n81\\n\\x0cFair Wages: We are committed to working closely with suppliers, business partners, and multi-stakeholder associations to monitor and promote continuous improvement in working conditions, including fair and on-time payment of wages. We have dedicated teams across the globe that work directly with suppliers to track and report performance against these standards.\\nOur suppliers are required to pay legally required compensation (including overtime and benefits) and we encourage our suppliers to continuously evaluate whether workers earn enough to meet their basic needs and the needs of their family.\\nWe require Amazon-branded suppliers in a number of regions to enroll in Better Work--a partnership between the International Labor Organization and the International Finance Corporation focused on improving working conditions in the garment industry and making the sector more competitive. By working with suppliers and training workers on their rights, Better Work is able to help workers improve wages over time.\\nOUR GOAL: Launch in-depth research into fair wages within our Amazon-branded products supply chains in 2021.\\nEnvironmental Protection: Our aim is to ensure that the manufacturing of our products does not cause unnecessary environmental harm, and positively impacts people and communities. We are a member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (Coalition), an industry-wide group of leading apparel and footwear brands, retailers, manufacturers, non-governmental organizations, academic experts, and government organizations working to reduce the environmental and social impacts of apparel products around the world. We encourage our Amazon-branded suppliers to evaluate their practices using the Coalition\\'s Higg Index, a tool to help manufacturers measure the social and environmental performance of their facilities. We are committed to driving adoption of this assessment and helping our suppliers understand their environmental impact.\\nOUR GOAL: Collect environmental performance data from 200 suppliers by the end of 2021.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n82\\n\\x0cCOVID-19\\nAmazon is committed to supporting our suppliers, their workers, and their communities as they are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have dedicated over $1 million in initial investments to support response and recovery efforts in our supply chain.\\nWe are continuing to monitor suppliers for compliance with our Supply Chain Standards and are making necessary modifications to supplier assessment procedures based on internal and external stakeholder recommendations. We are working to balance the need to limit the movement of people and allow suppliers time to support workers and prepare production schedules with the need to have our eyes and ears on the ground.\\nWe have urged suppliers to take the following steps to mitigate risk to workers:\\nFollow all government safety recommendations before resuming or continuing to manufacture Amazon-branded products and take appropriate steps to ensure safe and clean workplaces.\\nAvoid ending worker contracts where workers are sick or caring for sick family members.\\nEnsure monitoring of worker hours and proper overtime notices as factories ramp up production.\\nWe are partnering with organizations providing critical support to suppliers and workers during this devastating pandemic:\\n In Bangladesh, we\\'ve partnered with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to distribute medical supplies and COVID-19 related resources for front-line doctors, nurses, and medical workers operating in the largest refugee camp in the world. The contribution supports the procurement of lifesaving PPE for 23 IOM-managed health facilities, serving to benefit both refugee and host community populations in the region.\\n Amazon is supporting the implementation of SCORE Training in 42 factories, which is helping factories plan their production schedule, reorganize production lines, and implement guidelines for more social distance and increased safety. Factories enrolled in the SCORE program receive support implementing health and safety protocols and providing workers with training on health and sanitation, which has improved the working conditions of 20,000 workers, including 9,000 women.\\n As part of our longstanding relationship with BSR\\'s HERproject, we helped to launch HERessentials, a new venture that will digitize HERproject\\'s and Empower@Work\\'s learning modules into a six-module Digital Worker and two-module Digital Manager Toolkit curriculum for remote access. The toolkit covers topics like personal hygiene, reproductive health and breastfeeding, and financial planning, and offers local resources on mental health and domestic violence services. The toolkit will be available to 500,000 female workers by 2025 in Bangladesh, China, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, and Vietnam, and will be translated into local languages.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n83\\n\\x0cCOVID-19\\n Amazon partnered with Nest, a nonprofit building a hand-worker economy of artisans, to increase global workforce inclusivity, improve women\\'s well-being, and preserve important cultural traditions around the world. As part of this partnership, we have been able to distribute over 100 economic relief grants to artisan businesses across the globe. We were also able to support the Nest\\'s PPE Purchasing initiative--a program that purchased over 200,000 protective masks to be delivered to front-line workers. This program distributed over $500,000 in economic relief value to 57 businesses, which altogether employed 10,510 skilled artisans.\\n We are supporting the Amader Kotha Helpline, which provides workers with a grievance mechanism to report and resolve factory concerns in the ready-made garment sector. Our contribution will help support the organization\\'s increased call volumes and the 24/7 factory grievance lines in regions impacted by COVID-19. The Helpline serves as a resource for 600+ factories, 30 of which are Amazon suppliers, reaching 1.5 million workers in Bangladesh, and supporting them in safely transitioning back into the workplace.\\n In India, we partnered with Swasti--a global nonprofit committed to ensuring access to quality healthcare for workers and those in marginalized communities--to adapt their worker well-being program (Invest4Wellness) to provide support to workers in factories impacted by COVID-19. With our support, Swasti is setting up a worker helpline, developing health protocols for workers to return to work safely, establishing an emergency response team, and providing critical mental health, healthcare, and social entitlement support to workers, their families, and their communities.

We use a structured lifecycle assessment model to measure and map climaterelated risks across our value chain. We also conduct regular materiality assessments to understand the most significant environmental, social, and governance topics across our business over the short, medium, and long term.\\nWe monitor risks and prioritize opportunities by taking into account customer and stakeholder expectations, voluntary practices and regulations, industry best practices, trends in financial and sustainability reporting, and emerging topics in news and social media.\\nSome of our current highest priority sustainability issues are:\\n Response to the COVID-19 crisis and support for our customers, employees, and communities  Climate change, energy efficiency, renewable energy, and sustainable transportation  Responsible supply chain practices, including human rights and the safety and well-being\\nof workers in our supply chain  Waste, recycling, and the circular economy  Sustainable products\\nAmazon uses a variety of mechanisms to embed sustainability across our business. We integrate sustainability practices into our everyday operations through goal-setting, metrics, and quarterly business reviews.\\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of Amazon\\'s Board of Directors oversees Amazon\\'s environmental, social, and corporate governance policies and initiatives, including our progress on The Climate Pledge and risks related to our operations, supply chain, and customer engagement. The Committee also oversees and monitors Amazon\\'s policies and initiatives relating to human rights and ethical business practices.\\nIn the area of climate change in particular, we are developing tools to identify and manage weather and climate-related risks across our business. The foundation of this work is the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI), a global and authoritative source for open-sourced weather, climate, and sustainability data. This data, together with AWS analytical tools, enables cutting-edge scientific work and helps us raise the bar for our customers.\\nFor example, by using the NOAA weather data available in ASDI, Amazon transportation teams have been able to better predict how weather-related events (snowstorms, floods, heatwaves, etc.) impact customer package deliveries--and we have provided customers with more accurate delivery estimates as a result. The AWS Infrastructure team also leverages weather data from ASDI to better assess the impact of weather on AWS data centers. Our ultimate goal is to enable customers and suppliers to use the tools we are developing in-house to improve climate resilience.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE\\n\\n91\\n\\x0cAmazon Sustainability Policy Positions\\nIncreasing the deployment of renewable energy resources is valuable for the planet, good for business, and important for our customers.

Helping the community provide healthier diets for kids can promote better food choices in future generations, the effects of which can last a lifetime.\\nUnitedHealth Group | Helping Build Healthier Communities\\n\\x0cDRIVEN BY OUR MISSION AND SUPPORTED BY OUR CORE VALUES, WE ARE HELPING BUILD HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES.\\n\\nThe people of UnitedHealth Group are driven by our mission to help people live healthier lives and to help make the health system work better for everyone. Our social responsibility and philanthropic efforts are aligned with our mission and values, supporting initiatives that combine our knowledge, experience and compassion -- as an enterprise and as individuals -- to improve health quality and outcomes in the communities where we live and work.\\nOur People and Our Partners\\nOur aspiration for higher-quality care for all and health care systems that serve more people with better care worldwide presents a huge opportunity. Our people demonstrate their conviction to helping build healthier communities by giving generously to charitable causes they care deeply about and volunteering their personal time, skills and energy to serve others. Through the power of collaboration and teamwork with partners who share our concerns and our desire to make life better for others we are making meaningful progress around the world.\\n\\nOur Company\\nUnitedHealth Group serves people through two distinct, complementary businesses:\\n\\nUnitedHealthcare (www.uhc.com) serves nearly 50 million people worldwide by offering medical benefits for individuals and students; employers of all sizes; and Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and retirees.\\n\\nOptum (www.optum.com) is a leading information and technology-enabled health services business that delivers intelligent, integrated solutions that help modernize the health system and improve overall population health.\\n\\nUnitedHealth Group | Helping Build Healthier Communities | 1\\n\\x0cOur People\\nUnitedHealth Group\\'s year-round giving program supports employees\\' desires and efforts to give back to the communities where they live and work, across the nation and around the world. Through charitable contributions and volunteering, our people are deeply and personally involved in improving the health and welfare of their neighbors.\\n\\nEmployee Giving & Volunteering\\nOur people generously contribute all year long to causes and organizations close to their hearts. The United Health Foundation, a not-for-profit, private foundation established by UnitedHealth Group and dedicated to improving health and health care, matches employee contributions, dollar for dollar, to nearly all nonprofit organizations, doubling the impact. Employees have the ability to give whenever, wherever and however they choose.\\nIn 2018, employee contributions combined with the United Health Foundation match totaled $55 million. Employees contributed to 23,000 charitable causes.\\nIn addition to financial support, our people give their time and talents to help build healthier communities. For example, employees recently provided flu shots for homeless individuals in Chile; filled backpacks with new school supplies and donated them to Flint, Michigan, area students; upgraded school fitness spaces in Los Angeles, Chicago and Hartford; and packed meals to fight hunger throughout the United States.\\n\\nUnitedHealthcare Children\\'s Foundation\\nSince 2007, the UnitedHealthcare Children\\'s Foundation (UHCCF) has offered medical grants that provide financial relief for families who have children with medical needs not covered, or not fully covered, by their commercial health insurance plan. Families do not need to have UnitedHealthcare insurance to be eligible.\\nThrough the generosity of more than 6,500 UnitedHealth Group employees, the United Health Foundation, other individuals and corporations, UHCCF celebrated a record year in 2018, awarding 3,242 medical grants. Over the last 11 years, the organization has awarded more than 18,600 grants valued at $45.1 million, and has impacted the lives of more than 80,000 individuals.

In 2018, they contributed 2.5 million volunteer hours to help others  1 million more hours than in 2017. Here are just two examples of the impact of their charitable initiatives:\\nThe Walk to End Alzheimer\\'s\\nTeam members from across UnitedHealth Group participated in the Walk to End Alzheimer\\'s to show their commitment to helping the millions of seniors who are affected by this devastating disease. More than 1,400 UnitedHealth Group employees took part in walks in 96 cities across the U.S., raising nearly $150,000 for Alzheimer\\'s care, support and research.\\n\\nHelp for Homeless Veterans\\nOptum and UnitedHealthcare team members joined forces to pack veteran care kits, containing hygiene and comfort items, and helped distribute them to homeless veterans through the American Red Cross\\' Service to the Armed Forces program. Teams collected soap, shampoo, conditioner, dental care products and more.\\nWith the outpouring of support from team members, UnitedHealthcare and Optum were able to assemble 500 care kits, double their goal of 250. The kits were distributed in Minnesota during a Stand Down event where supplies and services are provided to homeless veterans.\\nTo read more stories about how our employees support their local communities, visit:\\nwww.unitedhealthgroup.com/socialresponsibility\\n\\nOur People by the Numbers\\n\\nEmployee giving program contributions totaled\\n$55M\\nin 2018\\n\\nCharities supported worldwide through the giving program totaled\\n23,000\\n\\nEmployee volunteer hours donated in 2018 totaled\\n2.5M\\n\\nUnitedHealth Group | Helping Build Healthier Communities | 3\\n\\x0cOur Partners\\nThe power of partnerships and collaboration is key to building healthier communities. We partner with organizations committed to making health care better through innovation, local insight and perseverance in the face of tremendous challenges. Together, we\\'re discovering new insights into the health of our communities and helping to create the path to a healthier future. These partnerships focus on the following four areas: Connecting Individuals to Quality Care; Creating a 21st Century Health Workforce; Supporting Whole-Person Health; and Serving Distinct Populations.\\n\\nConnecting Individuals to Quality Care\\nCommunity Outreach Targets Oral Cancer in Kentucky\\n\\nKentucky has a growing problem with access to dental care and oral health services. According to the United Health Foundation\\'s 2018 America\\'s Health Rankings, the number of dentists per capita has declined for three straight years.\\n\\nA grant from the United Health Foundation is helping the University of Kentucky College of Dentistry launch a project to \"Eradicate Oral Cancer in Eastern Kentucky.\"\\n\\nKentucky also has one of the nation\\'s highest incidences of oral cancer, according to the National Institutes of Health, and the prevalence of oral cancer in Harlan, Letcher and Pike counties in eastern Kentucky is as much as 54 percent higher than the state average. Oral cancer has a high rate of mortality; only about 57 percent of people survive five years after diagnosis, due in large part to late discovery.\\n\\nA $1 million grant from the United Health Foundation is helping the University of Kentucky College of Dentistry (UKCD) launch its \"Eradicate Oral Cancer in Eastern Kentucky\" project, an integrated outreach and care program delivered to community residents through their local health departments.\\n\\nThe goal of the three-year project is to raise public awareness of the symptoms of oral cancer and its link to heavy alcohol and tobacco use, provide approximately 1,000 oral cancer screenings at local health departments and help connect patients who need additional care to cancer specialists.\\n\\nUKCD will share the findings from the \"Eradicate Oral Cancer in Eastern Kentucky\" project in presentations to state and national organizations, along with guidance on how the program could be replicated or adapted in other communities.\\n\\n4 | UnitedHealth Group | Helping Build Healthier Communities\\n\\x0cSupporting Whole-Person Health\\n\\nImproving Access to Mental Health Care for Children\\n\\nSuicide among children and teenagers in the U.S. is on the rise.\\n\\nMental health care, especially for children, is lagging behind\\n\\ndemand as clinicians struggle to address whole-person health\\n\\nfor all age groups. According to the United Health Foundation\\'s\\n\\n2018 America\\'s Health Rankings, Kentucky has seen a 25 percent\\n\\nincrease in teen suicides since 2016. Pathways, Inc., and the\\n\\nUnited Health Foundation recently announced a three-year,\\n\\n$930,000 grant to expand mental health services for young\\n\\npeople in eastern Kentucky, using telehealth technology to reach children in underserved rural areas.\\nSince 1967, Pathways has provided community-based mental\\n\\nKentucky Health and Family Services Cabinet Secretary Adam Meier joined the United Health Foundation and Pathways to announce an initiative to expand mental health services for children in eastern Kentucky using telehealth technology.\\n\\nhealth care across 10 counties in northeastern Kentucky. It is the\\n\\nonly agency in the region that employs psychiatrists for children and adolescents.\\n\\nThe United Health Foundation grant enables Pathways to provide better access to specialty mental health care for the 3,000 children it serves. Pathways will install and operate telehealth technology at its 16 outpatient offices and specialty residential units, eliminating the need for families to drive as long as two hours to access a mental health specialist.\\n\\n\"With the United Health Foundation as our partner, we will be able to provide life-changing services for children and families who need specialized mental health care,\" said Dr. Kimberly McClanahan, chief executive officer, Pathways. \"We will also be able to address the shortage of mental health care providers in rural Kentucky through our new telehealth technology.\"\\n\\nServing Distinct Populations\\n\\nInsight into the Health of Military Service Members\\n\\nIn October, the United Health Foundation released the 2018 America\\'s Health Rankings Health of Those Who Have Served Report. This report, created in partnership with the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA), is the only national resource to provide comprehensive population-based insights into the health of those who have served.\\n\\nThe United Health Foundation released the America\\'s Health Rankings Health of Those Who Have Served Report, a check-up on the health of individuals who have served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces.\\n\\nAmong the 2018 report\\'s key findings:  Those who have served are more likely than civilians to report\\nthat their health is very good or excellent.  Men and women who have served have higher rates of\\ndepression, anxiety and frequent mental distress than civilian men and women.\\n\\nThe report also documents some encouraging markers of preventive and primary care where those who have served fare better than their civilian counterparts.  Colorectal Cancer Screening: 72.4 percent vs. 66.0 percent  Dental Visit: 69.6 percent vs. 65.2 percent  Flu Vaccine: 50.6 percent vs. 37.0 percent  Unmet Medical Need Due to Cost: 8.7 percent vs. 14.1 percent\\n\\nIn total, this report features 31 health measures, including 10 new measures focused on mental health and opioid misuse. These new markers of health offer greater data-driven insights into the strengths and challenges associated with the health of these individuals. By providing new insights on opportunities to improve the health of those who have served, this report reflects the United Health Foundation\\'s commitment to supporting the health of military service members, veterans and their families.\\n\\nUnitedHealth Group | Helping Build Healthier Communities | 5\\n\\x0cCreating a 21st Century Health Workforce\\nEducating the Next Generation of Health Data Experts\\n\\nInvesting in tomorrow\\'s health care data scientists is vital\\n\\nto helping solve some of the health system\\'s toughest\\n\\nchallenges and creating the actionable insights needed\\n\\nto improve care quality and health outcomes.

To address this critical public health issue, the Greater Columbus Infant Mortality Task Force developed recommendations to reduce the community\\'s alarming infant mortality rate by 40 percent and cut the racial health disparity gap in half by 2020. CelebrateOne was created to train and deploy community health workers to help carry out the task force\\'s recommendations. One of these community health workers is Vanitia Turner.\\nVanitia Turner (pictured above, third from left), a mother to six children and grandmother to 16 grandchildren, was inspired to join CelebrateOne because she knew firsthand the painful reality of losing a child too soon. In 2011, Kendalyn Rose Gore, Vanitia\\'s granddaughter, died from sudden infant death syndrome while asleep at home.\\nVanitia is helping reduce infant mortality in Columbus by connecting Columbus area mothers to essential health and social services, including prenatal care and education, easy-to-use cribs, transportation and emergency food and housing. \"I don\\'t think any parent or grandparent should go through the death of a child when it\\'s preventable,\" says Vanitia. \"We want to see babies thrive in their first year and thereafter.\"\\n\\nCelebrateOne is charged with tackling the most significant factors that contribute to Columbus\\' high infant mortality rate:\\n Babies born too soon or too small;  Exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy and\\nsecondhand smoke in the early days of life;  Sleep-related deaths; and  Health inequities that lead to higher infant mortality\\nrates for black children.\\nCelebrateOne and Columbus Public Health set a goal of adding 72 new community health workers to conduct outreach to women of childbearing age in eight Columbus communities. These community health workers are trained to connect mothers and mothers-to-be with resources, programs and services  such as prenatal care and safe sleep practices  to help reduce infant mortality. The initiative was funded by a $1.7 million partnership grant from the United Health Foundation in 2016.\\nAs of November 2018, a total of 87 local residents have completed the community health worker certification program through The Ohio State University College of Nursing, surpassing the initial goal of 72. The community health workers have educated approximately 25,400 Columbus mothers and mothers-to-be.\\nTo read more stories about our partners, visit:\\nwww.unitedhealthgroup.com/socialresponsibility\\n\\nUnitedHealth Group | Helping Build Healthier Communities | 7\\n\\x0cEnvironment\\n\\nThe environment plays an important role in the health of every community.

Walmart Investors\\n3\\n\\x0cA message from our Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWhy are we doing this?\\nWhy are we launching big efforts like Project GigatonTM? Why did we set ambitious goals such as creating zero waste and using 100% renewable energy? Why, as a retailer, have a position on human rights? Why issue an Environmental, Social & Governance Report every year to track progress?\\nWell, as with many things at Walmart, the WHY of it starts with our founder, Sam Walton.\\nTwenty-seven years ago, President George H.W. Bush traveled to Bentonville to present Sam with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It was a pinnacle moment for Walmart, and our founder shared a few powerful and timeless thoughts. He provided a forward-looking purpose for our company that drives us today:\\n\"If we can, why, we\\'ll lower the cost of living for everyone -- not just in America, but we\\'ll give the world an opportunity to see what it\\'s like to save and have a better lifestyle and a better life for all.\"\\nSam said \"and.\" Our purpose is to help give people all over the world the opportunity to save \"... AND have a better lifestyle AND a better life for all.\" Some have described Sam as a merchant with a servant\\'s heart. During his life, he gave back to the communities where we had stores and, as the scale of the company has grown, our desire to strengthen communities and make a difference in the world continues on.\\n\\nSam made those comments in 1992. In 2005, our President and CEO Lee Scott painted a vision of \"21st Century Leadership\" and challenged us to expand our thinking and impact. He said, \"For us there is no distinction between being a responsible citizen and a successful business. They are one and the same for Walmart.\"\\nWhat Sam and Lee said applies now more than ever. We believe it\\'s important to run our business in a way that generates lasting value for our customers, our associates, our shareholders and for society more broadly.\\nTo many of us today, trust seems in short supply. Institutions, including business, especially big business, are being questioned. We see it in the headlines. We think that people want to trust again but, of course, trust has to be earned. People want to see companies doing good in the world, and people want to work for companies they believe in. Business should serve more than just one stakeholder group. It\\'s not enough to just serve shareholders or just serve customers; rather, the opportunity for businesses and their leadership is to add value for all stakeholders. We\\'ve felt that way for a long time and we\\'ve been taking action, but we\\'re challenging ourselves to make even better choices and do more.\\nWe\\'re investing in our associates through wages along with better educational opportunities, benefits and training. For example, since the first U.S. Walmart Academy opened in 2016, more than\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n4\\n\\x0c800,000 associates have gone through training. And we expanded our parental-leave and adoption policies and raised starting wages again. As of last year, a fulltime hourly associate in the U.S. who gives birth to a child is eligible for up to 16 weeks of paid time away.\\nWe\\'re launching new efforts to be more sustainable. Earlier this year, we announced a plan to reduce plastic waste in the packaging for our private brands. By 2025, we aim to use 100% recyclable, reusable, or industrially compostable packaging for our private brands in the U.S.\\nWe\\'re continuing our fight against hunger. Four years ago, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation committed to providing 4 billion meals through funding and food donations by 2020. We are ahead of schedule.\\n\\nAnd we\\'re working to source responsibly and improve supply chain conditions. For example, we\\'re proud to be a founding member in 2013 of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which concluded its commitment last year. Over the past five years, 90% of high-priority remediation items were complete across all factories affiliated with the Alliance and almost 1.6 million workers have been trained in fire safety. We continue to collaborate with stakeholders to improve the lives of workers in the global supply chain.\\nIn the end, we all must answer one simple question: What valuable purpose did we serve? Either as an individual or as a company, which is simply a collection of individuals, what good did we do for the world?\\n\\nWalmart is nearing the end of its sixth decade. We\\'ve been around a while, and with longevity comes a perspective and vision beyond next week. We\\'re in it for the long haul. And we understand that for a business to last, it must have a fundamental reason for being, which is found in the value it creates for all-- customers, associates, communities, shareholders, suppliers, future generations ... and the planet. Remember, Sam said \"and.\" This is the And.\\nDoug McMillon President and Chief Executive Officer Walmart Inc.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n5\\n\\x0cA message from our Chief Sustainability Officer\\n\\nBusiness exists to serve society.\\nFor Walmart, this is true in many ways: providing customers with convenient access to affordable food and other products; employing associates; helping suppliers grow their businesses that in turn employ others; generating tax dollars that help support community life; providing a return to shareholders.\\nThe most successful businesses do such things but go one step further -- they aim in the long term to improve the systems on which they rely, such as retail workforce development or food supply chains. Why? Not only to build customer trust, but also to enhance supply security, improve the quality of products and services, manage costs and expenses more effectively, generate new revenue streams, and attract and retain talent. Strengthening these systems is not only the responsible thing to do -- it maximizes business value.\\nBy many measures, there has never been a better time to be alive than today. Yet society faces many challenges. While global prosperity has increased, so has inequality; and studies point to a skills gap that needs to be addressed to help people advance economically, especially as evolving technologies change the nature of work. Meanwhile, increasing global demand is placing unsustainable pressure on\\n\\nthe climate and natural ecosystems, challenging us all to shift from a \"take-make-dispose\" system of production and consumption to a circular, regenerative approach.\\nThat\\'s why our approach to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues goes beyond minimizing our own footprint or mitigating risk. We take a more transformative approach: working to spark collective action in an effort to alter the sector in the long term for environmental, social and economic sustainability.\\nSo in the case of economic opportunity for retail associates, for example, we aim not only to help people enter the workforce with competitive wages, but also to help them build skills needed to advance, whether at Walmart or beyond. We want to build a skills-based employment system, with ladders of opportunity, at scale, that is inclusive and reflective of our communities.\\nAnd when it comes to human rights in supply chains, we aim not only to source responsibly, but also to work with others to rewire chains for social sustainability -- for example, improving Bangladesh factory safety through our work with the Alliance, or fighting modern slavery in seafood through our work with the Seafood Task Force and the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n6\\n\\x0cWith respect to climate change, we want to address our own operations while galvanizing collective action across the retail supply chain to bend the curve on emissions -- working with suppliers in an attempt to avoid a gigaton of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 through initiatives in energy, waste, agriculture, packaging, natural capital and product design.\\nIn this report, you will find a summary of our aspirational goals and recent progress related to our priority ESG issues. For example, since our last report, we conducted our first climate risk assessment and\\n\\nhave advanced toward our science-based targets for emissions reduction; we have launched new initiatives in waste reduction, particularly related to plastic. Inspired by the United Nations (U.N.) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we published our first human rights statement to make it easier to see how we respect human rights across our business. We continue to strengthen our retail associate proposition and make strides working with others toward the social and environmental sustainability of multiple supply chains.\\n\\nAs always, we welcome your feedback and your collective action in helping to transform retail systems for long-term environmental, social and economic sustainability.\\nKathleen McLaughlin Chief Sustainability Officer, Walmart Inc. and President, Walmart Foundation\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n7\\n\\x0cAbout this report\\n\\nWalmart has been reporting on a wide range of ESG topics since 2005.

This ESG Report responds to stakeholder requests for a more concise and focused view of our priority topics -- how we define them and the long-term strategy to manage them; our aspirational goals and targets; and progress to date. \"Walmart\" means Walmart Inc., a Delaware corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, excluding eCommerce subsidiaries, businesses, platforms and/or marketplaces, unless otherwise noted.\\n\\nWe provide additional information on a variety of ESG topics in the resources below:\\n\\nGlobal Ethics Human Rights Statement Global Responsibility website Walmart Sustainability Hub\\n\\nResponsible Sourcing Culture Diversity & Inclusion Report Corporate Policies Walmart.org\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n8\\n\\x0cForward-looking statement\\nThis report contains certain forward-looking statements based on Walmart management\\'s current assumptions and expectations, including statements regarding our sustainability targets, goals, commitments and programs and other business plans, initiatives and objectives.

For example, better ESG practices can enhance customer trust, catalyze new product lines, increase productivity, reduce costs and secure future supply, while simultaneously improving livelihoods, advancing economic mobility and opportunity, reducing emissions and waste, and restoring natural capital.\\nSalient issues\\nWe set ESG priorities based on relevance to our company purpose, key categories and markets; Walmart\\'s ability to create change; and relative importance to our customers and other stakeholders.\\n\\nWhole-systems change\\nTo maximize shared value, we aim not only to run a good retail business, but also to make largescale and lasting improvements to the ecosystems most salient to our business. Walmart has a unique ability to make a difference through our strengths, including our approximately 2.2 million associates around the world, supplier relationships, jobs, purchase orders and expertise.\\nBusiness leadership\\nWe drive and track performance against our social and environmental priorities through our everyday business activities. For example, we track performance toward our diversity goals through our human resources activities, and toward our aspirational renewable energy goals through real estate and operations activities. ESG initiatives are embedded throughout our company in our business planning and performance management cycle, operating policies, organization roles and coordinating mechanisms, project governance, and systems and tools (e.g., the Sustainability Index).\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n10\\n\\x0cAligned philanthropy\\nOur corporate giving and the Walmart Foundation\\'s programs complement our business initiatives by seeking to help accelerate social and environmental transformation. In FY2019, through a combination of in-kind and cash gifts, Walmart gave more than $1.4 billion to projects that create opportunity, enhance sustainability and strengthen communities.\\nCollective action\\nSince we believe that collective action is essential to transforming systems, we shape our ESG programs in collaboration with other leaders and stakeholders. Project Gigaton, the Retail Opportunity Network and the Sustainability Index are just a few examples of large-scale, system-wide collaborations we have helped create.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n11\\n\\x0cDefining our ESG priorities, goals & targets\\n\\nOur ESG priorities are grounded in our long-term business strategy and account for macro-economic, social and environmental trends. These priorities are where we see the most opportunity for shared value.\\nStakeholders provide valuable insight into our priorities. In 2014, we formally engaged stakeholders through our materiality review process. The results informed our 2025 commitments, where we committed to progress in topics such as associate opportunity, social challenges in supply chains, environmental sustainability, human rights and community resiliency.\\nMateriality, as used in the context of this report and our materiality review process, is different than the definition used in the context of filings with the SEC. Issues deemed material for purposes of this report, and for purposes of determining our ESG strategies, may not be considered material for SEC reporting purposes.\\nWe conduct regular updates through ongoing stakeholder engagement and dialogue. We address numerous ESG issues through our business, in partnership with others and through philanthropy, and we provide information on those throughout this report. Three issues that rise to the top of our priority list include: (1) economic opportunity for Walmart associates; (2) the safety and livelihoods of workers in supply chains; and (3) climate change.\\n\\nEconomic opportunity\\nWorkforce development is one of the biggest issues facing economies around the world, especially as technology accelerates the pace of change for the jobs of today and tomorrow.\\nBecause the retail industry provides a point of entry into the job market for millions of workers, it has the potential to act as a springboard for economic mobility if workers can gain the experience and skills required to advance.\\nOur workforce development approach focuses on access, stability and mobility. For example, Walmart U.S. provides an entry point into work for thousands of associates; competitive wages and strong benefits (from healthcare to retirement savings); and access to affordable education opportunities relevant for advancement in retail jobs. With the emergence of automation and artificial intelligence, our training and development programs become even more relevant for workforce success, as they help equip associates with critical 21st century skills.\\nAs described in more detail later in this report, our efforts are underpinned by a commitment to fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion throughout our company. By investing in a more diverse and dynamic workforce, we hope to keep pace with evolving customer demands, while also acting as a force for economic inclusion.\\nLearn more in the Retail opportunity section.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n12\\n\\x0cSocial issues in the supply chain\\nWith retail operations in 27 countries, Walmart\\'s supply chain includes more than 100,000 suppliers across the globe. Walmart respects human rights in the supply chain. Our Responsible Sourcing team, working with and through our suppliers, mitigates risks related to worker safety and well-being. We set expectations for our suppliers through our Standards for Suppliers and use audits to help assess whether our standards are being upheld. We also evaluate our global supply chain using internal and external data, risk assessments of particular regions, countries, commodities or products, and guidance from industry experts and non-governmental organizations.\\nRecognizing the need for whole-system transformation in a number of retail supply chains industry-wide, Walmart has committed to use our ability to bring together stakeholders including industries, civil society, governments and international organizations, to address the major potential risks to the dignity of workers in a minimum of 10 retail supply chains by 2025. Based on our analyses and where we believe Walmart can have the greatest impact, we\\'ve identified the following five supply chains:\\n Produce in the U.S. and Mexico\\n Shrimp in Thailand\\n Tuna processed in Thailand\\n Apparel in Bangladesh\\n Electronics sourced for the U.S. retail market supply chain\\nLearn more about our action in the Responsible supply chains section.\\n\\nClimate change\\nWe believe climate change is likely to affect national economies and supply chains around the world through potential effects such as lower crop yields, increased health costs and storm damage. According to The Sustainability Consortium, 60% of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide come from the global production and use of consumer goods. With operations and a value chain that span the globe, we aim to galvanize collective action to reduce emissions, while taking steps to strengthen the resilience of our business.\\nAccordingly, we have set a science-based target1 that covers our GHG emissions footprint: We aim to reduce emissions in our operations (Scopes 1 and 2) by 18% by 2025 from 2015 levels; and we are working with suppliers to reduce or avoid emissions in our supply chain by 1 gigaton by 2030 through an initiative known as Project Gigaton.\\nLearn more about our actions in the Climate change section.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n13\\n\\x0cChallenges to achieving aspirational goals, commitments & targets\\n\\nThe aspirational goals, commitments and targets we set under priority topics are designed to help Walmart aim high, hold ourselves accountable and move at an aggressive pace. Our public ESG commitments galvanize action across our business through seniorlevel oversight, policies and programs. We hold ourselves accountable through metrics, measurement and annual reporting, including the annual publication\\n\\nof our ESG Report. In 2016, our CEO Doug McMillon announced our 2025 commitments and targets. These are laid out in greater detail at the beginning of the Environmental and Social sections of this report.\\nESG issues are complex. We believe that setting goals and driving action toward meeting them is necessary to advance progress on many environmental and\\n\\nsocial issues facing society.

To avoid the worst effects of climate change, the Paris Agreement calls for collective action across society to limit global temperature increases to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius.\\nAt Walmart, we are focused on reducing emissions in our operations, engaging suppliers to reduce emissions in supply chains, strengthening the resilience of our business and using our voice to advocate for collective action.\\nClimate change impact scenario analysis\\nTo better understand the nature of climate change and potential implications for the retail sector, we conducted a climate scenario analysis, working with an independent third-party consultant; we aimed to align with the scenario guidance set forth by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\\nThe analysis considered two scenarios for global warming: 2 C (the upper end of the range targeted by the Paris Agreement) and 4 C (often called \"business as usual\"). Each scenario looked out to the years 2030 and 2050, making assumptions about four climate variables: temperature, drought/water stress, extreme weather events and sea level. The analysis modeled potential effects of these variables on aspects of retail business operations such as store heating and cooling requirements; crop yields (e.g., bananas, corn, lettuce, tomatoes, wheat, cotton); and storm\\n\\ndamage to stores and distribution centers. The analysis made many simplifying assumptions. For example, each variable was considered in isolation. The analysis did not consider second- or third-order effects. It also did not consider potentially offsetting impacts of new technologies, mitigating actions or new business opportunities. While the limitations of the analysis mean that it can\\'t be used to predict net long-term impact on financials or business operations, it nevertheless helped to validate our current business strategies and initiatives for energy demand, commodity sourcing, value chain innovation, water management and resiliency. We discussed the analysis with teams across our business and the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Walmart Board. For more information on this analysis, please see our 2018 CDP climate change disclosure.\\nClimate change mitigation\\nWe believe mitigating the effects of climate change will require collective action to reduce GHG emissions. Because most emissions in the retail sector lie in product supply chains rather than in stores and distribution centers, we have committed to pursue substantial emissions reduction not only in our own operations but also across product supply chains, by catalyzing and supporting initiatives among suppliers, NGOs, customers and others at scale.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n21\\n\\x0cSustainable operations\\nWe have set a science-based target12 to reduce GHG emissions in our own operations (Scopes 1 and 2) by 18% by 2025 (compared with 2015 levels) through multiple initiatives. These include increasing the energy efficiency of our buildings, aiming to power 50% of our operations with renewable energy by 2025, improving the performance of our refrigeration systems and maximizing the sustainability of our fleet.\\n\\nWe are on track to meet our goals. As of 2017, we had reduced emissions by 6.1% compared with 2015 levels.13 Also, renewable sources supplied an estimated 28% of our electricity needs globally;14 this includes generation from more than 520 projects across eight countries, 18 U.S. states and Puerto Rico. Based on our pipeline of solar and wind projects, we expect to source 35% of our electricity from renewables by 2020.\\n\\nAnnual greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1 & 2)15\\n\\nMillion MT COe\\n\\n25\\n\\n20\\n\\n6.76 6.11 6.65\\n\\n6.52\\n\\n15\\n\\n10\\n\\n12.16\\n\\n15.12 14.93 14.08\\n\\n5\\n\\n0\\n\\nCY2014\\n\\nCY2015\\n\\nCY2016\\n\\nCY2017\\n\\nScope 1\\n\\nScope 2\\n\\nCarbon intensity (Scopes 1 & 2)16\\n\\n$700,000 $600,000\\n\\n45.06\\n\\n43.63\\n\\n$500,000\\n\\n$400,000\\n\\n$300,000\\n\\n$200,000 $100,000\\n\\n$0\\n\\nFY2015\\n\\nFY2016\\n\\nTotal annual revenue [$M]\\n\\n$485,651 $482,130 $485,873 500,343\\n\\n50\\n\\n42.66\\n\\n45\\n\\n37.33\\n\\n40\\n\\n35\\n\\n30\\n\\n25\\n\\n20\\n\\n15\\n\\n10\\n\\n5\\n\\n0\\n\\nFY2017\\n\\nFY2018\\n\\nCarbon intensity [MT COe/$M]\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n22\\n\\x0cProject GigatonTM\\nBeyond our direct operations, we aim to galvanize transformative action through Project Gigaton, a global effort that invites suppliers to join us in a commitment to avoid 1 billion metric tons of emissions in our collective value chains by 2030.\\nLaunched in 2017, Project Gigaton engages suppliers in setting targets and pursuing initiatives to avoid emissions in any of six areas where there are opportunities to do so: energy use, sustainable agriculture, waste, deforestation, packaging and product use.\\nWe worked with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) on the overall concept and design, as well as the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), Conservation International (CI), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the Sustainable Packaging Coalition (SPC) and CDP to connect suppliers to measurement methodologies, guidance and practical tools to help them reduce emissions. The program builds upon lessons learned from initiatives Walmart has undertaken with suppliers and NGOs in the past, such as our 20 million metric ton initiative.\\n\"Project Gigaton is the biggest and best example of a company encouraging its suppliers to be part of the solution to climate change. Through Walmart\\'s scale, collaboration and innovation, it continues to lead the way on actions that create both business and environmental value.\"\\n--FRED KRUPP | PRESIDENT, EDF\\n\\nWalmart established an external review process to support continual improvement of the methodologies to account for avoided emissions from Project Gigaton. A steering committee with subcommittees of technical experts from CDP, EDF, SPC, WWF and others lead the review process. To learn more about the platform, tools, resources and measurement methodology visit Project Gigaton on the Walmart Sustainability Hub.\\nWe are currently on track to achieve our gigaton goal. To date, more than 1,000 suppliers have formally signed on to the project. In 2018 alone, 382 suppliers reported avoiding 58,904,20617 MT of emissions, totaling 93,656,63918 MT toward the 1 gigaton target in the first two years of the program. We encourage suppliers to set specific, measurable, actionable, relevant and time-bound (\"SMART\") goals, because we believe they lead to substantially better results over time; to date, 47% of Project Gigaton suppliers have set such goals.\\nIn the coming year, we plan to focus on attracting additional suppliers and broadening the scope of initiatives across programmatic areas. While the program is on track, nearly 80% of reported avoided emissions were related to energy (under the Energy or Product Use action areas). Fewer have made commitments related to Deforestation or Sustainable Agriculture, where success requires influencing a disparate set of actors far upstream in the supply chain, addressing interdependencies and barriers in complex social and economic systems, and gaining alignment with others regarding methodologies for measurement and action. We are working with suppliers and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to support the development of tools to enable some improvement in these areas.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n23\\n\\x0cProject Gigaton action areas\\nSuppliers can make commitments and pursue initiatives in one or more of six areas:\\n\\n1. Energy\\n\\nWe encourage suppliers to avoid energy-related emissions in two ways: first, reduce energy demand through optimization and efficiency; and second, to transition to energy sources that are renewable and emit little to no carbon. At the close of FY2019, our suppliers reported avoiding 25.2 million MT of emissions through work on energy.\\n\\nThe Walmart Factory\\n\\n25.2 MILLION\\nMT emissions avoided by Walmart suppliers through work on energy\\n\\nEnergy Efficiency Program (FEEP) is an example of how practical tools can facilitate emissions reductions in supply chains. Through FEEP,\\n\\nwe promote the\\n\\nuse of McKinsey & Company\\'s Resource Efficiency\\n\\nDeployment Engine (RedE), a web-based tool\\n\\ndesigned to help suppliers identify, prioritize and\\n\\nimplement energy efficiency projects. At the close\\n\\nof FY2019, more than 940 factories had joined the\\n\\nRedE system; active users report saving more than\\n\\n$29 million in annual operating expenses and avoiding\\n\\n199,854 MT of annual CO2e emissions.\\n\\n2. Waste\\n\\nFood, product and material waste in factories, warehouses, distribution centers and farms contributes to GHG emissions. Reducing and diverting waste from landfills can increase operating efficiency and lower costs. We encourage suppliers to reduce or eliminate waste from their operations, address postharvest losses on farms, standardize date labeling,\\n\\nextend product shelf life and educate customers about preventing food waste. Through philanthropy, we have also made investments to assess and reduce waste in food production and distribution. For example, the Walmart Foundation provided funding to the World Resources Institute to implement and accelerate adoption of its Food Loss and Waste Protocol, a publicly available approach to measure food waste and loss. See the Waste section of this report for more information on our efforts to reduce waste in our operations and product value chains.\\n3. Packaging\\nProject Gigaton invites suppliers to avoid emissions -- as well as drive down waste -- by reducing unnecessary packaging, optimizing packaging materials and increasing the reuse and recycling of packaging.\\nWalmart is taking specific aim at plastics, with expanded waste reduction commitments for our U.S. private brands -- commitments that are expected to impact an estimated 30,000 items for sale. Read more about our work to address plastic packaging in our value chain in the Waste section of this report.\\nOne example of progress: In FY2019, more than 800 Walmart private label suppliers signed up for the How2Recycle label (compared with only 100 in FY2018), and more than 16,000 Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) received the How2Recycle label.\\n4. Agriculture\\nBy pursuing and encouraging suppliers to adopt best practices in areas such as manure management, enteric emissions, feed inputs and other activities in animal agriculture, along with fertilizer optimization in crop production, we estimate there is a potential to impact 20% to 30% of our Project Gigaton GHG\\n\\nemissions goal by 2030 while reducing waste and improving yield.\\nWe have been working with many of our suppliers to support efforts to reduce emissions through fertilizer optimization. Collectively, suppliers have committed 36 million acres of land in these programs. Additionally, as part of our engagement with the Midwest Row Crop Collaborative, we supported the enrollment of over 140 demonstration farms in the Soil Health Partnership, an organization helping farmers use tools to identify, test and measure management practices for improving soil health.\\n5. Deforestation\\nWalmart invites suppliers to join us in working to reduce deforestation through innovative sourcing strategies and the use of technology to increase transparency and supply chain accountability. For example, some suppliers are participating in place-based, multi-stakeholder initiatives that are intended to reduce forest loss and degradation.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n24\\n\\x0cProject Gigaton participant Unilever committed to supporting work in Sabah, Malaysia as part of its strategy to achieve a deforestationfree supply chain and avoid emissions. Unilever will help certify 60,000 hectares to the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) standards in Sabah as part of a program led by Forever Sabah, WWF Malaysia and the Palm Oil & NGO (PONGO) Alliance.\\nWe also support certifications to reduce forest loss and improve sustainability of commodities such as palm oil, pulp and paper, as well as Brazilian beef and soy. In 2015, based upon supplier reported data, 100% of our private-brand palm oil was sourced through a combination of RSPO certification criteria, including Mass Balance, Segregated, Identity Preserved and Credits. In 2017, we strengthened our efforts and set a more ambitious goal to source our private-brand palm oil in accordance with the principles and criteria of RSPO, using only Mass Balance or Segregated supply chain systems, or equivalent standards, by the end of 2020.\\n6. Product use & design\\nDesigners, manufacturers and brands have an opportunity to help customers lower the GHG emissions associated with their use of a product (and often saving customers money at the same time). In Project Gigaton, we ask suppliers to commit, in particular, to improving the in-use energy efficiency of their products.\\nWalmart has collaborated with suppliers on product innovations that have helped consumers reduce emissions -- such as working with suppliers to popularize LED lightbulbs. More recently, Project Gigaton participant Procter & Gamble announced\\n\\na commitment to cut 50 million metric tons of emissions from its operations and value chain by 2030. As part of that commitment, the Tide #QuickColdPledge encourages customers to switch to quick and cold laundry cycles.\\nFor more on how suppliers are demonstrating progress through Project Gigaton, visit our Supplier Recognition page.\\nClimate change adaptation\\nWith operations and a value chain that span the globe, we are incorporating resiliency planning and initiatives into parts of our business to help address the effects of climate change.\\nResilient sourcing\\nIn some cases where the availability or quality of commodities is susceptible to climate variables such as drought, storms and temperature, we are working with our buyers, distribution teams and suppliers on resiliency plans. For example, in our food business, we are working with produce suppliers on strategies such as using greenhouses to grow tomatoes and leafy greens, pioneering techniques to better manage growing conditions, improving yields and reducing the need for fertilizers.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n25\\n\\x0cDisaster response & resiliency\\nThrough Walmart\\'s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and Walmart\\'s planning and operational practices, we identify, assess, triage and respond to natural disasters, including epidemiological issues, and security events that affect Walmart operations, associates and the communities we serve.\\nThe EOC operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to identify emerging risks, help facilities and associates prepare for disasters, monitor the development of crises, and serve as a triage point for emergencies in our stores or offices around the world. The EOC activates cross-functional subject matter teams throughout our business to prepare for and respond to disasters quickly and effectively.\\nThe EOC core team includes experts in emergency management who regularly train associates across the enterprise. We use data and predictive analytics to identify and assess weather and environmental risks. This data aids in disaster preparedness and helps maintain or quickly restore operations. In major disasters, we can deploy an array of internal resources, including mobile generators, fuel resources, trucks and associates who can help to manage our corporate response\\n\\nto the crises on the ground. Through the EOC\\'s efforts to coordinate with local, state and federal governmental agencies, as well as nonprofits and volunteer organizations around the world, Walmart is able to determine how it can help support local communities in the face of disaster.\\nPhilanthropy In the past two years, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation gave nearly $50 million in cash, water, food and other products to support victims of hurricanes, wildfires and tornadoes. Additionally, during the same time period, Walmart raised $44 million in donations from customers to support hurricane relief. We also fund the development of technologies that enhance situational awareness and enable coordination among first responders, such as RC View.\\nLearn more about our Disaster Relief program at Walmart.org.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n26\\n\\x0cSustainable supply chain\\nQUICK FACTS\\nWalmart and Sam\\'s Club U.S. suppliers have improved their Sustainability Index scores by 28% compared with 201619\\nAs of the end of FY2019, we achieved a supplier Sustainability Index participation rate that covers 80% of the goods we sell in U.S. Walmart stores and Sam\\'s Club locations for categories where the Sustainability Index is available\\n\\nAccording to supplier reports, nearly 100% of Walmart U.S. stores\\' and clubs\\' seafood selection is sourced in accordance with our sustainable seafood policy\\n\\nPolicies & resources\\n\\nWalmart Sustainability Hub\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Sustainability Index\\n\\n\\n\\nCorporate policies\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Sustainability Index\\nOur aspirations for sustainable product supply chains go beyond managing risk in our own sourcing; we aim to bring about significant and lasting improvement across product supply chains through collaborative efforts with suppliers, NGOs and others.\\nWalmart encourages suppliers to report through the Sustainability Index, a science-based, thirdparty tool developed by The Sustainability Consortium in collaboration with universities, NGOs and suppliers. The Index includes data from suppliers on key environmental, social and other\\n\\nperformance indicators at the category level. The Index reflects responses from more than 1,500 unique suppliers covering 115 categories and departments across Walmart U.S. and Sam\\'s Club U.S.\\nWe set a goal in 2012 to buy 70% of our U.S. goods from suppliers that participate in the Index (in categories covered by the Index). We met that goal in 2017, and in 2018, more than 80% of such goods came from participating suppliers.

In 2005, Walmart set an aspirational goal to achieve zero waste in our own operations. By 2025, we aim to achieve that goal in Canada, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S.21 In 2018, we diverted 78% of our unsold products, packaging and other materials from landfill and incineration globally.22 We also work with our suppliers to reduce waste through Project Gigaton. Two areas of particular focus are plastic and food waste. In addition to addressing plastic and food waste in our operations, we are working with suppliers upstream and building capacity with consumers and other organizations to eliminate waste downstream.\\n\\nQUICK FACTS\\nIn the U.S., we diverted 81% of our unsold products, packaging and other waste materials from landfills and incineration\\nGlobally, we diverted more than 1.6 billion pounds of food waste from landfills23\\n\\nRecycled more than 430 million pounds of plastic film and rigid plastics globally\\nDonated more than 720 million pounds of food globally, which includes 640 million pounds in the U.S.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\nPolicies & resources\\n\\nWalmart Sustainability Hub: Waste\\n\\n\\n\\nWalmart Sustainability Hub: Packaging\\n\\n\\n\\nSustainable Packaging Playbook\\n\\n\\n\\n32\\n\\x0cWALMART GLOBAL WASTE DESTINATION MIX\\nRecycling: 68%\\nDonation to people: 5%\\nAnimal feed: 3%\\nAnaerobic digestion: 1%\\nComposting: 1%\\nIncineration with and without energy recovery: 1%\\nLandfill: 21%\\n\\nPlastic waste\\nWhile plastic provides numerous benefits in areas such as food safety and packaging flexibility, society has been unable to collect and recycle plastic at the same rate as it is produced. According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, in 2016, less than 14% of plastic packaging was collected for recycling globally, with the rest ending up in landfills, rivers and oceans.\\nPlastic waste in our operations\\nWalmart\\'s aspiration is to achieve zero plastic waste. We are taking actions across our business to use less plastic, recycle more and support innovations to improve plastic waste reduction systems. For example, we aim to use reusable packing containers instead of disposable packaging whenever possible. When we do use disposable packaging, we try to recycle as much of it as possible. In 2018, we recycled 430 million pounds of plastic film and rigid plastics globally.\\nPlastic waste in our value chain\\nApproximately 40% of non-fiber plastic produced is used in packaging, the majority of which is used once and discarded. We have asked our suppliers to reduce\\n\\nunnecessary plastic packaging, increase packaging recyclability and increase recycled content, and to help us educate customers on reducing, reusing and recycling plastic.\\nAs of February 2019, we have committed to work with our U.S. private brand suppliers to:\\n Achieve 100% recyclable, reusable or industrially compostable packaging in all Walmart private-brand products by 2025\\n Target at least 20% post-consumer recycled content in private-brand packaging by 2025\\n Label 100% of food and consumable private-brand packaging with the How2Recycle label by 2022\\n Eliminate the nonrecyclable packaging material PVC in general merchandise packaging by 2020\\n Reduce private brand plastic packaging when possible\\nWe encourage our national brand suppliers to make similar packaging commitments through Project Gigaton; we engage them on sustainable packaging best practices to support the creation and achievement of such goals.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n33\\n\\x0cTo encourage customers to recycle, we have asked suppliers to put more consumer-friendly recycling information on packaging. In the U.S., Walmart encourages use of the Sustainable Packaging Coalition\\'s How2Recycle label; in 2019 Walmart Canada announced a commitment to use this label on all private brand products by 2025.\\nBeyond packaging, we are also working to offer access to low-cost, high-quality alternatives for single-use plastic consumable products and plastic bags.\\nWe participate in the plastic working group at the Consumer Goods Forum and we support The UK Plastic Pact; we are also signatories to the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment.\\nTo learn more about our initiatives to eliminate waste, including our Sustainable Packaging Position Statement and Playbook, see the Walmart Sustainability Hub, Walmart Canada and Walmart Mexico.\\nPhilanthropy\\nTo help reduce plastic waste in the U.S., the Walmart Foundation has made targeted investments to support materials innovation, recycling collection and/or sortation infrastructure and consumer education. For example, the Walmart Foundation has supported the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation\\'s Beyond 34 project, an initiative aimed at increasing the U.S. recycling rate.\\nLearn more at Walmart.org.\\n\\nFood waste\\nWe are inspired by the U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 12.3 to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer level and reduce food losses along production and supply chains by 2030. Our end-to-end approach for addressing food waste includes pursuing best practices in our operations, building capacity in the broader food recovery system, working with suppliers upstream and empowering consumers downstream.\\nFood waste in our operations\\nWe aim for Zero Waste24 in our operations in Canada, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., which encompasses food waste. We are a signatory to the Consumer Goods Forum\\'s Food Waste Resolution and a member of the U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions, both of which seek to halve food waste. In FY2019, Walmart Canada committed to achieve zero food waste by 2025.\\nThe primary way we reduce food waste in our operations is by working to increase the sell-through rate. In the U.S., for example, we have strengthened our forecasting and ordering tools to improve inventory flow, adjusted store fixtures to increase turnover and customer appeal, made enhancements in our distribution centers, and provided our store associates with resources and education on how to better care for food and manage it at the end of shelf life. We are seeing results. In FY2019, we had 90 million fewer wasted units in our fresh departments in the U.S. as compared with last year.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n34\\n\\x0cWe have also created a customized field-to-store network for highly perishable products, which is designed to reduce days in transit and increase freshness for customers. To support this network, we introduced specialized upstream nodes to consolidate\\n\\nproducts, which allow fresh produce to move faster through every step of the transportation process. While decreasing inventory and waste, our produce moves through our Speed Fresh Supply Chain up to 1.8 days faster.\\nAdditionally, in several markets, we adjust our product specifications to accept size and other cosmetic variations that don\\'t affect the quality of fresh produce. For example, our Asda stores in the U.K. sell cosmetically imperfect, or \"ugly,\" fruits and vegetables under a variety of labels. In FY2019, Asda sold more than a million boxes of this produce, avoiding 1.5 million pounds of waste.\\nIn Canada, China, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. we offer discounts on food that is close to its expiration date, including meat, bakery, dry goods and dairy. In FY2019, we sold more than 320 million units through these programs in the U.S., saving our customers money and helping prevent food waste.\\nWhen food goes unpurchased, Walmart works to maximize its use by getting it to people and places\\n\\nthat need it. In addition to donating food to food banks and other charities, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation have donated funds to purchase equipment to increase the capacity of the charitable\\n\\n1.6 BILLION\\npounds of food waste diverted from landfills globally25\\n\\nmeal system to transport\\n\\nand deliver fresh food. In FY2019, we donated\\n\\n640 million pounds of food in the U.S. alone.\\n\\nIf food is no longer edible, we try to convert it to animal feed, compost or energy. Our Asda stores, for example, are recycling food into energy by taking inedible unsold food to anaerobic digestion plants, where it is broken down into gases that can be used as fuel and fertilizers.\\n\\nIn 2018, we diverted more than 1.6 billion pounds of food waste from landfills globally. We also received a B, the highest score among U.S. supermarkets assessed, in the Center for Biological Diversity\\'s\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n35\\n\\x0cstudy on food waste. The study reviewed American supermarkets\\' food waste reduction commitments, policies and actions.\\nFood waste in our value chain\\nWe undertake efforts to help eliminate food waste in our value chains beyond our own operations. As noted above in the discussion of fresh supply chain improvements, our efforts include reducing days in the supply chain from point of origin to store.\\nAs well, through Project Gigaton, Walmart is encouraging our suppliers to measure and report food waste; introduce reprocessing, donation and recycling practices; and standardize date labeling (when the date is required for quality reasons only) to eliminate customer confusion. In FY2018, 92% of our private-brand products in the U.S. used \"Best If Used By\" date labels unless a food safety or regulatory reason prevented us from doing so. Beyond our private-brand suppliers, we also advocate for other suppliers to standardize date labels across their brands in line with the Consumer Goods Forum\\'s Date Labeling Call to Action.\\nFor more information on our work to reduce food waste, please visit our Global responsibility website.\\n\\nPhilanthropy\\nThe Walmart Foundation\\'s philanthropic investments help drive system-wide change by investing in prevention efforts to stop food waste and loss from occurring, and the recovery and redistribution of edible food that would otherwise go to waste, specifically from farms and retail settings. The Walmart Foundation made a commitment to award $15 million to organizations that help reduce food waste and strengthen food banks in Canada from FY2017 through FY2020; more than $11 million has been allocated so far. The Walmart Foundation has also supported organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund in conducting research and analyzing policies that advance solutions for preventing food waste and loss.\\nLearn more at Walmart.org.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n36\\n\\x0cEnvironmental advocacy\\n\\nWalmart engages in advocacy and coalitions to promote environmental public policy that aligns with our shared value business objectives. Examples include:\\n We Are Still In: To promote the aims of the Paris Climate Agreement after the announcement of the U.S. withdrawal, Walmart joined an initiative called We Are Still In. This is a signal to world leaders that Americans will not retreat from the global pact to reduce emissions and stem the causes of climate change.\\n Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance: We are members of this coalition that brings together purchasers and suppliers of renewable energy to make the process of transitioning to cleaner energy sources easier.\\n Paris and Bonn negotiations: We participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conferences in 2015 and 2017 to collaborate with international stakeholders in advancing environmental issues around the world.\\n\\n Global Forest Watch Pro: To promote transparency and traceability across our supply chains, in 2017, Walmart joined the World Resources Institute and 20 other companies to launch Global Forest Watch Pro, an online platform that provides companies, banks and other stakeholders with data and tools for monitoring global forest loss because of the production of key commodities such as palm oil, soy and Brazilian beef.\\n Consumer Goods Forum: We are a member and our CEO serves on its Board of Directors.

He talked about wanting to \"take care of our associates\" and support the vision customers hold for their communities. While Sam used his own words, a respect for human rights corresponds with the core values he instilled in our company.\\nHuman rights statement\\nFor many years, our perspectives and initiatives that underscore our respect for human rights were described across a number of statements (e.g., Supplier Code of Conduct) and documents (e.g., Ethics and Compliance Report). In November 2018, we published Walmart\\'s first Human Rights Statement, which consolidates our perspectives in one place.\\n\\nAs part of our work to develop our Human Rights Statement, we convened a cross-functional Steering Committee as well as a Working Group who:\\n Reviewed a variety of international instruments including, but not limited to, the United Nations (U.N.)

We have shared it with associates via team meetings, presentations, social media and other outreach. After publication of this report, we expect to expand our communication efforts with our associates and suppliers.\\nHuman rights: governance and implementation\\nIn 2018, we launched a cross-functional Human Rights Steering Committee, comprised of Walmart leaders from Global Responsibility; Human Resources; Labor Relations; Responsible Sourcing; Culture, Diversity & Inclusion; Government Affairs; Communications; and Legal. This group oversees and guides our human rights approach at an enterprise level, which includes identifying our priority issues across the enterprise. In addition, this group provides a cross-functional perspective on the company\\'s approach to ongoing implementation of our Human Rights Statement, such as through policies and procedures, and offers guidance and counsel to relevant stakeholders as part of that process.\\nThe Steering Committee is supported by a Human Rights Working Group, which meets regularly and consists of members from each department as noted above. Last year, the Steering Committee and Working Group focused on:\\n\\n Developing our Human Rights Statement  Mapping the various policies and procedures\\nwe have in place to help mitigate potential human rights issues\\n Consulting a variety of human rights subject matter experts for their insights\\n Identifying our salient human rights issues\\nWe have identified several steps to continue advancing our work on human rights at Walmart, including:\\n Assess potential adverse human rights impacts and the relevant processes in place\\n Integrate relevant findings into policies and procedures\\n Track progress as part of Walmart\\'s efforts to continuously improve\\n Communicate with relevant internal and external stakeholders for insight on our progress and priorities\\n Adjust our human rights priorities as needed\\nExternal stakeholders\\nWe value and routinely engage external stakeholders for their perspectives on human rights.\\nFor example, as we developed our Human Rights Statement, we spoke with subject matter experts from BSR, Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, Institute for Human Rights and Business, New York University Stern Center for Business & Human Rights and Shift. We also engaged others through dialogue (e.g., Issara Institute and International Justice Mission through efforts combating forced labor) and forums (e.g., U.N.

In some cases, we open a formal investigation, using internal investigators or a third party, depending on the nature of the allegation. We work to see that concerns are appropriately addressed in a timely manner.\\nWe also monitor the number and types of inquiries and allegations received through these and other channels. This information helps us to understand where we may need to strengthen policies or procedures.\\nWe encourage stakeholders to raise concerns and to report activities they suspect may contravene the values and positions we express in our policies and statements. We will not retaliate against any party for raising concerns in good faith.\\nFor additional information about the mechanisms we have in place to hear concerns, please visit the following sections of this report:\\n Associate voice\\n Sourcing responsibly\\n Ethics & compliance\\n\\nWe are also mindful that human rights abuses can be the result of systemic issues, increasing the complexity of issue resolution. As an example, in 2013, Walmart was a founding member of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which provided extensive fire safety training; gave access to a 24hour, confidential helpline to report safety and other job-related concerns; and supported extensive remediation of factory safety issues. According to the Alliance\\'s fifth annual report, 90% of high-priority remediation items were complete across all factories affiliated with the Alliance and nearly 1.6 million workers have been trained in fire safety. More than 1.5 million workers now have access to the 24-hour confidential helpline. While the Alliance\\'s commitment ended in 2018, Walmart remains dedicated to worker safety in Bangladesh.\\nWalmart\\'s next steps\\nIn this next year, we expect to:\\n Continue to broadly communicate our Human Rights Statement with our associates and suppliers as well as customers and the communities in which we operate so that they may be familiar with the concepts and values within it.\\n Continue to engage human rights thought leaders and stakeholders to help us advance our initiatives and improve our effectiveness.\\n Continue to develop our reporting, as we learn more about what our associates and stakeholders would like to know.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n44\\n\\x0cRetail opportunity\\n\\nOne of society\\'s greatest challenges is helping workers gain the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the jobs of today and prepare for the jobs of tomorrow.\\nToday, millions of jobs are left unfilled as employers struggle to find workers with the skills needed to fill open positions. In the coming decades, growth in automation will likely exacerbate the skill development challenge as technology drives rapid change in the types of jobs available for workers and the capabilities they need to fulfill those roles.\\nThe retail sector -- as a foundational entry point to work, a place to gain valuable skills and a significant portion of the overall job market -- provides a gateway to upward mobility for millions of people and can help address the global need for workforce development. Recognizing this, Walmart is committed to helping make retail a place of opportunity: a launching pad for people to acquire the skills and experience needed to advance in the workforce.\\n\\nQUICK FACTS\\nAccess to employment\\nApproximately 2.2 million associates in thousands of communities around the world\\nStability\\nThe average wage of a full-time, hourly field associate in our Walmart U.S. stores as of March 2019 is $14.2630\\nAverage total compensation and benefits for a full-time, hourly field associate in our Walmart U.S. stores is $19.31 per hour, including wages, bonuses and benefits31\\n$793 million in bonuses delivered to fulland part-time hourly associates in our Walmart U.S. stores\\n\\nThe majority of the hourly associates in our Walmart U.S. stores are full-time\\nWe\\'ve reduced our Walmart U.S. store associate turnover by 10% or 1000 bps, the lowest level in five years\\nWe have more than 35,000 people working in our U.S. stores in roles that didn\\'t exist two years ago\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n45\\n\\x0cPolicies & resources\\n\\nHuman Rights Statement\\n\\n\\n\\nStatement of Ethics\\n\\n\\n\\nMobility\\nOpened nearly 200 Walmart Academies in the U.S.\\nMore than 800,000 employees trained in Walmart Academies as of March 2019 since program\\'s inception\\nMore than 850,000 U.S. employees trained in Walmart Pathways since program\\'s inception\\nPromoted more than 215,000 people to jobs of greater responsibility and higher pay in Walmart U.S. stores in Fiscal Year 2019\\nMore than 75% of our Walmart U.S. store operation management team members started as hourly employees\\nWalmart store managers earn an average of $175,000/year in the U.S.\\n\\nDiversity & inclusion32\\n55% of total U.S. workforce is female\\n43% of U.S. management is female\\n26% of Information Technology and Engineering workforce is female\\n44% of associates with revenueproducing responsibility are women33\\n44% of total U.S. workforce are people of color\\n33% of U.S. management are people of color\\n34% of associates with revenue producing-responsibility are people of color34\\n16% of associates with revenueproducing responsibility are women of color35\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n46\\n\\x0cRetail opportunity at Walmart\\nWalmart offers a wide variety of career opportunities, low barriers to entry, competitive wages and benefits, and paths to advancement through onthe-job coaching, training and education. By helping associates acquire the skills they need to advance, we aim to offer a distinctive employee value proposition among retailers.\\nOur workforce philosophy is formed around three foundational pillars -- access to employment, stability and mobility -- designed to lead people from entry to opportunity while forging a model for addressing global workforce development challenges. We\\'re seeing the results of this approach in the U.S.:\\n Turnover in our Walmart U.S. stores is down more than 10% or 1000 bps -- the lowest level in five years\\n Nearly three out of four associates would refer friends or family to Walmart for employment\\n As of year-end FY2019, we promoted more than 215,000 associates to jobs with more responsibility and higher pay in Walmart U.S. stores\\n As of FY2019, more than 75% of our store operations management team members began as hourly associates\\n On average, a Walmart store manager makes $175,000 per year\\nAccess to employment\\nEntry-level jobs provide economic opportunity and a pathway to upward mobility for many people. Such pathways are especially critical at a time when, according to the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce, job opportunities for lower-skilled workers across the U.S. economy have decreased.\\n\\nWalmart provides jobs for over\\n\\nONE\\n\\n1 million people\\n\\nMILLION+ in\\n\\nthe U.S. (and over\\n\\nU.S. jobs provided\\n\\n2 million worldwide).\\n\\nFor many of our\\n\\nentry-level hourly positions, we do not require\\n\\ndegrees and we have \"banned the box\" to lower\\n\\nbarriers to entering the workforce. And we provide\\n\\nopportunities for associates to learn important\\n\\nand transferable job skills, advance their education,\\n\\nand even gain college credit -- all while earning\\n\\na paycheck.\\n\\nStability\\nIn addition to providing an entry to employment, we strive to help associates maintain job stability so they are encouraged to stay with Walmart and are positioned to grow their skills and knowledge on the job. For example, in the U.S., we aim to do this by providing competitive pay and benefits, enhancing scheduling, and improving job design, leveraging technology to make jobs more rewarding. In a U.S. associate survey from FY2019, 74% shared that they feel they were able to plan or request their schedule far enough in advance to balance their work and personal life. Specific stability initiatives in the U.S. include the following:\\nPay\\n We have raised our starting wages in the U.S. by more than 50% over the past three years.\\n 100% of our U.S. associates earn above the federal minimum wage (which is currently $7.25/hour); newly hired associates start at $11 per hour or more, while key department manager roles can earn as much as $24.70 per hour.\\n\\n The average wage of a full-time, hourly field associate in our Walmart U.S. stores as of March 2019, is $14.26 per hour.36\\n Average total compensation and benefits for a full-time, hourly field associate in our Walmart U.S. stores is $19.31 per hour, including wages, bonuses, and benefits such as paid time off.37\\n In FY2019, $793 million in bonuses were delivered to full- and part-time hourly associates in our Walmart U.S. stores.\\n Financial planning tools: Using the Even app, our associates can access tools to help them plan for bills and savings goals, eliminating the work of figuring out how much money is okay to spend. When unexpected expenses occur, our associates can access earned wages ahead of scheduled paychecks using an \"Instapay\" feature. The tools are available to all hourly and salaried Walmart, Sam\\'s Club and Walmart U.S. eCommerce associates. As of February 2019, 600,000 associates used the Even app.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n47\\n\\x0cBenefits\\n Healthcare: Walmart offers health benefits starting at around $26 per pay period for all full- and part-time associates who have worked an average of 30 hours per week over the past 12 months. This is about 40% less than the national average cost for singleperson coverage.\\n 401(k): We offer 401(k) contributions and provide full- and part-time hourly U.S. associates a match of up to 6% after one year on the job. Associates are eligible to contribute to their 401(k) on their first day of work.\\n Paid time off (PTO): Walmart\\'s U.S. PTO policy streamlines paid vacation, sick time, personal time and holiday time into one category. In February 2019, we introduced protected PTO, where not required by paid sick leave laws, allowing our associates to earn up to 48 hours of paid time that can be used anytime to cover scheduled shifts when they are unexpectedly not able to make it to work.\\n Expanded parental leave, covering U.S. salaried and fulltime hourly associates: Walmart provides associates with parental leave, as well as assistance with adoption expenses.\\n-- The parental benefit supports associates who become parents through birth, adoption or fostercare placement with up to six weeks of protected paid time away from work.\\n-- Birth moms can receive 16 weeks of total paid time away when maternity and parental are combined (10 weeks of maternity and six weeks of parental leave).\\n-- These changes create parity for maternity and parental leave benefits among salaried and fulltime hourly associates.\\n\\nScheduling\\n More than 50% of hourly associates in our Walmart U.S. stores are full-time.\\n Predictable scheduling: We recently improved schedule predictability with a new system based on a method called core hours. Associates with core-hour schedules normally work the same weekly shifts for at least 13 weeks, enabling them to plan and prioritize important responsibilities outside of work.\\n Flexible scheduling: In November 2018, we rolled out My Walmart Schedule, a system that allows associates to view schedules, swap shifts with other associates and pick up unfilled shifts.\\nEvolving job design\\nMeeting customer demand for new and better experiences requires changes to jobs, new associate skills, and redesign of store processes and systems.\\nEven as technology enables efficiencies in some areas, we\\'re creating new opportunities and training associates to lead in others. We have more than 35,000 people working in our U.S. stores in roles that didn\\'t exist two years ago. Some of those roles include personal shoppers for Online Grocery Pickup, self-checkout hosts and customer hosts. We\\'re also providing associates with tools that help them do their jobs such as AI-powered FAST Unloaders that make unloading trucks more efficient, which can enable associates who previously spent large portions of their shifts unloading trucks to learn new skills such as customer service and merchandising.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n48\\n\\x0cMobility\\n\\nAccording to a Pew Research Center survey\\n\\nconducted in association with the Markle\\n\\nFoundation, a majority of U.S. workers say that\\n\\nnew skills and training are essential to career\\n\\nsuccess. Walmart aims to help workers gain the\\n\\nskills they need to succeed within our company and\\n\\nbeyond. For example, in Walmart U.S., we provide\\n\\non-the-job training and access to affordable,\\n\\nrelevant education programs including high school\\n\\ncompletion, college preparation and subsidized\\n\\nfour-year college degrees (with a head start for\\n\\nthose who receive college credit for Walmart\\n\\nexperience).

We promoted more than\\n\\n215,000 people to jobs of greater responsibility\\n\\nand higher pay in Walmart U.S. More than 75% of\\n\\nour Walmart U.S. store operations management\\n\\nteam members started as hourly employees,\\n\\nand Walmart store managers earn an average of\\n\\n$175,000/year in the U.S.\\n\\nTraining programs\\nWalmart U.S. offers all associates the opportunity to gain critical skills for job advancement, including language training and professional development. We also offer two structured training programs for associates at Walmart U.S. stores: Pathways and The Walmart Academy.\\n\\nBuilding foundational skills through Pathways\\nOur Pathways training program helps associates gain vital retail job skills, including customer service, merchandising, teamwork and communications. The program leverages self-paced, computer-based learning and mentoring from supervisors who provide feedback on associates\\' job performance and highlight potential career opportunities. More than 850,000 associates have completed the Pathways program since its inception.\\nBuilding advanced skills through Walmart Academy\\nWalmart Academy offers hands-on, immersive learning, combining technology, classroom training and ongoing coaching on the sales floor. Using cutting-edge handheld devices and virtual reality, the program prepares associates for jobs as frontline hourly supervisors, department managers and assistant managers. Associates are paid for the time spent in training.\\nIn the last three years, Walmart has opened nearly 200 Academies in the U.S., most within an hour\\'s drive of a Walmart store, and each Academy serves approximately 25 nearby stores. In FY2019 alone, we trained about 450,000 associates through Walmart Academy.\\nEducation opportunities\\nWalmart offers education benefits for General Educational Development (GED) certification, high school completion and college credit through an innovative approach to higher education that focuses on meeting the distinct needs of the adult working learner.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n49\\n\\x0cIn June 2018, Walmart teamed up with Guild Education to offer associates the opportunity to earn their high school diploma at no cost to them and a college degree for $1 per day. That means Walmart will subsidize the cost of higher education, beyond financial aid and an associate contribution equivalent to $1 per day. Available to all U.S. Walmart and Sam\\'s Club associates, the program offers access to both associate\\'s and bachelor\\'s degrees from three university partners, chosen based on their success with adult working learners. Associates can earn their associate\\'s degree in an area of their choice and a bachelor\\'s degree in business management and supply chain management. Associates have access to a counselor to help them navigate the application process and stick with the program. More than 1,500 students began classes in Fall 2018 across three university partners.\\nEmployees have taken notice of these opportunities, according to associate engagement surveys that Walmart conducts at least annually. In our most recent FY2019 U.S. associate engagement results, 81% of associates agreed with the statement, \"I have the training necessary to perform my job well.\" This reflects our increased investment in employee training. We are seeing additional benefits from our investments, as shown by the fact that the majority of our associates also agreed with the statement, \"I see a clear path for my career growth at Walmart.\" Finally, the survey also confirms that nearly 75% of our associates would refer friends or family to Walmart for employment.\\n\\nAssociate voice\\nAt Walmart, we aim to create a collaborative environment where associates are free to respectfully express their opinions and feel that their concerns are heard. We want associates to share their ideas for making our business better and relay, in confidence when appropriate, any workplace concerns. To that end, we gather and respond to associates\\' feedback in a variety of ways, including, for example, in the U.S.:\\n Personal, one-on-one interactions\\n Team meetings\\n Cascaded leadership communications\\n Company intranet\\n Facebook Workplace and other social media channels\\n Traditional digital communications, such as email\\nSenior operations executives also conduct formal listening tours twice a year with associates across the U.S. Additional annual company gatherings include the Year Beginning Meeting, Holiday Meeting and Shareholders\\' Associate Week. Our U.S. CEO also holds quarterly town hall meetings with associates and weekly operations feedback calls with store managers. During these sessions, any action items are assigned to field and home office associates, including officers, who are responsible for addressing each one.\\nThese engagement efforts have led to meaningful improvements in company policies. Through various lines of communication, our U.S. associates asked\\n\\nWalmart to consider changes such as expanding our parental leave, bonuses for work attendance and a PTObased time-off system so they would not incur penalties for sick leave. Walmart U.S. responded by implementing these practices.\\nWalmart\\'s Open Door process is another resource that allows any associate -- from entry level to the C-suite -- to share ideas and raise an issue in good faith at any time without fear of reprisal.\\nAdditional information on our Open Door policy, including our stance against retaliation for concerns raised in good faith, as well as guidance for our associates on when and how to use these resources, can be found in our Statement of Ethics.\\nConfidential resources\\nIn addition to the communication avenues described above, employees have access to a variety of confidential resources.\\nTo ask a question or report an ethics violation, employees can contact Walmart Global Ethics at www.WalmartEthics.com, via email at ethics@walmart.com or 1-800-WM-ETHIC in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada. Our Statement of Ethics outlines resources available globally. Walmart strictly forbids retaliation against any associate who reports a concern in good faith. Reports can be made anonymously and will be treated as confidential.\\nLearn more about how we communicate with associates in the Stakeholder engagement section.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n50\\n\\x0cFreedom of association\\nOne of our enduring core values since Sam Walton founded the company is Respect for the Individual.\\nOur associate freedom of association position\\nConsistent with applicable law and practice, Walmart respects the rights of associates to join, form or not to join an employee association or trade union of their choice without interference. Associates should exercise these rights in an informed manner, and with the benefit of thoughtful consideration and available information. In the exercise of these rights, we believe in the free exchange of ideas, opinions and information, provided there is no interference.\\nThese rights are defined under applicable national law and practice in the countries in which Walmart operates and from which Walmart sources the products we sell.\\n\\nGlobally, Walmart has associates who are represented by some form of collective bargaining in more than half of the 27 markets where we operate. The U.S. model is employee choice.\\nFostering inclusion\\nOur people and culture help make Walmart successful. We are committed to building a diverse workforce that represents the more than approximately 275 million customers who choose to shop with us instore or online every week. A variety of perspectives enriches our culture, leads to innovative solutions for our business and enables us to better meet the needs of a diverse customer base. We aim to develop inclusive leaders and an inclusive culture, while also growing the pipeline of women and people of color at every level. Walmart is a signatory to Catalyst CEO Champions for Change, CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion and Paradigm for Parity.\\nWalmart\\'s work to create a more inclusive company has been recognized by indices such as the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, the\\n\\nDisability Equality Index and the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, among others.\\nA truly inclusive workplace culture is one where all associates feel empowered to bring their authentic selves to work every day.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n51\\n\\x0cWomen representation at Walmart*\\n\\n43%\\nU.S. management\\n32%\\nU.S. corporate officers\\n25%\\nWalmart Board\\n\\n57%\\nU.S. hourly promotions\\n43%\\nU.S. management promotions\\n\\nWalmart Retail Trade Composite National Composite\\n\\n55%\\n\\n57%\\n\\n48%\\n\\nTotal U.S. workforce\\n\\nPeople of color representation at Walmart*\\n\\n33%\\nU.S. management\\n21%\\nU.S. corporate officers\\n16%\\nWalmart Board\\n\\n45%\\nU.S. hourly promotions\\n38%\\nU.S. management promotions\\n\\nWalmart Retail Trade Composite National Composite\\n\\n44%\\n\\n43%\\n\\n38%\\n\\nTotal U.S. workforce\\n\\n*Diversity & inclusion numbers are calculated based upon total U.S. workforce, including associates in the U.S. regardless of whether assigned to a subsidiary that owns or operates an ecommerce business, platform and/or marketplace.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\nOur approach\\nTo foster diversity and inclusion within Walmart, we focus on recruitment, development and retention. We seek to develop equity in representation and an inclusive culture and to confirm our commitment to fair-pay practices. An important component of fostering inclusion is raising awareness about unconscious bias. We have developed unconscious bias training for associates across the organization. All officers have Inclusive Leadership Expectations as part of their annual performance evaluation. A component of these expectations is abiding by our Statement of Ethics, failure of which may result in an annual cash incentive pay reduction. For more information, please see our Culture Diversity & Inclusion (CDI) Report.\\n52\\n\\x0cMeasuring progress\\nUsing engagement survey feedback, metrics on representation and inclusion indices, we\\'re measuring our progress and informing future priorities. Introduced in 2016, our CDI scorecard has proven to be a valuable tool, providing a biannual, actionable report that is reviewed by senior management.\\nFair pay\\nFairness in pay is an important issue for our company. We are committed to creating a performance culture where associates are rewarded based on meaningful factors such as qualifications, experience, performance and the type of work they do.\\nOur compensation plans and practices are designed to comply with applicable laws that require companies to pay their employees fairly and equitably. In the U.S., for example, relevant laws include Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Equal Pay Act, both of which require that men and women be given equal pay for equal work. Salary and wage ranges for our associates are based on objective factors, regardless of gender or race. We continually review our processes to make sure we are living up to our commitment to fair-pay practices.\\nRead more about Diversity & Inclusion programs and data.\\n\\neffort to accelerate retail and related sector employee advancement.\\nThrough the end of FY2019, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation had invested more than $100 million in organizations working to accelerate retail and related sector employee advancement.

In 1992, we launched our Responsible Sourcing program to establish our expectation that suppliers and their facilities operate responsibly, in a way that protects worker dignity. We set expectations through our Standards for Suppliers and use a riskbased approach to monitoring our supply chain, focusing audits on those geographies with greater potential risks.\\nWe also collaborate with peers and other industry stakeholders to address human rights issues in complex supply chains and to improve the capacity of the global retail sourcing system. Recognizing the need for whole-system transformation, Walmart has committed to use our ability to bring together stakeholders including industries, civil society, governments and international organizations to address the major potential risks to the dignity of workers in a minimum of 10 retail supply chains by 2025.\\n\\nQUICK FACTS\\nWalmart uses a risk-based approach to supply chain monitoring and focuses audits on geographies with greater potential risks\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\nSuppliers have disclosed more than 25,800 facilities in \"active\" status to Walmart in FY2019\\n\\nPolicies & resources\\n\\nResponsible Sourcing\\n\\n\\n\\nGlobal Ethics & Compliance\\n\\n\\n\\nStandards for Suppliers\\n\\n\\n\\nResponsible Sourcing Academy\\n\\n\\n\\nAudit and Assessment Policy and Guidance \\n\\nSupplier Disclosure Policy and Guidance\\n\\n\\n\\n54\\n\\x0cSourcing responsibly\\nGiven our size and global footprint, Walmart has a unique opportunity to use the power of our purchase orders to improve supply chain conditions. We set high expectations for our suppliers. Members of our Responsible Sourcing team around the world work to assess risk, monitor supply chain conditions\\n\\nthrough audit assessments and investigations, provide training and tools for suppliers, and collaborate with stakeholders to make progress on key industry-wide issues. The team also acts as a resource for fellow Walmart associates, providing training so that they can better understand and navigate potential human rights risks associated with various geographies\\n\\nand industries. Having our Responsible Sourcing associates embedded in markets around the world allows us to better understand regional challenges in our supply chains and leverage our local presence to build strong connections with local suppliers and markets. As of January 2019, we have more than 150 Responsible Sourcing associates.\\n\\nResponsible Sourcing associates are embedded in markets and hubs around the world to better support our global supply chain\\nAs of January 31, 2019, our associates were located in the following countries:\\n\\nAR Argentina\\n\\nID Indonesia\\n\\nBD Bangladesh JP Japan\\n\\nCM Cambodia\\n\\nMX Mexico\\n\\nCA Canada\\n\\nPK Pakistan\\n\\nCL Chile\\n\\nTH Thailand\\n\\nCN China\\n\\nUK United Kingdom\\n\\nCA\\n\\nUK\\n\\nCR Costa Rica\\n\\nUS United States\\n\\nGT Guatemala\\n\\nVT Vietnam\\n\\nUS\\n\\nIN India\\n\\nZA South Africa\\n\\nMX GT CR\\n\\nZA AR\\nCL\\n\\nJP\\n\\nCN PK\\nBD\\n\\nIN\\n\\nTH\\n\\nCM VT\\n\\nID\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n55\\n\\x0cStandards for suppliers\\nWe communicate our fundamental expectations to suppliers on social conditions, worker safety and integrity in the workplace through our Standards for Suppliers. Suppliers must agree to the Standards as part of their Supplier Agreement with Walmart. The Standards apply to anyone that supplies product to Walmart for resale, as well as any agents they use. Among other obligations, the Standards require our suppliers, and those who supply to them, to:\\n Comply with the law\\n Be transparent in their production for Walmart\\n Not use involuntary or underage labor\\n Maintain a fair process for making employment decisions\\n Comply with all applicable laws and agreements regarding compensation and working hours\\n Respect the principles of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining\\n Provide a safe work environment\\n\\nWe provide tools and resources for suppliers through the Responsible Sourcing Academy, which includes training, best practices, and educational materials developed by third parties and Walmart. More than 4,300 supplier representatives have registered in the Responsible Sourcing Academy.\\nMonitoring\\nThrough our risk-based monitoring program, we use third-party audits to evaluate supply chain practices against our Standards. After assessing the standards, protocols, governance and integrity of each program, the Responsible Sourcing team approved nine thirdparty audit programs. In addition, we work with the audit programs to make enhancements and share best practices for the benefit of the broader supply chain. To determine where regular audits will be required, we assign countries a classification of their potential social compliance risk level based on the World Bank governance indicators. Facilities in countries that fall into the highest level of risk -- which are identified as Category 2 and Category 3 countries -- are subject to\\n\\nregular audits. Facilities in Category 1 countries, such as the U.S., are subject to audits on a sample basis.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n56\\n\\x0cRisk-based social compliance audit assessments\\nWe take a risk-based approach to auditing, which allocates more resources to facilities located in countries with greater potential risks; facilities in higher-risk countries are required to submit regular audits, while facilities in lower-risk countries are audited on a sample basis. Facilities submit an approved third-party audit to Walmart, which we assess against our standards. In FY2019, we assessed more than 14,700 audits.\\n\\n2.1% 0.3%\\n23.7%\\n\\n10.8%\\n\\nFacilities for which we found general compliance.\\nFacilities that audits show to be generally compliant with our Standards but have failed to meet at least one important requirement. In these cases, we ask the facility to remediate noncompliances found in the audit report.\\nFacilities where we have found more significant violations. We will continue to source from facilities with orange ratings as they work to remediate the violations.\\nFacilities where serious infractions were found that may result in temporarily or permanently terminating the facility as a supplier to Walmart\\n\\n63.1%\\n\\nFacilities participating in our small supplier program and therefore did not receive a color rating.\\n\\nWalmart reviews each facility audit and assigns a color rating based on the third-party program\\'s ability to produce product for Walmart evaluation and Walmart\\'s own assessment of that evaluation. Green ratings represent facilities for which we found general compliance. Yellow ratings identify facilities that audits show to be generally compliant with our Standards but have failed to meet at least one important requirement. In these cases, we ask the facility to remediate noncompliances found in the audit report. Orange ratings identify facilities whose audits indicate more serious violations of the Standards, but from which Walmart will continue to allow sourcing while the violations are remediated. Red ratings identify facilities for which Responsible Sourcing has discovered violations of a nature that may make it appropriate to temporarily or\\n\\npermanently terminate the facility\\'s ability to produce product for Walmart.\\nWalmart reviews and assesses each audit report. Of the more than 14,700 thirdparty audit reports Walmart reviewed and assessed in FY2019, 23.7% received green, 63.1% received yellow, 10.8% received orange and 0.3% received red. An additional 2.1% of audits were for facilities participating in our small supplier program and, therefore, did not receive a color rating.\\nIn addition, Walmart operates several grievance mechanisms to solicit the concerns of workers in the supply chain. These include:\\n Global helpline: Walmart provides global and local phone numbers that anyone can use to ask questions and report concerns related to Walmart\\'s business, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\\n\\nThe helpline is equipped to handle most local languages spoken in each of the retail markets where we operate.\\n Global email address: This email address is available for reporting concerns, asking questions, or simply seeking guidance for situations that may be unclear. All contacts are received by Walmart\\'s Global Ethics and Compliance team in Bentonville, Arkansas.\\n WalmartEthics.com: This website is available in 13 languages and accessible globally. It provides a platform where stakeholders can ask questions, read our Statement of Ethics, submit ethical concerns and follow up on previously reported concerns.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n57\\n\\x0cCases resulting from these grievance mechanisms, as well as from audits and internal referrals, can be referred to our Responsible Sourcing Investigations or other compliance teams within Walmart. In FY2019, our Responsible Sourcing team opened more than 600 cases involving allegations of supply chain misconduct. Each case is reviewed and may include worker interviews, on-site visits and follow up with audit programs. Responsible Sourcing may also engage with the supplier directly, which typically includes a discussion regarding the allegations; a clarification of expectations; and the review, approval and follow up with the supplier on a corrective action plan. In FY2019, Walmart used this issue response process for more than 65 cases. Reports of misconduct ranged from issues such as lack of required posters to more serious violations that warranted in-depth scrutiny.\\nWe believe that staying engaged with suppliers through dialogue and corrective plans can have a more positive impact than simply abandoning the supplier relationship -- and in FY2019, more than 480 facilities remediated from orange to either yellow or green assessments. However, substantiated findings may result in consequences for suppliers, facilities or both -- up to and including termination of business with Walmart and its subsidiaries. Since 2012, we have stopped doing business with more than 30 suppliers in response to serious violations of our Standards.\\nLearn more about Supplier Standards at our Responsible Sourcing website.\\nStrengthening capacity of global audit systems\\nMany of the challenges we seek to address in our global supply chains are not unique to Walmart,\\n\\nand we are collaborating with our peers and key stakeholders to strengthen and standardize expectations for suppliers to drive transformation across supply chains. For instance, to help improve capacity of supply chain audits, Walmart and other stakeholders -- including third-party audit firms and other companies who rely on social compliance audits, audit programs and non-governmental organizations (NGO) -- established the Association of Professional Social Compliance Auditors (APSCA). The APSCA aims to increase the credibility and professionalism of auditors and audit programs across the industry. In 2018, the APSCA developed a Code of Professional Conduct and a Competency Framework for Auditors, and the group began piloting its certification process. As of January 31, 2019, more than 3,200 auditors have registered with the APSCA.\\nCollaborative efforts to address systemic issues\\nFor certain risks, supply chain monitoring and supplier engagement can only go so far. Long-term social sustainability in complex, global supply chains requires whole-system transformation and collective action of suppliers, NGOs, governments, retailers and others. Walmart has committed to work with others to address potential risks to the dignity of workers in a minimum of 10 retail supply chains by 2025; so far, we have focused on five supply chain initiatives:\\n Apparel in Bangladesh\\n Produce in the U.S. and Mexico\\n Shrimp in Thailand\\n Tuna processed in Thailand\\n Electronics sourced for the U.S. retail market supply chain\\n\\nTo help prioritize key geographies and supply chains, we analyzed internal data, audit findings and other external resources such as the World Bank global indices and government and media reports. We also considered where Walmart could have the biggest impact and identified collaborators that could help effect change.\\nIn such whole-system, collaborative efforts, Walmart engages through business and philanthropic initiatives that include:\\n Clarifying expectations with suppliers\\n Investing in research to understand prevalence of human rights violations and track progress toward improvement\\n Engaging with governments to advocate for laws, regulations and enforcement\\n Collaborating with key stakeholders and thought leaders in task forces and consortia\\n Building capacity in critical parts of the system (e.g., responsible recruitment, worker communication tools and monitoring technology)\\nTo gain deeper insight into these chains and the day-to-day experiences of workers, our associates also conduct on-site visits; cross-functional teams from Walmart undertook several such visits in 2018. Such on-site visits not only improve our ability to collaborate on whole-system change initiatives, they also help us improve our merchandising and responsible sourcing practices.\\nTwo human rights issues that we are particularly focused on through our responsible sourcing work and collaborative initiatives are forced labor and worker safety.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n58\\n\\x0cForced labor\\nWalmart has prioritized working with others to combat forced labor in the global supply chain. Example efforts include:\\n Responsible recruitment: As a member of the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment, Walmart works to create demand for ethically recruited workers in Thailand and Malaysia and advocate for better government regulation of recruitment agencies.\\n Seafood Task Force: Since 2015 we have participated in this international, multistakeholder initiative to address forced labor and illegal fishing in the Thai seafood supply chain. The Seafood Task Force has developed supply chain maps, established a system to track products across the supply chain, worked with government and industry stakeholders to improve regulation and codes of conduct, and championed fishery improvement projects. In FY2019, the Task Force Board approved the Vessel Auditable Standards, which extend auditing practices and performance expectations to fishing boats, beyond ports and land-based monitoring. Walmart also participates in the Tuna subgroup.\\n Immersive field visits: These visits help Walmart teams better understand complex forced labor issues in supply chains such as tuna. For example, a team comprised of Global Sourcing, Responsible Sourcing, Sustainability and Corporate Affairs visited Thailand and the Marshall Islands to explore the canned tuna supply chain. The team visited tuna boats, met workers, interviewed captains, saw processing plants and canning facilities, and observed unloading and loading processes.\\nThe Walmart Foundation also aims to decrease the risk of forced labor through philanthropic investments focused on: (1) strengthening demand\\n\\nfor responsible labor and practices; (2) using data and technology to increase transparency; (3) enhancing worker and community voice; and (4) supporting efforts to improve enforcement of existing regulations. For example, in FY2019, the Walmart Foundation provided support to FishWise to develop the Roadmap for Improving Seafood Ethics (RISE), an online platform that details steps companies can take to improve responsible practices in seafood supply chains. By providing tailored recommendations to producers, processors, brands and retailers on how to build, assess and improve social practices -- and track progress toward more ethical performance -- RISE can help drive advancements in worker dignity in fishing supply chains around the world.\\nAs another example, in 2016, the Walmart Foundation made a grant to International Justice Mission (IJM), building upon funding from other institutions, to help open the IJM Bangkok office to work alongside the Royal Thai Government as it combats human trafficking networks in the Thai fishing industry. Learn more at Walmart.org.\\nWalmart also supports the nonprofit Truckers Against Trafficking, which trains and encourages transportation professionals to recognize and report suspected human trafficking incidents. In 2015, Walmart conducted a training initiative with its private fleet drivers in the identification and prevention of human trafficking. In FY2020, Walmart plans to incorporate that same training into its newdriver onboarding process.\\nWorker safety\\nWe expect our suppliers to provide a safe working environment. To address systemic issues affecting worker conditions more broadly, we collaborate with other companies, NGOs and experts. For example, in 2013, Walmart was a founding member of the Alliance\\n\\nfor Bangladesh Worker Safety, which provided extensive fire safety training; gave access to a 24hour, confidential helpline to report safety and other job-related concerns; and supported remediation of factory safety issues.

In the U.S., Walmart and Sam\\'s Club sourced more than $11 billion from diverse suppliers in FY2019. Of this, $10.6 billion was for merchandising and $1.2 billion was for other goods and professional services.\\n\\nWe are also a member of the Billion Dollar Roundtable, which celebrates corporations that achieve spending of at least $1 billion with diverse businesses and adhere to the classification and reporting standards established by this organization.\\nUsing the National Minority Supplier Development Council\\'s and Women\\'s Business Enterprise National Council\\'s standard diverse business ownership definitions as benchmarks, we track diversity in our supply chain under the following diverse classifications: Women, African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Native Alaskans, members of the LGBT community, veterans, disabled veterans and other people with disabilities.\\nFor more information on our supplier diversity work, please see our Supplier Inclusion website.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\nPolicies & resources\\n\\nSupplier Inclusion Handbook\\n\\n\\n\\n60\\n\\x0cMarket access for smallholders in emerging markets\\nWalmart works to help develop small suppliers in countries around the globe, enabling them to establish their businesses as part of the regional retail supply chain. Beyond Walmart\\'s supply chain, the Walmart Foundation invests in programs to help enhance livelihoods for produce growers in Mexico, smallplot farmers in India and small enterprises in South Africa. For example, in India where smallholder farmers represent the backbone of the country\\'s economy, the Walmart Foundation, working beyond Walmart\\'s supply chain, made a commitment in 2018 to invest $25 million over the next five years to improve farmer livelihoods. At the same time, Walmart India has committed to source 25% of produce sold in its Cash & Carry stores from India\\'s smallholder farmers.\\nWhen the Walmart Foundation seeks out market access programs to support, we focus our funding on programs that help address women\\'s inclusion and empowerment. We ask about the design of projects and disaggregating data to understand any disproportionate impacts on program participants.\\nNearly\\n$30 BILLION*\\nspent with women-owned businesses in the past 7 years\\n*Totals for merchandising and services combined\\n\\nInvesting in American jobs\\nOur U.S. customers and communities are passionate about supporting American manufacturing. In 2013, we announced our goal of purchasing an additional $250 billion in products that will support American jobs through 2023. According to Boston Consulting Group, this initiative could create 1 million new U.S. jobs, including 250,000 manufacturing jobs directly, and 750,000 support and service sector jobs indirectly. We have achieved 94% of what we had initially estimated for this point and we are making steady progress across categories.\\nTo raise awareness of our initiative and encourage suppliers to identify new product opportunities, Walmart hosted the fifth annual Open Call for new U.S.-made products in June 2018. Entrepreneurs from 46 states participated in more than 500 meetings where they had an opportunity to pitch their products for Walmart stores.\\nWe have also:\\n Published the Policy Roadmap to Renew U.S. Manufacturing, outlining what government, manufacturers and retailers can do to create manufacturing areas of opportunity.\\n Released a report on the future of work in the U.S. on a county-by-county basis.\\n Established the Jobs in U.S. Manufacturing Portal for suppliers to access our knowledge base on the U.S. manufacturing industry.\\nAccording to data from our suppliers, approximately two-thirds of what we spend to buy products for Walmart U.S. goes toward items that are made, sourced or grown in the U.S.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n61\\n\\x0cProviding safer, healthier food & other products\\n\\nPolicies & resources\\n\\nFood Safety Policy\\n\\n\\n\\nProduct Safety & Compliance Policy \\n\\nSustainable Chemistry Commitment \\n\\nQUICK FACTS\\nWalmart was one of the founders of the Global Food Safety Initiative\\nMore than 4,990 food facilities that provide products to Walmart stores and Sam\\'s Clubs have been certified to one of the Global Food Safety Initiative\\'s standards\\nIn FY2019, we conducted more than 140,000 independent food safety audits at our stores and clubs globally\\nIn September 2018, Walmart U.S. required our existing fresh leafy green (e.g., romaine lettuce and spinach) suppliers to use blockchain technology for end-to-end traceability to help execute more targeted recalls and withdrawals\\nWalmart was the first U.S. retailer to announce a time-bound chemical footprint reduction goal\\nThrough our Wellness events, which take place four times per year, Walmart has provided ~3.3 million free health screenings to people across the U.S.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n62\\n\\x0cFood\\nFood safety\\nAs the world\\'s largest grocer, we are committed to playing a leading role in upholding food safety laws and regulations applicable to our global businesses, and to providing access to safe, high-quality foods. We helped found the Global Food Safety Initiative, and we are guided by our Food Safety Policy. Our Global Food Safety Compliance team includes food safety professionals who are responsible for overseeing a comprehensive Food Safety program in every market where we operate.\\nTo reduce food-safety-related risk in our supply chain, we require all private-brand suppliers and select categories of national-brand suppliers to achieve certification to one of the Global Food Safety Initiative\\'s internationally recognized food safety standards, which often exceed applicable regulatory requirements.\\nSince the initial rollout of this requirement, more than 4,990 food facilities that provide products to Walmart stores and Sam\\'s Clubs have been certified. Studies published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Food Protection have shown that Global Food Safety Initiative certification tends to help suppliers in strengthening their ability to produce safe foods and comply with regulations.\\nWe also strive to improve transparency and the traceability of the products we carry through technology such as blockchain. For example, Walmart China, working with IBM and Jinluo Meat Co., completed a proofofconcept pilot that dramatically reduced the time needed to trace select pork products back to the farm using blockchain. And, in the wake of E. coli outbreaks in 2018, Walmart U.S. asked our existing suppliers of\\n\\nleafy greens (e.g., romaine lettuce and spinach) to use blockchain technology to trace their products back to the farms where they originated.\\n\\nBlockchain technology has the potential to shine a light on all actors in the food system. This enhanced transparency can result in greater accountability, improved safety and more sustainable practices.\\n\\nThrough regular independent, third-party food safety audits of our stores and clubs that prepare fresh food, we assess adherence to Walmart food safety standards, processes, conditions and expected behaviors. These risk-based audits help us receive independent assurances that our stores are operating in a safe and legal manner.\\n\\nIn FY2019, we conducted\\n\\nmore than 140,000 independent food safety audits at our stores and clubs globally.\\nIn October 2016,\\n\\n>140,000\\nindependent food safety audits conducted globally\\n\\nWalmart created the\\n\\nBeijing-based Walmart Food Safety Collaboration\\n\\nCenter (WFSCC) to bring together local and\\n\\ninternational research into the root causes and\\n\\nprevention of foodborne illness.

Products identified with the Great for You icon have met nutrition criteria informed by the latest science and guidance from the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture and Institute of Medicine. The Great for You initiative has been recognized by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation as a leading nutrition program. For more information, please visit the Great for You section of our website.\\n\\nPhilanthropy\\nWalmart and the Walmart Foundation have made substantial investments designed to improve access to and availability of healthier food and increase people\\'s confidence to select, prepare and serve healthier food. Through Walmart\\'s food donations and additional philanthropic investments from Walmart and the Walmart Foundation, we met the goal we set in FY2014 to provide 4 billion meals to people in need by 2020, largely through the donation of unsold food. As of November 2018, we had also put funding in place to reach 4 million people with nutrition education. In FY2019, Walmart stores, clubs and distribution centers in the U.S. donated more than 640 million pounds of food, over 55% of which was fruits, vegetables and meat. Globally, Walmart donated a total of 720 million pounds of food in FY2019.\\nFor more information on our hunger relief and nutrition education efforts, please visit Walmart.org.\\n\\nProduct safety\\nWe are committed to providing our customers and members with access to safe and affordable merchandise.

The commitment asks suppliers to accelerate product reformulation, improve ingredient transparency and certify products using credible accreditations such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\\'s Safer Choice program.\\nLast year, we became the first U.S. retailer to announce a time-bound chemical footprint reduction goal and set a commitment to report annually to the Chemical Footprint Project. Our consumables chemical footprint is based on Walmart\\'s Priority Chemical list and includes chemicals such as formaldehyde and phthalates. By 2022, we aim to reduce the chemical footprint in personal care, beauty, baby, pet and household cleaning categories in U.S. stores by 10%. Our baseline for this goal is our calendar year 2017 footprint of approximately 190 million pounds for Walmart U.S. and approximately 30 million pounds for Sam\\'s Club. We made this baseline public in 2018.\\n\\nIn February 2019, we expanded our sustainable\\n\\nchemistry efforts and encouraged suppliers to\\n\\nlead on sustainable chemistry in apparel, footwear\\n\\nand soft home textile products and leverage\\n\\nthird-party certifications that assess and recognize\\n\\nleadership in line\\n\\nwith the principles of sustainable chemistry.

Through our Healthcare Begins Here platform we offer customers health insurance education and enrollment services in stores, online and via call centers during annual enrollment periods for Medicare and Affordable Care Act plans.\\nFor more information, including our Health and Wellness Policy, please visit our Health and Wellness compliance website and Health and Wellness blog.\\nOpioids\\nOpioid abuse and dependence are a serious public health issue that touches our communities, patients and associates. Walmart is committed to taking a leadership role on this issue and has developed a comprehensive opioid stewardship initiative with policies, programs and tools aimed at helping prevent opioid abuse and dependence.\\nWalmart and Sam\\'s Club limit the initial opioid prescription for an acute condition (one expected\\n\\nto heal fairly quickly) to 7 days -- informed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\'s guidelines. This limit helps reduce the number of pills dispensed, which both reduces the likelihood that the patient will become dependent upon opioids and reduces the volume of opioids that could be diverted for inappropriate uses by someone other than the patient.\\nWalmart and Sam\\'s Club pharmacists participate in opioid-related training programs and use their knowledge to educate patients on the risks of opioid use and to recommend the overdose medication, naloxone, for patients who may be at risk for overdose. Certain patients can be at risk of overdose even when using an opioid for a legitimate medical purpose. We also invest in drug education programs for youth in our communities. We offer a free, athome opioid disposal product to patients.\\nThese are just a few of the ways Walmart is working to address opioid abuse and misuse, and we are committed to adding new initiatives and partnerships to continue to serve as a corporate leader and partner to our communities.

Resolving to do this without taking precious resources from the planet means holding ourselves and our suppliers to ever higher standards. We know that accomplishing this work will require all of our best efforts. At Apple, we are committed to building groundbreaking products and services with the mission to leave our world better than we found it.\\nIt was just a year ago that we reached our goal of covering 100 percent of our operations with 100 percent renewable electricity. That work continues as we source the clean energy needed to maintain that standard -- even as our company grows. And our learnings have paid off in significant ways as we help the manufacturers in our supply chain make the same energy transition we have. To date, more than 40 suppliers have made commitments to join us, putting us well on track to exceed our goal of putting 4 gigawatts of clean energy online by 2020.\\nAt the same time, we are launching the next phase of our industry-leading work to better use and reuse materials with a state-of-the-art lab to support our research and innovation with material recovery. This initiative, along with Daisy - our fearless disassembly robot, means we\\'re doing even more with the materials from old devices our customers return for recycling. And we\\'ve found new ways to make it easier for devices that still have value to go on to another user. Our launch of the new MacBook Air and Mac Mini with enclosures made from 100% recycled aluminum was just the beginning: Together, we\\'re pioneering a future where we no longer need to mine precious materials from the Earth to make our products.\\nAt Apple, it\\'s simple. We apply the same level of innovation that goes into everything we create, design, power and manufacture to making things better for people and the planet. And we make it simple for customers and partners who share our passion to join us in this work. In a time where the threats facing our planet are too great to ignore, we are demonstrating that businesses must play a vital role. We are proud to do the hard work, to make the breakthroughs, and tirelessly search for ways to ensure the better future for our planet that we all deserve.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 3\\n\\x0cOur ambition: to make products without taking from the Earth.\\n\\nWe\\'ve embarked on a bold mission to make products without taking from the Earth.

The electricity at all of our facilities worldwide, including every Apple office, store, and data center, comes from 100 percent renewable energy--a standard we have maintained, even as we continue to grow. And we\\'re doing even more to transition our suppliers to 100 percent renewable energy and make our products of low-carbon materials.\\n\\nHighlights\\n\\nEmissions reductions\\nWe\\'ve significantly reduced our carbon emissions: by 64% since 2011 for Apple\\'s direct operations (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and by 35% for Apple\\'s entire footprint since it peaked in 2015.\\n\\nSupplier clean energy\\n44 Apple suppliers have committed to power all of their Apple production with 100% renewable energy.

That includes the emissions beyond our direct control, like those from sourcing materials, making our products, and our customers using their devices. We calculate our carbon footprint in five major areas: corporate facilities, product manufacturing, product use, product transportation, and product end-of-life processing. We use this information to tell us where to focus.\\nWe prioritize use of renewable energy, starting with our own facilities. We\\'ve transitioned to 100 percent renewable energy for the electricity we use at our offices, retail stores, and data centers around the world, which has reduced facilities emissions to only 2 percent of our comprehensive carbon footprint.5 And we\\'ve extended our efforts into our supply chain, where product manufacturing represents 74 percent of overall emissions. Whether designing a product, an operating system, or a manufacturing process, we consider the environmental impact--alongside cost, durability, form, and functionality. And because the cleanest energy is the energy you never use, we\\'re reducing energy use at facilities we operate as well as those where our suppliers make our products.\\n\\nOur approach to climate change\\n\\nRenewable energy Transition Apple and our suppliers to 100%\\nrenewable energy\\n\\nLow-carbon design Transition product materials,\\nmanufacturing processes, and operating systems to low-carbon alternatives\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\nEnergy efficiency Reduce energy use\\nat corporate and supplier facilities\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 8\\n\\x0cApple\\'s overall carbon footprint (fiscal year 2018)\\nApple calculates its life cycle carbon footprint to understand where to focus reduction efforts.\\n\\n74% Manufacturing\\n\\nmaciOdlSe12\\n\\nother13\\n\\n19% Product use 5% Product transport\\n2% Corporate facilities <1% End of life\\n\\nactimvaec 11OS\\n\\niOS active charge 10\\n\\nApple\\'s carbon footprint\\n25.2 million\\nmetric tons of CO2e\\n\\nfinal assembly\\n\\nintegrated circuits6\\n\\nsteel\\n\\nelectronics9\\n\\ndispla\\n\\ny other manufacturing 8\\n\\naluminum\\n\\nboards and flexes7\\n\\nNote: Manufacturing, Product use, Product transport, and End of life are Scope 3 emissions.

A major contributor to the decrease was Apple\\'s Supplier Clean Energy Program, which lowered our carbon footprint by nearly 3.6 million metric tons compared to last year. We also made several product design changes that reduced our carbon footprint, like sourcing aluminum made with hydroelectricity and recycled content, improving product energy efficiency, and redesigning integrated circuits to use less silicon. Together, these product design changes resulted in 4.8 million fewer metric tons of carbon emissions compared to last year.\\nHistorically, Apple\\'s carbon footprint has paralleled its financial performance. However, beginning in 2015, our environmental work has driven down our carbon emissions, even as revenue has increased.\\n\\nHistorical carbon footprint\\n\\n40\\n\\n270\\n\\nApple\\'s carbon footprint (million metric tons CO2e) Annual revenue (billion $)\\n\\n30\\n\\n210\\n\\n20\\n\\n140\\n\\n10\\n\\n70\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\\n\\nFiscal year\\n\\nApple revenue\\n\\nLifecycle carbon footprint\\n\\nEmission reductions\\n\\nSince 2015, Apple\\'s emissions reduction efforts have led to a significant decline in its comprehensive carbon footprint. Without these efforts, Apple\\'s fiscal year 2018 emissions would have been 35 percent greater.\\n\\nNote: We have been calculating the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of our products since 2007. Over time, we have greatly refined our model to include more Apple-specific data instead of industry averages. We made significant modeling changes in fiscal year 2016 to improve how we calculate emissions from the integrated circuits in Apple products, which resulted in a decrease in manufacturing emissions. And we make systematic changes each year to reflect changes in global electricity grids.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 10\\n\\x0cRenewable Energy\\nCharting the course to 100%.\\nApple pursues the strongest possible renewable solution in all markets where we operate. We stress a regional approach, with long-term energy contracts from new projects we help create. The following three principles guide this strategy:\\n Local displacement. We seek to displace more-polluting forms of energy in the same electric grid region as our facilities. We accomplish this by having Apple-created projects deliver into the grid as much renewable energy as our facilities take from it. In difficult renewable energy markets where our needs are less than 0.5 percent of our total energy use, we seek a renewable energy solution in the broader geographic region.\\n Materiality. We want our involvement in a renewable energy project to be a driving force to getting it built. That might mean providing needed financial support or helping the project overcome regulatory barriers. With the rapidly changing policy dynamics in some of our key countries, we\\'re adapting our framework to continue to comply with local laws and regulations and to yield the most positive and real energy transformation.\\n Accountability. We apply rigor in measuring and tracking our energy supply resources and use third-party registries such as WREGIS and NC-RETS, certification programs such as Green-e Energy, and contractual provisions to ensure that only Apple takes credit for the renewable energy it generates or procures. When no such system exists, we work with industry partners and governmental entities to create them.\\nApple Park, our newest corporate headquarters, obtains about 75 percent of its power from onsite fuel cells and rooftop solar PV panels.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 11\\n\\x0c600+ MW\\nOf the renewable energy projects Apple has helped create, we have direct ownership in over 600 megawatts. This is among the largest direct investments in renewable energy by a non-energy company.\\n\\nPowering all our facilities with 100% renewable energy.\\nSince 2018, 100 percent of the electricity we\\'ve used at our facilities has come from renewable sources. To secure renewable energy projects, we\\'ve taken on project ownership, made equity investments, sparked creative new partnerships with utilities, and entered into power purchase agreements. We\\'ve also deployed a variety of technologies like wind, solar PV, micro-hydro projects, and biogas fuel cells. (See Appendix B for a comprehensive view of solutions we\\'ve implemented to secure renewable energy at our facilities.)\\nWe first focus on energy efficiency to reduce the total electricity we use, then source renewables for our remaining needs. We create new renewable energy projects whenever possible. As of January 2019, approximately 66 percent of the renewable energy Apple uses comes from projects that Apple created. And we aim to soon cover our entire electricity load with Apple-created projects. We use three contracting structures to do this.\\n Direct ownership. Where feasible, we source our own renewable energy by building our own projects, including solar, wind, biogas fuel cells, and low-impact hydro projects.\\n Equity investment. In some markets, we invest capital to become part owner of new solar PV or wind projects and match that renewable generation with our energy use.\\n Long-term renewable energy contracts. At other times, we sign long-term contracts for renewable energy in order to support new, local projects that meet our robust renewable energy sourcing principles, primarily solar PV and wind projects.\\nIn cases where we need more renewable energy than what\\'s generated by our Apple-created projects, we directly purchase renewable energy from newer projects in nearby markets, or through available utility green energy programs. When these options are not available, we are willing to procure robust renewable energy credits (RECs) tied to recently constructed projects, applying the same rigor to these purchases as we do to our Apple-created renewables. When Apple acquires RECs, we require that they are Green-e Energy certified, where available, and come from the same power grid--and preferably in the same state or country--as the Apple facility they support.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 12\\n\\x0cHow we\\'re staying at 100%.\\nTo get to--and stay at--100 percent renewable energy for the electricity at our global facilities, we\\'ve implemented new approaches to securing renewable energy: We\\'ve expanded into new markets, we\\'re leveraging large projects to increase others\\' access to renewable energy, and we\\'re investing in projects without support of government subsidies.\\nNew markets.\\nSince 2017, we have been procuring renewable energy in new markets that we only recently entered or in which we have small loads--like India, Turkey, Israel, Brazil, Mexico, and Taiwan-- to cover our loads in those and neighboring countries. And as we continue to grow our global operations, we\\'ll continue building projects in new markets.\\nFor example, in Taiwan we worked with a local partner to build a rooftop PV system and secured a long-term contract for Apple to own the project\\'s renewable energy certificates. We will verify our purchase by using Taiwan\\'s newly created T-REC tracking system.\\nAggregation.\\nWe\\'re investing in large-scale renewable energy projects in the Great Lakes and mid-Atlantic regions totaling 245 megawatts of generation: an Illinois wind farm and a Virginia solar PV array. These projects will cover our electricity use at our retail stores and offices on the East Coast, as well as co-located data facilities in Chicago, Illinois, and Ashburn, Virginia. In addition, we\\'ve directly helped other companies access the same high-quality renewables that Apple is procuring. By working with others, we can help open the renewable energy market to companies of all sizes and accelerate the pace of new renewable generation.\\nSubsidy-free projects.\\nAs renewable energy markets around the world evolve and the technology becomes more cost-competitive, we\\'re looking to develop projects without the government subsidies that were designed to encourage development of renewable energy. This will enable us to retain ownership of the renewable energy credits of projects we invest in. In Denmark we contracted for a new wind farm and a 42-megawatt solar PV project--one of Denmark\\'s largest--using a commercially backed contract-for-difference power purchase agreement, the first of its kind in Denmark.\\nIn China, we\\'re working to create cost-competitive, subsidy-free renewable energy solutions for our facilities and suppliers.

As of April 2019, we already have commitments far exceeding our goal.\\n\\nLeading suppliers to switch to renewable energy.\\nApple also takes responsibility for the carbon emissions that occur in our supply chain. Manufacturing makes up 74 percent of our carbon footprint. Most of those emissions come from the electricity used to make the parts in our products. So we\\'re helping our suppliers reduce their energy use and transition to new renewable energy sources.\\nWe announced Apple\\'s Supplier Clean Energy Program in 2015, and we\\'ve seen enormous growth in just three years. In 2018, Apple and our suppliers invested in, or procured from, 1.9 gigawatts of operational clean energy that collectively generated 4.1 billion kWh. This clean energy generation avoided about 3.5 million metric tons of COe--roughly equivalent to the electricity needed to power over 600,000 homes in the U.S. for a year.14\\n\\nProgress toward 4 gigawatts\\n\\nApril 2017 April 2018 April 2019\\n\\nGoal: 4 GW by 2020\\n\\n0\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\nOperational (GW)\\n\\nCommitted (GW)\\n\\nTo ensure our program achieves the greatest positive impact, we have stringent social and environmental standards for supplier clean energy projects.

Initially, 10 suppliers and Apple will jointly invest nearly $300 million over the next four years.\\n\\nApple\\'s role.\\nApple supports supplier transitions to clean energy. We work with them to advocate for policy change in key markets. We connect suppliers with high-quality clean energy projects and developers. And we educate them on how they can take full advantage of the benefits of clean energy.\\nDemonstrating leadership.\\nThe transition to renewable energy can be highly complex. It often requires complicated deal structures across many regions, each with their own statutory and regulatory requirements. We gained invaluable experience by meeting our own 100 percent renewable energy goal in 43 countries, and we\\'re using that expertise to help develop nearly 500 megawatts of solar and wind projects in China and Japan. These projects are addressing upstream emissions in our supply chain as well as demonstrating our commitment to the Supplier Clean Energy Program.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 15\\n\\x0cEducating partners.\\nWe share our learnings with our supplier partners and help them plot their transition to renewable energy. In 2017, Apple developed the Clean Energy Portal, an online platform to help suppliers identify commercially viable renewable energy solutions in regions around the world. We continue to add new content, including policy guidance and financial analysis tools, intended to make adoption of clean energy in key markets even easier. Over 100 suppliers have registered for the site.\\nAdvocating for strong policy.\\nClean energy technology offers tremendous benefits to our suppliers, to electricity grids, and to countries. So we actively support policies that create cost-effective renewable energy markets, and we work closely with suppliers to engage local, regional, and national governments. This encourages the development of policies that support scalable renewable energy solutions.\\n\\n\"The Supplier Clean Energy Program is at the center of Apple\\'s commitment to making world-class products with greener manufacturing.

We think about how to make them powerful while using as little energy as possible. We use materials efficiently, and we source from materials that have a low-carbon profile.\\nDesigning our products to use less energy.\\nEnergy efficient products not only maximize battery life, but they\\'re better for the environment, too. We establish aggressive efficiency targets early in the design phase, and we consistently outperform ENERGY STAR, which sets the standard across commercial products in the U.S. In the last 10 years, we\\'ve decreased average product energy use by 70 percent across all Apple\\'s major product lines.4 For example, the 11-inch iPad Pro introduced in fall 2018 is 69 percent more efficient than the ENERGY STAR standard. MacBook Air with Retina display consumes three times less power in sleep mode than the previous-generation MacBook Air. When you multiply these reductions by all the Apple devices in the world, the impact on our carbon footprint really adds up.\\n69%\\nThe 11-inch iPad Pro models are more than 69 percent more efficient than the ENERGY STAR standard.\\n40%\\niMac Pro consumes 40 percent less power during sleep and off mode--the result of an innovation in power supply design.15\\n3X\\nMacBook Air with Retina display consumes three times less power in sleep than the previous-generation MacBook Air.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 18\\n\\x0cLowering impact by design.\\nOur carbon footprint tells us which components are carbon intensive, so we know where to focus our efforts. We reduce the amount of material we need to make certain components by changing the design and re-engineering manufacturing processes. And by sourcing from recycled or renewable materials, we can often further decrease the carbon emissions from certain components.\\nIntegrated circuits, or chips, make up a large portion of our manufacturing carbon footprint. Turning a silicon wafer into an integrated circuit is an energy-intensive process. So we seek out ways to reduce the amount of silicon used in chips, while maximizing their performance. The A11 and A12 chips used in iPhone 8, X, XS, XS Max, and XR allow more processing power to be packed into smaller silicon dies, which reduced Apple\\'s 2018 carbon footprint by 160,000 metric tons.\\nThe carbon footprint of aluminum enclosures of MacBook computers has been steadily decreasing since 2015--for some products, it\\'s over six times less. We\\'ve done this by sourcing aluminum from hydro-powered smelters, improving the material efficiency of manufacturing processes, and increasing recycled content in our products. And by using 100 percent recycled aluminum for the enclosure of the new MacBook Air with Retina display, we cut the product\\'s carbon footprint in half.\\n\\nPaving the way for carbon-free aluminum smelting\\n\\nAluminum is a key material in many of Apple\\'s products, and, for more than 130 years, it\\'s been produced through a carbon-intensive process. Through a partnership with aluminum manufacturers Alcoa Corporation and Rio Tinto Aluminum, announced in May 2018, that\\'s changing. The joint venture between Alcoa and Rio Tinto will commercialize patented technology that eliminates direct greenhouse gas emissions from the traditional smelting process, a key step in aluminum production. This is a revolutionary advancement in the manufacturing of one of the world\\'s most widely used metals.\\nAs part of Apple\\'s commitment to reducing the environmental impact of its products through innovation, the company helped accelerate the development of this technology. And Apple has partnered with both aluminum companies, and the governments of Canada and Quebec, to collectively invest a combined $144 million to future research and development.\\n\\nThe world\\'s first aluminum produced through a carbon-free smelting process.\\n\\n\"Apple is committed to advancing technologies that are good for the planet and help protect it for generations to come. We are proud to be part of this ambitious new project, and look forward to one day being able to use aluminum produced without direct greenhouse gas emissions in the manufacturing of our products.\"\\nTim Cook\\nApple\\'s CEO\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 19\\n\\x0c8 million sq. ft.\\nIn fiscal year 2018, we implemented energy efficiency measures in more than 8 million square feet of Apple facilities, with a combined annual electricity use of over 350 million kWh--resulting in an average energy savings of about 12 percent. In the past two years, we have made energy efficiency improvements to 17 million square feet.\\n\\nEnergy Efficiency\\nThe cleanest energy is the energy you never use.\\nEven as we\\'re aggressively transitioning to renewable energy at our corporate facilities and in our supply chain, we prioritize energy efficiency. When we use less energy, we have less to procure from clean sources.\\nTo increase energy efficiency at our Apple\\'s offices, data centers, and retail stores, we start with designing buildings to optimize energy use. For existing buildings at our facilities and in our supply chain, we conduct energy efficiency audits to identify system improvements that could reduce energy use.\\nA more energy efficient Apple.\\nIn 2018, we have continued to expand our energy efficiency programs to data centers, retail stores, offices, and R&D facilities located around the world. This past year, we have opened new buildings on Apple campuses in Cork, Ireland; Hyderabad, India; and Shenzhen, China. Each of these buildings exemplifies Apple\\'s commitment to energy efficiency with measures such as efficient HVAC systems with optimized air distribution, heat recovery, and radiant cooling; rooftop solar thermal; and occupancy controlled efficient lighting throughout.\\nWe also implemented a program within the past year to significantly reduce the energy consumption of new retail stores worldwide. We\\'re creating energy models during the design process to benchmark energy use and using those models to evaluate specific efficiency measures. The result is energy savings of approximately 10 to 30 percent, thanks to more thoughtful design and selection of building envelope components, lighting, and HVAC systems, as well as controlling all of these systems as efficiently as possible.\\nIn fiscal year 2018, we reduced our energy use by an additional 42 million kWh and 150,000 therms--a significant increase in energy savings compared to last year, due to the expansion of our program. Combined with ongoing energy savings from past years, we are now cumulatively saving over 113 million kWh of electricity and 2.5 million therms of natural gas per year, which corresponds to avoiding 43,199 metric tons of CO2e from entering the atmosphere.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 20\\n\\x0cA more energy efficient supply chain.\\nIn 2015, we started engaging directly with suppliers to help them reduce their energy use. We aim to educate them about energy efficiency, identify energy efficiency project opportunities, and manage those projects to completion. We prioritize facilities with the highest energy use and potential for improvement. Then we conduct energy audits and train suppliers to uncover opportunities for energy efficiency--like replacing outdated or inefficient heating, cooling, and lighting systems; repairing compressed air leaks; and recovering waste heat. The assessments provide suppliers with a cost-benefit analysis for implementing energy efficiency improvements.\\nSince the inception of this program in 2015, we have engaged 59 suppliers at 85 facilities. In 2018, our program implemented energy efficiency measures that prevented 466,000 metric tons of COe from entering the atmosphere.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 21\\n\\x0cDaisy, Apple\\'s line of disassembly robots, can now disassemble 15 models of iPhone, recovering more of the important materials stored inside.\\n\\nResources\\nPutting the planet\\'s limited materials to good use.

And when our customers return products through Apple Trade In, we make sure the materials in those devices are used again and again.\\nOur strategy is to create circular supply chains and reduce our impact on the planet\\'s resources by:  Designing and building products and packaging with recycled and renewable materials,\\nand using materials more efficiently.

Learn more >\\n\\nSourcing recycled and renewable materials.\\nWe aim to end our reliance on mining. That\\'s why we are transitioning to recycled16 and renewable materials, and maximizing material efficiency, all while maintaining the exceptional quality and finish of our final products.\\nWith such a broad ambition, we needed a robust, data-driven way to determine where to start. So we assessed 45 elements and raw materials based on their environmental, social, and supply impacts. The resulting Material Impact Profiles helped us identify a short list of materials on which to focus first. And we continue to use these profiles to determine which materials to tackle next.\\nEach material requires a different solution. For some, like rare earth elements, recycled material is not widely available. So simply understanding the barriers to recovery requires significant exploration, and the learning represents meaningful progress. For other materials, like tin, recycled material markets are more robust. So we piloted uses of recycled tin in select applications and brought them to scale. Throughout these explorations and across many materials, we\\'ve deepened our relationships with downstream recyclers. And we\\'ve partnered with suppliers further upstream to use fewer materials and find alternative, recycled sources.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 26\\n\\x0cAluminum\\nTo use 100 percent recycled aluminum, we had to invent a whole new kind. Standard recycled aluminum accumulates impurities each time it\\'s recycled. So we engineered an alloy that can accommodate scrap sources of aluminum and delivers the same strength, durability, and flawless finish. We use sophisticated computational models to identify an alloy chemistry that can withstand a countless number of recycling loops. Our own products and processes are a valuable source of aluminum scrap for our custom alloy, including iPhone enclosures recovered by Daisy. In fall 2018, we introduced MacBook Air and Mac mini models with 100 percent recycled aluminum enclosures. And use of recycled materials helped cut the carbon footprint of each product nearly in half. In 2019, these efforts will allow us to avoid mining more than 900,000 metric tons of aluminum-bearing bauxite.\\nCobalt17\\nWe use cobalt primarily in batteries. A limited supply of recycled cobalt is available on the market for use in batteries like ours, not because recyclers lack the ability to recover cobalt, but because many recyclers don\\'t have enough scrap sources, like batteries. So we set out to find new sources of scrap for our recyclers, starting with our own supply chain. We began sending iPhone batteries recovered from Daisy, Apple\\'s iPhone disassembly robot, to our upstream recycler in Apple\\'s battery supply chain. And after a successful pilot program, select battery and final assembly suppliers now send Apple\\'s battery scrap to our recycler upstream. Recycled cobalt from both scrap sources is being recycled into the batteries of new Apple products--a true circular supply chain.\\nCopper\\nAs a highly conductive metal, copper is used to make our printed circuit boards, cables, and connectors. We\\'re engaging with our suppliers to investigate new methods to manufacture our printed circuit boards in a way that uses less copper. For the copper we do use, we are moving to recycled sources. We are currently certifying the recycled copper content in the printed circuit boards of select iPhone models and estimate that the recycled copper used for these products represents over 60,000 metric tons of mined ore. To increase our contribution to recycled material streams, Daisy now liberates seven different components from which copper can be recovered, including the main logic board and the camera. And we\\'re directing these components to recyclers and smelters that can recover copper at high rates.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 27\\n\\x0cGlass\\nFor glass, we\\'re focused on material efficiency and recovery. We\\'re working with our cover glass suppliers to ensure that all glass scrap generated during the manufacturing process is recycled at the highest level possible. Glass is incredibly sensitive to impurities and changes in composition--even the production of new devices introduces impurities--so maintaining the quality is essential for recycling glass.\\nGold18\\nGold is already recovered at high rates due to its value. We\\'re continuing to identify ways to reduce the amount of gold we use in the plating of components like our printed circuit boards. In iPhone XS, for example, gold represents less than 0.01 percent of the overall product mass. We\\'re working within the complex gold supply chain in order to increase the use of certified recycled gold.\\nPaper\\nWe\\'ve successfully created a closed-loop, circular supply chain for paper. For the second year in a row, 100 percent of the wood fiber in our packaging was either from recycled sources or from responsibly managed forests or controlled wood sources. And to ensure we\\'re not taking away from the world\\'s supply of responsibly sourced paper, for the third year in a row, we are protecting or creating enough sustainably managed forests to cover all the wood fiber we use in our packaging.\\nPlastics\\nWe\\'ve first focused on using less plastic through material efficiency. For example, we re-designed the way plastic was injected into the mold of a high-volume part in iPhone XS and iPhone XR, cutting the scrap produced by one-third. For the plastic we do use, we\\'re looking for renewable or recycled alternatives to fossil fuel-based plastics. However, we use vast numbers of distinct grades of plastic, each designed to meet specific requirements. We are systematically exploring and qualifying recycled and renewable alternatives for each grade, so that whatever type of plastic a product needs, we will have a recycled or renewable option. So far, we\\'ve identified recycled alternatives for 24 different grades of plastic, allowing us to use an average of 38 percent recycled plastic across 82 components for products released this year. In our packaging, we\\'re working to eliminate the need for plastics altogether, and we have reduced plastic in our product packaging almost by half in three years.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 28\\n\\x0cRare earth elements\\nElements like neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium are used in magnets for audio applications, in cameras, and in haptics technology. Traditional recyclers don\\'t recover these rare earth elements, because they are used in small quantities and technology has not advanced sufficiently to recover them. However, Daisy recovers the small components that contain rare earth elements from iPhone. By consolidating these sources, we\\'re creating an opportunity for new technology to efficiently recover these materials.\\nSteel\\nOur primary use of stainless steel is in the enclosure of iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, and in some Apple Watch models. We\\'re working with our suppliers to increase and certify the recycled content in the stainless steel we source. And we\\'ve updated Daisy to recover the steel from iPhone enclosures and bands, which we then send to recyclers who are able to recover this highly recyclable material.\\nTin18\\nA market supply of recycled tin exists, but we need to make sure it meets our quality standards. In 2017, we proved we could use 100 percent recycled tin for the solder on the main logic board--where the majority of tin is found--of iPhone 6s. We\\'re now specifying 100 percent recycled tin for the solder of the main logic boards of seven subsequent iPhone models plus the newly released MacBook Air with Retina display, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Using recycled tin in Apple devices will prevent us from mining almost 29,000 metric tons of tin ore in 2019. But we want to recover as much tin as we\\'re using--and make sure the tin is recycled and put back into the world\\'s supply. Unfortunately, tin is not recovered by all electronics recyclers. So we\\'re prioritizing recyclers that recover tin, in addition to copper and precious metals, from the main logic boards and camera modules retrieved by Daisy.\\nTungsten18\\nTraditional recyclers shred products to quickly break them down. Though shredding makes separation easier, it can cause the recycler to lose many materials, like tungsten. That\\'s why we designed Daisy as an alternative to whole unit shredding. Daisy is able to separate out the Taptic Engine, which we send to speciality recyclers that recover tungsten from it. We\\'re also working with our suppliers to certify the use of recycled tungsten in our products.\\nLithium, tantalum,18 and zinc\\nAs we\\'ve advanced in our work to create circular supply chains, we\\'ve expanded our program to include other materials in our products, using the Material Impact Profiles to guide us. We recently added lithium, tantalum, and zinc. And we\\'ve already begun exploring new recycled sources and prioritizing recyclers that can recover these key materials.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 29\\n\\x0ciPhone XS meets the IP68 international standard for dust and water resistance. That means it can withstand being submerged to a depth of 2 meters for up to 30 minutes.\\n\\nBuilt to last as long as humanly possible.\\nYou count on your device day after day. So we design our products with durable materials, support them with ongoing OS updates, and make them easy to get repaired if anything happens. Because the longer a device is in use, the better use we make of the Earth\\'s resources.\\nDurable by design.\\nWe design our products for durability. For example, we built iPhone XS to meet the IP68 international standard for dust and water resistance, which means the devices can withstand being submerged to a depth of 2 meters for up to 30 minutes. And we prove that recycled and renewable materials can also meet our standards. For example, the solder in the main logic board of iPhone is made with 100 percent recycled tin that performs every bit as well as newly mined tin.\\nIn our Reliability Testing Lab, we amplify real-world conditions to enhance the durability of our designs. We test your device\\'s ability to withstand mechanical stresses, such as a sudden impact with a hard surface. In climate tests, we pit our devices against extreme heat and cold, dry and humid conditions, and intense sun exposure. Our chemical sensitivity tests evaluate the ability of devices to stand up to accidental spills like coffee, soda, sunscreen, or ketchup. We often go beyond international standards, and sometimes even create our own.\\nWith these tests, we intentionally push our products beyond their limits so we can study what happens. We then use state-of-the-art equipment, such as CT scanners and electron microscopes, to thoroughly understand impacts to the microstructure. This information flows back to our designers and engineers to enable further durability improvements. We repeat this cycle through our product development process until our products meet our rigorous performance standards.\\niOS updates your older device with new capabilities.\\niOS has the best software update mechanism in the industry, bringing updates to more devices than anyone else.

Out of all devices using iOS--including those released many years ago--80 percent are using iOS 12.\\nBetter use of materials through repair.\\nWhen devices are repaired rather than replaced, we make better use of the materials in them. And we know even the most dependable products sometimes need service. That\\'s why we offer a network of more than 5,000 Apple Store locations and Apple Authorized Service Providers worldwide to provide safe, high-quality repairs. We offer battery replacement for all of our products--and we make sure the replaced batteries are recycled responsibly. Customers can access these repair locations in person or by mail. And we are continuing to expand our services.\\nTo make sure that repairs are performed safely, securely, and to the highest quality, we continuously train and certify service channel personnel, with over 265,000 active trained personnel. Our providers perform diagnostics and calibrations to target repairs precisely, avoiding unnecessary service and replacements of parts. When new parts are needed, only genuine Apple parts are used, so repaired devices work exactly the way they should. And all Apple-certified repairs are backed by Apple.\\nWe continue to expand access to high-quality and convenient repair options for our customers. Our new method for optimizing iPhone screen repairs has allowed thousands more independent shops to start offering this repair service.\\nWe offer a network of more than 5,000 retail stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers worldwide to repair devices so that they can be used longer.\\n\\n  Apple Authorized Service Providers Retail stores\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 31\\n\\x0cApple Trade In\\nTrade in your device for credit toward a new one, or recycle it responsibly for free.\\nWe work closely with our recycling partners to help make sure:  Privacy is protected.  Devices are recycled safely and\\nresponsibly.  Applicable regulations are followed. See how it works >\\nIn spring 2019, we are launching a program with Best Buy in the U.S. and KPN in the Netherlands so that eligible iPhones will be sent to our disassembly robot Daisy.\\n\\nTrade it in. Help the planet out.\\nEven when you\\'re done with your device, chances are it still has more to give to the world. Apple Trade In is a simple way to exchange your old device for credit so that it can be reused by a new owner. If it isn\\'t eligible for credit, we\\'ll recycle it free of charge.20 Either way, your trade-in helps reduce the amount of materials that need to be mined from the Earth. That\\'s a trade-off that works for everybody.\\nRefurbishing for a new life.\\nOur devices are built to last. That\\'s why they often go on to a second or even third user. Through Apple Trade In, customers in 27 countries can trade in their devices either online or in-store. For products that still have more to give, customers can receive an Apple Store Gift Card or a refund on their purchase. These devices are repaired when necessary and sent to their next owner. If a product is at the end of its life, we\\'ll recycle it for free. We also collect and refurbish used devices through our iPhone Upgrade Program, AppleCare, and, inside Apple, our Hardware Reuse Program for employees. Altogether, we directed 7,860,000 devices to new users in fiscal year 2018. Keeping these devices in use rather than needing to make new products to serve those customers resulted in tangible material and carbon emissions savings.\\nRecycling for material recovery.\\nAfter sourcing responsibly and creating long-lasting products, we focus next on recovering materials. We participate in and offer product collection and recycling programs in 99 percent of the countries in which we sell products.21 These programs recycle our products and other electronics, all for free. In fiscal year 2018, we helped divert more than 48,000 metric tons of electronic waste from landfills. And we continue to make these programs more accessible.\\nTo truly end our reliance on mining, we also need to better capture the materials inside the products we recover. We created our disassembly robot, Daisy, to remove and sort components, so we can recover more materials at a higher quality than traditional recyclers can. This year, we updated Daisy to disassemble six additional iPhone models--15 models in total--from iPhone 5 to iPhone XS. Even while identifying models in real-time and disassembling devices with greater variation, Daisy can take apart 200 iPhone devices per hour. In the U.S. and the Netherlands, Daisy is now processing end-of-life iPhone models returned to us through Apple Trade In and AppleCare.\\nSome of the recovered materials are already heading back into our supply chain for new products. Most of the aluminum recovered from iPhone, for example, became part of the 100 percent recycled aluminum enclosure of MacBook Air. And cobalt we recovered from the iPhone battery is used to make new Apple batteries. Because of our efforts to keep harmful substances out of our products, these materials are safer to recover and reuse.\\nFor some materials, however, efficient recycling technologies don\\'t exist. We don\\'t believe technology should be a barrier to conserving the Earth\\'s resources. That\\'s why we created our new Material Recovery Lab in Texas. The lab will focus on three key areas: optimizing existing recycling practices, improving the ability to disassemble devices, and advancing research and development of the next generation of recycling technologies. We aim to benefit the broader recycling industry through this research. After all, the more material that gets reused, the less that needs to be mined from the Earth.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 32\\n\\x0cComponents and materials Daisy recovers\\nMain Logic Board Tin Gold Copper Silver\\nReceiver Steel Copper Rare earth elements\\n\\nTaptic Engine Tungsten Rare earth elements Steel Copper\\n\\nWireless Charging Coil Gold Copper\\n\\nFor every 100,000 iPhone devices, Daisy has the potential to recover:*\\n\\nAluminum Gold Silver Rare earth elements Tungsten Copper Tin Cobalt Steel\\n\\n1,500 kg 1.1 kg 6.3 kg 32 kg 83 kg 1,000 kg 29 kg 790 kg 1,400 kg\\n\\nNew Enclosures (iPhone 8 and later)** Aluminum Copper Steel\\n\\nOld Enclosures (iPhone 7 and earlier) Aluminum Steel\\n\\nBattery Cobalt\\n\\nSpeaker Steel Copper Rare earth elements\\n\\nDock Flex Tin Gold Copper\\n\\nRear Camera Copper Tin Gold Rare earth elements\\n\\nFront Camera and Face ID Copper Tin Gold Steel\\n\\n* These quantities are based on an estimated product mix for what Daisy is likely to disassemble in the upcoming year, reflecting additional iPhone models.

The results are more beautiful than ever--for our packaging and for the planet.\\nCutting down on plastic.\\nIn three years, we\\'ve reduced our plastic use in U.S. product packaging by 48 percent. Starting with iPhone 7 and iPad Pro, we changed the plastic tray in the packaging to an all molded fiber alternative. This switch allowed us to also create iPhone XS and XR, iMac Pro, MacBook Air, iPad mini, and iPad Pro with majority-fiber packaging. And as of March 2019, we\\'ve transitioned to 100 percent fiber retail bags in all retail stores. These new bags even have a knitted paper handle and contain 80 percent recycled fiber.\\nUsing recycled and responsible sources.\\nWe aim to maximize the use of recycled paper in our packaging. In fiscal year 2018 we used 58 percent recycled paper, on average. When virgin paper is needed, we require our suppliers to source wood fiber from responsibly managed forests or Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) controlled wood sources.22 For the second year in a row, all of our packaging suppliers sourced their paper responsibly. And we conduct regular audits to ensure their claims.\\nOutside of packaging, less than 1 percent of our total fiber use is for our corporate offices--of which approximately 85 percent came from recycled or responsible sources in 2018.\\n\\nPackaging fiber and plastic footprint* (metric tons)\\n\\n37,000 21%\\n\\n34,000 21%\\n\\n24,000 14%\\n\\n19,000 10%\\n\\n2015 171,500\\n\\n2016 165,000\\n\\n53,000 31%\\n\\n81,500 48%\\n\\n50,000 30%\\n\\n81,000 49%\\n\\nPlastic\\n\\nRecycled fiber**\\n\\nVirgin fiber**\\n\\n* The packaging fiber and plastic footprint includes retail and shipping boxes. ** Beginning in FY18, we considered bagasse to be virgin fiber, instead of recycled fiber.\\n\\n2017 169,000\\n\\n51,000 30%\\n\\n94,000 56%\\n\\n2018 187,000\\n\\n60,000 32%\\n\\n108,000 58%\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 34\\n\\x0cOur journey to responsible packaging\\n\\nProtecting responsibly managed forests.\\nWe don\\'t just specify that all of our virgin fiber be sourced responsibly, we also want to make sure we\\'re not diminishing the world\\'s supply of responsible paper. For the third consecutive year, production from the responsibly managed forests we\\'ve protected or helped to improve exceeded the amount of virgin fiber we used in our product packaging.23\\nOne year early, we achieved our 2020 goal of transitioning one million acres of forest across China to improved management. This is part of our five-year partnership with World Wildlife Fund, which is focused on three primary objectives:\\n Increase responsible management of working forests in China--by creating up to 375,000 acres of FSC-certified forests. And improve the management of up to 640,000 acres.\\n Contribute to the improvement of China\\'s policy framework to encourage responsible forest management.\\n Help China establish long-term market incentives for responsibly sourced paper.\\nIn addition to improving the management of 1 million acres of forest directly, the project has the potential to influence millions more by supporting the development of the China Sustainable Plantation Management Guidelines. These guidelines, informed by our project and released by China\\'s National Forestry and Grassland Administration, have been selected by the national government for use in the National Reserve Forest Plan, which guides the management of more than 40 million acres of forest.\\nIn the U.S., we continue to partner with The Conservation Fund (TCF) and support its innovative Working Forest Fund model. Through this fund, TCF purchases threatened working forests, protects them into the future through conservation easements, then sells the protected forest to begin the process again. So far, we\\'ve protected 36,000 acres of forest in the Eastern United States that are now certified as sustainably managed. And when forests thrive, so do local communities and wildlife.\\n\\n48%\\nreduction in plastic use\\nin 2018, compared to 2015\\n\\n58%\\naverage recycled wood\\nfiber content\\n\\n100%\\nof wood fiber in our packaging\\ncomes from responsibly managed\\nforests\\n\\n100%\\nWe are protecting or creating enough responsibly managed forests to cover all of the virgin paper we use in our packaging\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 35\\n\\x0cZero Waste\\nFinding new ways to keep old materials out of landfills.\\nWe\\'re working to reuse, recycle, compost, or when necessary, convert into energy all the waste created by our own facilities and in our supply chain. Reaching this goal requires collaboration among multiple Apple teams, local governments, and specialty recyclers, and we\\'ve already seen great success.\\nA zero waste program for Apple facilities.\\nWe\\'re currently pursuing an ambitious goal of Zero Waste to Landfill at our more than 450 corporate facilities, our more than 500 retail stores, and our five data centers.24 Our first aim is to reduce the waste we generate by rethinking the materials we use--in areas from building renovations to food service. And for the waste we do create, we\\'re working to recover it to its highest and best use through robust composting, recycling, and reuse programs.\\nIn fiscal year 2018, we generated 74,000 metric tons of waste and diverted about 74 percent from landfill through recycling and composting, up 3 percentage points from fiscal year 2017. To reduce the waste we generate, we work with our upstream vendors to streamline materials used and select those designed with the environment in mind. For example, we set up new packaging standards for all of our data centers, eliminating unnecessary packaging and finding ways to reuse the packaging shipped. When we do create waste, we focus on managing it responsibly. In renovations across our hundreds of corporate facilities, nearly 85 percent of the furniture is recovered, repaired, and made available for reuse. And because lack of data is one of the biggest obstacles to managing waste well, we installed remote monitoring systems that allow us to identify problem areas and resolve them quickly and accurately.\\nAcross facilities that generate hazardous waste, Apple takes great strides to ensure it is managed responsibly. We complete regular audits of the Transportation, Storage, and Disposal Facilities (TSDFs) where hazardous waste is ultimately sent to be treated, recycled, or incinerated. Only facilities we audit are allowed to accept and treat the hazardous waste Apple generates. We take this commitment seriously--if any TSDF does not meet our strict standards for environment, health, safety, and waste management protocols, we send waste to an alternate, approved facility.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 36\\n\\x0c1 million metric tons\\nThrough our supplier Zero Waste Program, we\\'ve diverted enough waste to cover more than 4,000 soccer fields 1 meter deep.\\n\\nA zero waste program for our suppliers.\\nIn 2015, we launched a Zero Waste Program for suppliers, which provides them with onsite support to recycle and reuse materials. The aim is to divert 100 percent of waste from landfills. We provide tools and guidance, including the services of experts in sustainable waste management.\\nInitially we prioritized suppliers with the most significant waste impact: final assembly facilities where components from all over the world come together to be assembled into Apple products. Our goal was to help these facilities drastically reduce the waste they send to landfill. And in 2018, we achieved UL\\'s Zero Waste to Landfill certification for all final assembly facilities across iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, AirPods, and HomePod.25 This includes the Appleoperated final assembly site in Cork, Ireland, which was the first Apple facility to receive the designation from UL.\\nWe\\'ve since expanded our efforts further upstream in our supply chain to include sub-assembly suppliers. However, the deeper we go, the more complex the waste streams become. So we are looking for new technological innovations, exploring up-cycling techniques to reuse by-products, and even reassessing manufacturing processes.\\nIn 2018, we diverted 375,000 metric tons of waste from landfills. And to date, we\\'ve engaged 90 suppliers and diverted more than 1 million metric tons of waste--enough to cover more than 4,000 soccer fields a meter deep.\\nWater Stewardship\\nProtecting Earth\\'s most precious resource.\\nWater supports all life on Earth. And while water itself is plentiful, only a small fraction is available to those who need it. The scarcity of freshwater continues to increase, a trend exacerbated by climate change. So we hold ourselves accountable for the water we use, whether at our corporate offices, data centers, distribution centers, and retail stores, or at our suppliers\\' facilities around the globe.\\nHow we\\'re tackling our water footprint.\\nWater is necessary to operate our corporate facilities, including for cooling at our data centers. At our manufacturing facilities, suppliers use water for processes like etching, cutting, cleaning, and cooling. So we work to conserve it and be smarter about the water we do use. We focus both on improving water use in our facilities and--through our Clean Water Program--helping our suppliers conserve water and prevent water pollution. And we are engaging communities where we operate and manufacture products to make sure shared water resources are protected and accessible. We\\'re proud of the progress we\\'ve made, but we know there\\'s still work to do.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 37\\n\\x0cWe mapped our global water use to different levels of water risk. As a result, we\\'re focused on three locations with elevated water risk--Maiden, North Carolina; Mesa, Arizona; and Santa Clara Valley, California--where 52 percent of our total use occurs.\\n\\nTo continue to improve our water use by our facilities and our suppliers, we focus on:\\n Using water efficiently to reduce overall use.  Identifying alternative water sources, such as recycled and reclaimed water.  Discharging water responsibly to prevent pollution.  Expanding our water stewardship to keep watersheds healthy for all who rely on them.\\nWater resources are extremely local. That\\'s why we focus on areas where our efforts can have the largest positive impact. We map our global water use against water quality, quantity, and regulatory factors to understand which regions have an elevated risk. We then prioritize those locations based on how much water we`re using. We continually update our risk assessment based on new data and better understanding of the regional environments in which we are operating. And when engaging with suppliers, we put a special emphasis on working with those with high water usage, the potential for poor discharge quality, and facilities in waterstressed regions. Working with suppliers is key, as early assessments show that manufacturing represents the majority of our water footprint.26\\nUsing water efficiently.\\nWater is essential to the work we do. However, we aim to minimize the water used by our facilities and our suppliers\\' operations, especially in areas of elevated water risk. And by continuing to expand our reduction efforts, we aim to improve our footprint over time.\\nIn fiscal year 2018, Apple used about 1.26 billion gallons of water directly, a 26 percent increase over the previous year. This increase was driven largely by growth in a few locations, and by increased visibility into temporary water use. These temporary uses accounted for 140 million gallons of water in 2018, and include things like dust control for new construction and the establishment of mature, drought-tolerant trees in landscaping.\\nWater use at Apple facilities We track our corporate water use for our data centers, retail stores, and corporate offices.\\n\\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2018\\n\\n0\\n\\n300\\n\\n600\\n\\n900\\n\\n1200\\n\\n1500\\n\\nMillions of gallons\\n\\nFreshwater use\\n\\nRecycled water use\\n\\nTemporary freshwater use\\n\\nBeginning in fiscal year 2017, our boundary expanded to include more than 150 million gallons of water used annually at distribution centers and co-located data centers.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 38\\n\\x0c5X\\nincrease in total water savings from the Clean Water Program in two years\\n\\nOur water footprint shows us that we need to continue to reduce our water demand. This year, a number of different water efficiency efforts helped minimize our freshwater use. We designed our latest data centers buildings in Maiden, North Carolina; Reno, Nevada; Viborg, Denmark; and China to use 80 percent less water for cooling than at previous data centers. In our retail stores, our newly launched back-of-store, or \"backstage,\" design includes low-flow fixtures that save up to 30 percent more water compared with our previous design. And at our corporate offices in Santa Clara Valley, our landscape efficiency program continues to reduce our outdoor water use--by more than 15.3 million gallons per year--through turf replacement and irrigation system upgrades. Around the world, our pursuit of water efficient design is expected to save more than 90 million gallons of water per year.\\nThrough our supplier Clean Water Program, we help those who make our products improve their water use by performing baseline assessments, providing technical support on watersaving improvements, and monitoring progress. Our suppliers conserved 7.6 billion gallons of water across 116 facilities in 2018, bringing the total cumulative savings to 21 billion gallons since 2013. These savings were achieved through diverse initiatives including installation of low-flow fixtures, use of meters to control consumption, and employee education. And since many of our suppliers also build components for other companies, we\\'re reducing the water footprint of non-Apple products, too.\\nFinding alternative sources.\\nAs we work to minimize our overall water use, we also look to alternative sources to help reduce freshwater withdrawals, including recycled water, reclaimed water, and harvested rainwater.\\nAcross our facilities, use of recycled water worldwide grew from 24 million gallons to 63 million gallons in fiscal year 2018. This reflects recycled water use in two of our three largest co-located data centers as well as offices in Elk Grove, Singapore, and India. We have also made significant investments to bring recycled water to our campuses in Santa Clara Valley, an effort that will replace over 30 million gallons of potable freshwater a year.\\nCaptured rainwater represents another alternative source of water for our facilities. In 2018, we captured and reused 4 million gallons of rainwater for cooling, irrigation, and construction needs at our Maiden, North Carolina, data center, and at our corporate offices in Cork, Ireland, and Yokohama, Japan. And our newest retail location, Apple Champs-lyses, features a rainwater collection system which can collect up to 1,800 gallons of water a day. This system will reduce potable freshwater use by 15 percent per year at the store.\\nWhen we engage suppliers, we also focus on ways to reclaim and reuse water. We look for creative sources of water to reclaim, including condensation from centralized air conditioning. For water reuse, even simple solutions can be highly impactful. For example, we encourage the re-use of the water used to wash products in-between production stages. As they are rinsed, products are moved from tub to tub of water, and as they do so, both the device and water gets cleaner. Simply moving rinse water in the opposite direction of the devices as it gets dirtier, rather than dumping it, allows the same rinse water to be reused two to three times. With solutions both simple and complex, we\\'ve increased the average water reuse to 39 percent across suppliers.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 39\\n\\x0cWater Treatment Manager at a Clean Water Program facility for packaging manufacturing, China.\\n\\nDischarging water responsibly.\\nManaging wastewater discharge is also an important way to conserve water resources in a watershed.\\nAt our Santa Clara Valley campus, we\\'re implementing an onsite wastewater treatment system that will treat approximately 550,000 gallons per year of water onsite and return it to the municipal wastewater system. And at our data centers in Prineville, Oregon, and Reno, Nevada, our teams have been deploying a mineral filter media that allows us to recapture more of the water we use in cooling, reducing water discharge by up to 30 percent.\\nOur Supplier Code of Conduct includes standards for wastewater discharge quality, and we regularly audit for compliance with these high standards. Our Clean Water Program engagement goes beyond compliance to help our suppliers build world-class water management systems. We target supplier sites based on water discharge risk and launch intensive, multi-year engagements. We begin with a comprehensive assessment that leads to targeted improvements, including installation of improved infrastructure, use of cutting-edge wastewater treatment technologies, and the creation of systems for validating discharge. Throughout the program, we engage deeply to create cultural change and promote greater water literacy.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 40\\n\\x0cPursuing water stewardship.\\nWater connects communities. It\\'s also essential for human health and thriving ecosystems. So we look beyond our own operations to restore water resources in critical regions and ensure that local communities have water access.\\nIn Prineville, Oregon, we created a water supply solution to meet the needs of Apple\\'s local data center and the broader community for years to come. We partnered with the City of Prineville to build an aquifer storage and recovery system, which uses natural underground spaces to costeffectively store water throughout the year for use in peak demand months. With a storage capacity of up to 180 million gallons--significantly more than we use for our data center--the system also helps mitigate future climate-related risks of water shortages.\\nApple and our suppliers have also partnered with the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS), a collaboration between businesses and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), in a program to support water management beyond the factory and into the community. We\\'ve launched a pilot project with five suppliers in the Kunshan region of China, an area with a cluster of electronics suppliers that is experiencing water-quality challenges. These five suppliers aim to meet the AWS global standards, which promote effective water management and safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) for local communities. Already, two Apple suppliers have received AWS certification, including the first Gold certification ever to be awarded in the electronics industry. And we plan to expand our supplier stewardship program to improve water quality at other sites like the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 41\\n\\x0cApple Champs-lyses is expected to receive a BREEAM \"Very Good\" green building rating.

We actively apply green building principles to all of our offices, data centers, and retail stores around the world.\\nWherever possible, we pursue green building certifications like U.S. Green Building Council\\'s LEED certification and the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM). Apple Park, our new headquarters in Cupertino, is on track to be the largest LEED Platinum-certified office building in North America. When we constructed our Hollyhill building at our campus in Cork, it was one of only six in Ireland to be awarded an \"Excellent\" rating by BREEAM. And our data center in Viborg, Denmark, is LEED Gold certified--as are buildings at our data centers in Reno, Nevada; Maiden, North Carolina; Mesa, Arizona; and Prineville, Oregon.\\nAt our retail stores, we also apply green building principles to reduce our demand on the environment, while providing healthier spaces for our customers to experience our products. When we renovated a historic building on the Avenue des Champs-lyses for our new retail location, we installed environmental features like high-efficiency lighting systems, rainwater collection, and onsite PV panels, which are expected to earn the building a rating of \"Very Good\" from BREEAM. Our newly launched back-of-store design for retail locations reduces energy load by 40 percent and is made of recycled materials, including insulation made with 80 percent post-consumer recycled denim. More than 50 stores have already been built with this design. We have also committed to sourcing only Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified materials for all tables, benches, and wood fixtures in all new retail stores--nearly 150 locations and hundreds of tables in 2018 alone. FSC only certifies wood made from forests that protect water resources, promote biodiversity, and enhance the lives of workers and local communities.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 42\\n\\x0cSince 2017, 100 percent of supplier assembly sites have adopted safer cleaners and degreasers with our help.\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\nMaking products as safe as they are sound.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 43\\n\\x0cSmarter Chemistry\\n\\n45\\n\\nOur Approach\\n\\n46\\n\\nMapping and Engagement\\n\\n46\\n\\nAssessment and Management\\n\\n48\\n\\nChemistry Innovation\\n\\nMaterials are what make products faster, tougher, and more beautiful.

Our approach begins with collecting comprehensive chemical composition information for the substances used to make our products as well as the process chemicals, like cleaners and degreasers, suppliers apply when making our products. We use this information to evaluate supplier compliance with the Apple Regulated Substances Specification (RSS)--our own set of global chemicals restrictions that goes beyond regulatory requirements and is based on best industry practices or toxicology properties. We go even further by using the chemical composition information we\\'ve collected in order to assess the hazard and risk of unregulated substances. And if we ever identify a substance that needs replacement, we innovate with our suppliers to find safer alternatives.\\n\\nOur approach to smarter chemistry\\n\\nMapping and engagement Create a comprehensive inventory of chemicals used by suppliers to make our products\\n\\nAssessment and management\\nAssess and manage chemicals for risks to\\nhuman health and environment\\n\\nInnovation Transition to safer chemistries through chemical innovations, beyond what is required\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 45\\n\\x0cGRE\\n\\nE N\\n\\nENSCRE\\nWe screen our materials with comprehensive risk assessment tools, including GreenScreen, which evaluates substances against 18 different hazards, including carcinogens, mutagens, and endocrine disruptors.\\n\\nMapping and Engagement\\nWe\\'re exhaustively mapping materials in our products.\\nEvaluating the chemicals in the tens of thousands of components used in our products is an enormous task, but it\\'s essential to our commitment to customer safety. It starts with creating an extensive inventory of chemicals used to make them. That means collecting information not just from our suppliers, but from their suppliers, too. We\\'re working closely with our partners to construct a detailed map of every chemical inside our materials, including many of the chemicals used to manufacture them.\\nWe go beyond what\\'s required by law to eliminate harmful chemicals from our products. In 2016, we launched the Full Material Disclosure (FMD) program, an ambitious initiative aimed at helping us more comprehensively understand the chemical composition of every substance in every part of our products. This can be challenging because it requires that suppliers disclose proprietary information. We overcome this by storing the data securely and limiting access to a select number of people within Apple who are responsible for toxicological assessments. We prioritize materials with the greatest risks, such as those used in high quantities or those with the greatest human exposure. We collect detailed chemical information for tens of thousands of components and over 75 percent of product mass for new iPhone, iPad, and Mac products. We won\\'t stop until we rigorously understand the chemistry of every material.\\nIn 2015, we went a step further by creating an inventory of chemicals that are used at supplier facilities but don\\'t reside in the products. We mapped the process chemicals used in our final assembly facilities and evaluated all control measures such as ventilation, personal protective equipment, and worker training programs. The mapping resulted in the further identification-- and continued replacement--of potentially harmful substances that required controls and personal protective equipment from cleaners at final assembly sites.\\nAssessment and Management\\nWe evaluate chemicals for risks to your health, and the planet\\'s.\\nIn 2002, we introduced the RSS, which identifies the harmful chemicals we limit or prohibit in our manufacturing processes and products. In 2006, we built our own Environmental Testing Lab, where our chemists look for any potentially harmful substances and test products to evaluate compliance with the RSS. Since the lab\\'s opening, we have expanded it to more than 30 times its original size and have regularly updated it with state-of-the-art equipment--like an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, liquid and gas chromatography mass spectrometers, and a laser-induced breakdown spectrometer similar to the one used by NASA. We even manufacture artificial sweat to simulate human exposure and evaluate the safety of our materials that come into contact with skin.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 46\\n\\x0cAt Apple\\'s onsite environmental testing lab, chemists assess products for harmful chemicals.\\n\\nWith information collected from the environmental testing laboratory, and the FMD and chemical mapping programs, we can then generate comprehensive toxicology assessments. This includes GreenScreen, which considers 18 criteria to help us understand the materials\\' effects on people\\'s health and the environment. We also have inhouse, board-certified toxicologists who use lab testing and computer modeling to create toxicological profiles that previously didn\\'t exist--addressing a major challenge in this field. Only materials that pass our rigorous review process are accepted for our products.\\nWe\\'re just as committed to the safety of the people who make our products. We require our suppliers to follow the standards set in our RSS. In 2014, we launched our Chemical Management Program to help suppliers develop a comprehensive approach to managing chemicals safely. The program, which has grown to 113 participating supplier facilities, enables our partners to shift to safer chemicals and improve general safety, awareness, and training. And to help drive toward safer chemicals, we map chemicals use and screen them using GreenScreen to assess the safety of cleaners and degreasers used at supplier final assembly facilities.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 47\\n\\x0c100%\\nSince 2015, 100 percent of the process chemicals used at our supplier final assembly facilities complied with Apple\\'s Regulated Substances Specification.\\n\\nChemistry Innovation\\nInventing ways to replace bad substances with good ones.\\nWe\\'re continually evaluating the materials used in our products and design to avoid harmful substances altogether. We seek to reduce and remove toxins, by developing new, safer chemistries. When there is not an existing alternative to a chemical we\\'ve determined harmful, we innovate. We work with our suppliers to develop custom chemistries made with safer substances. To find a replacement for PVC and phthalates, for example, we and our suppliers invested in four years of research and development to create power cords and headphone cables that had both the performance and chemistry that met Apple standards.27 This deep commitment to innovating on safer chemistries sets Apple apart from many others who still use PVC and phthalates in their cables.\\nWe began to identify and phase out harmful substances in the late 1990s, beginning with PVC in our packaging, and moving on to the lead that was in our display glass and solder.28 Since then, we\\'ve also replaced mercury displays with energy efficient and mercury-free LEDs and OLEDs; eliminated arsenic from display glass;29 replaced brominated flame retardants from thousands of parts such as enclosures, cables, circuit boards, and connectors, using safer metal hydroxides and phosphorus compounds in their place;30 and eliminated beryllium-copper connectors and springs from all new product designs.\\nWe\\'re also focused on replacing harmful substances in manufacturing process chemicals to keep workers in our supply chain safe. We have long been engaging with our manufacturing partners to ensure safe working conditions. After analyzing the chemical composition of cleaners and degreasers used at supplier final assembly sites, we chose to go a step further and replace all identified hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives such as ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, glycerol, and water. In our first year of this Safer Cleaner Substitution program, we helped 18 sites replace 24 problematic formulations.31 In addition, in 2018, we added n-Propyl Bromide (nPB) to our RSS list of banned process chemicals for cleaning and degreasing. These efforts seek to avoid use of harmful chemicals, which protects the people who make, use, and recycle our products and keeps pollutants out of the land, air, and water.\\nWe removed PVC and phthalates from all our power cords, headphones, and cables.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 48\\n\\x0cA timeline of smarter chemistry\\nOur program initially moved beyond a strictly compliance focus in the late 1990s, when we started to phase out PVC from our packaging.

So we listen. We speak. We convene. We advocate. We lead. We learn. And we engage at all levels: locally, nationally, and internationally; and with policymakers, researchers, non-governmental organizations, other companies, and our customers. Every conversation, every meeting, and every presentation brings us closer to unlocking more environmental innovations that we--and others--can apply. Because bold ideas and creative solutions can emerge anywhere, from anyone, at any time.\\nMore partnerships. More progress.\\nWe work with a wide range of nonprofit, industry, government, and business partners from across the globe. We\\'ve built strong relationships with a broad group of stakeholders, including those who might disagree with our approach. We do this because we believe that addressing their concerns often leads to better solutions. Exposing ourselves to varied perspectives helps us challenge our assumptions and refine our methods. That\\'s critical when you\\'re pursuing a vision that\\'s as bold and complex as ours: to one day make products without taking from the Earth.\\nJoining industry associations allows us to work closely with some of the best companies across all sectors. Our memberships in organizations like the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), World Economic Forum\\'s Platform for Accelerating Circular Economy, Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Aluminum Stewardship Initiative, Ceres, Corporate Eco Forum, the Chinese Association of Circular Economy, Digital Europe--and most recently, the Japan Climate Leaders Partnership--provide us the opportunity to exchange ideas with those who share our commitment to a more sustainable future.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 51\\n\\x0cLisa Jackson speaks at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union about the role of the private sector in spurring smart, innovative environmental action.

We also collaborated with Tsinghua University\\'s School of Public Policy and Management on its Summer Institute for China\\'s Green Innovators (SICGI) program. In the past three years, 112 students from 50 universities joined the program to identify creative policy solutions to environmental challenges through course training and internships with local environment agencies.\\nTo support our Smarter Chemistry work, in 2015, we formed a Green Chemistry Advisory Board, made up of some of the world\\'s leading toxicologists, researchers, and academics. The board helps us explore innovative ways to minimize or eliminate toxins from our supply chain and to incorporate the latest breakthroughs in green chemistry into our products and processes.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 52\\n\\x0cCustomer engagement.\\nWe seek to engage customers in our environmental mission, giving them opportunities to join in our efforts. In the past three years, we have launched two customer-facing campaigns: Apps for Earth; and communications around the benefits of returning devices to Apple for trade-in or recycling.\\nApps for Earth was a 2016 partnership with app developers and customers that generated over $8 million to support World Wildlife Fund\\'s global environmental projects. As of November 2018, World Wildlife Fund has fully invested the funds raised in conservation projects spanning all seven continents. These projects have helped protect wildlife through improved tracking, increase access to freshwater in vulnerable communities, promote sustainable food production and consumption, improve community management of forests, use technology to advance ocean conservation, and build resilience in ecosystems threatened by climate change.\\nFor every device received through Apple Trade In during a two-week period around Earth Day 2018, Apple made a donation to Conservation International. We then partnered with the nonprofit to use the funds to protect and restore a 27,000-acre mangrove forest in Colombia, which is expected to sequester 1 million metric tons of CO2 over the project\\'s lifetime. These mangroves not only protect the coasts and help support the livelihood of those communities where they grow, they can also store up to 10 times more carbon than forests on land. This is because mangroves store significant amounts of \"blue\" carbon in the soil below the water line, in addition to storing carbon in their roots, leaves, and branches like other trees. Our project with Conservation International was the first to fully value the entire ecosystem-- trees and soil--for its climate mitigation value. We hope this effort will encourage the protection of threatened mangrove ecosystems globally as important resources in the fight against climate change.\\nWe also donated to the SEE Foundation in China with funds raised from the Earth Day campaign. With this contribution, SEE Foundation supported 20 grassroots NGOs in China focused on enhancing waste management and pollution control. SEE also facilitated crossindustry collaboration such as introducing Zero Waste concepts to the outdoor sports industry.\\nStakeholder roundtables.\\nOver the past several years, we have invited key stakeholders to participate in roundtables in Europe, the United States, and China to obtain feedback on Apple\\'s key environmental programs, like our work on Smarter Chemistry and our ambition to create a circular supply chain for the materials in our products. Attendees at these roundtables have included a range of academics, NGOs, industry leaders, and other companies. Since these meetings, we have collaborated with subject-matter experts, think tanks, NGOs, and consulting firms to support our work.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 53\\n\\x0cSpeaking up for stronger climate policies.\\nClimate change is one of the greatest threats facing our planet. Clean energy technology offers tremendous benefits to our suppliers, electricity grids, and communities around the world. We believe that if policymakers fully and properly value these benefits, clean energy becomes more cost-competitive than fossil fuel energy. Market and policy design is not one-size-fits-all, so we work closely with our suppliers and local experts to find the best solution for each country. For the past four years, we have been advocating for strong climate policies that promote decarbonizing our economy and support procurement of renewable energy.\\n\\nJuly 2015 (U.S.): Apple joined the White House\\'s American Business Act on Climate Pledge, in which participating companies voiced support for a strong outcome at the COP21 in Paris and demonstrated an ongoing commitment to climate action.\\nApril 2016 (U.S.): Apple joined Google, Microsoft, and Amazon to sign an amicus brief in support of the U.S. EPA\\'s Clean Power Plan\\nJune 2016 (World): Lisa Jackson addressed 700 senior government, business, and community leaders at the seventh Clean Energy Ministerial, where she called for governments across the world to put a price on carbon to address climate change.\\nApril 2017 (Japan): Apple joined nine other companies, including Fujitsu, Ikea, Microsoft, Patagonia, and Sony to formally encourage the Japanese government to promote corporate renewable energy use.\\nJune 2017 (China): Apple spoke at the eighth Clean Energy Ministerial in China to highlight our commitment to climate change, particularly our partnership with suppliers to reduce carbon emissions from manufacturing.\\nJune 2017 (U.S.): Apple urged the White House to remain in the Paris climate agreement and take meaningful action on climate change\\nAugust 2017 (China): Apple met with central and provincial-level policymakers across China to advocate for corporations to be able to purchase directly from renewable energy power plants.\\nNovember 2017 (China): Apple hosted a roundtable with the Green Electricity Consumption Cooperative Organization (GECCO) to create a platform for buyers in China to discuss renewable energy procurement challenges and opportunities, and inform future policy.\\nNovember 2017 (Vietnam): Apple joined a number of other companies urging the government of Vietnam to make regulatory changes allowing companies to procure renewable energy through direct power purchase agreements.\\n\\nMarch 2019 (Kenya): Apple participated in the UN Environmental Assembly and conducted bilateral discussions with a number of countries to advocate for policies that enable a circular economy and bold action on climate.\\nJanuary 2019 (Vietnam): Apple met with government officials to discuss benefits of electricity market reform, including allowing businesses to purchase power directly from renewable power plants.\\nDecember 2018 (China): Apple provided feedback and insights on its approach to renewables procurement in China in support of a publication developed to help the broader corporate community identify renewable energy solutions.\\nOctober 2018 (Japan): Apple spoke about clean energy and closed loop innovation at Japan\\'s Innovation for Cool Earth Forum (ICEF), an international gathering to tackle climate change through technical innovation.\\nOctober 2018 (South Korea): Apple met with government officials in Korea to advocate for increased renewable generation and for retail choice, whereby consumers can select their power source.\\nApril 2018 (U.S.): Apple filed individual comments to the U.S. EPA, urging it not to repeal the Clean Power Plan because of its importance in reducing emissions.\\nApril 2018 (China): Apple submitted formal comments to China\\'s National Development and Reform Commission about the implications of draft policy on corporate clean energy procurement.\\nFebruary 2018 (Japan): Apple filed comments with the Japanese government, calling for the development of a robust and verifiable renewable energy trading system.\\nJanuary 2018 (U.S.): Apple filed comments to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, urging it not to finalize a rule that would subsidize fossil fuels, which would limit the ability of renewables to compete in the electricity market.

Over time, we have greatly refined our model to include more Apple-specific data instead of industry averages. The decrease in Scope 3 emissions in fiscal year 2016 is partly due to these modeling changes, including improved modeling of the integrated circuits in Apple products. Further, there are systematic changes made in some emissions factors to reflect changes in global electricity grids.\\n Scope 3 emissions associated with employee commute and business travel are included in the table \"Facilities Environmental Performance Indicators.\"\\n Carbon emissions associated with our products\\' end of life decreased in fiscal year 2017, because of changes in methodology to more accurately reflect disposal and recycling practices.\\n Arsenic is present in minute quantities in some semiconductor devices.\\nEvery Apple product is free of PVC and phthalates with the exception of power cords in India, Thailand, and South Korea, where we continue to seek government approval for our PVC and phthalates replacement. 7Apple products comply with the European Union Directive 2011/65/EU and its amendments, including exemptions for the use of lead such as high-temperature solder. Apple is working to phase out the use of these exempted\\nsubstances where technically possible. 8 While Apple\\'s phaseout covers the vast majority of products and components, products by Beddit, which Apple recently acquired, and some older Apple product designs may not be fully BFRfree and PVCfree. However, these\\nproducts, including their replacement parts and accessories, were still designed to meet regulatory requirements.\\nOverview of Apple\\'s product life cycle carbon assessment (LCA) methodology\\nApple uses five steps when conducting a product LCA.\\n1. To model the manufacturing phase, we use part-by-part measurements of the entire product along with data on part production. The measurements help us accurately determine the size and weight of the components and materials in the product, while data on manufacturing processes and yield loss during production allows us to account for the impact of manufacturing. The LCA includes accessories, packaging, and units that are repaired and replaced through AppleCare.\\n2. To model customer use, we measure the power consumed by a product while it is running in a simulated scenario. Daily usage patterns are specific to each product and are a mixture of actual and modeled customer use data. For the purposes of our assessment, years of use, which are based on first owners, are modeled to be four years for macOS and tvOS devices and three years for iOS and watchOS devices. Most Apple products last longer and are passed along, resold, or returned to Apple by the first owner for others to use. More information on our product energy use is provided in our Product Environmental Reports.\\n3. To model transportation, we use data collected on shipments of single products and multipack units by land, sea, and air. We account for transporting materials between manufacturing sites; transporting products from manufacturing sites to regional distribution hubs; transporting products from regional distribution hubs to individual customers; and transporting products from final customers to recycling facilities.\\n4. To model recycling, we use material composition data on our products and cover the treatment steps carried out by the recycler to obtain metal, plastic, and glass material streams. Subsequent processing and remelting steps are not included, as these are considered stages of production and not endoflife processing.\\n5. After we collect data about production, use, transport, and recycling, we combine it with detailed greenhouse gas emission data. This emission data is based on a combination of Apple-specific and industry-average datasets for material production, manufacturing processes, electricity generation, and transportation. Renewable energy used in the supply chain, initiated by suppliers independently or through the Apple Supplier Clean Energy Program, are also accounted for. Combining product-specific data with emission data in our LCA tool allows us to compile detailed results for greenhouse gas emissions as they relate to the product. The data and modeling approaches are checked for quality and accuracy by the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany.\\nThere is inherent uncertainty in modeling carbon emissions due primarily to data limitations. For the top component contributors to Apple\\'s carbon emissions, Apple addresses this uncertainty by developing detailed process-based environmental models with Apple-specific parameters. For the remaining elements of Apple\\'s carbon footprint, we rely on industry average data and assumptions.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 57\\n\\x0cScopes 1 and 2 Carbon Emissions Breakdown (metric tons COe)\\n\\nFiscal Year\\nLocation\\nCorporate Cupertino, CA Elk Grove, CA Austin, TX Other U.S. Cork, Ireland Singapore China Other International\\nData centers Maiden, NC Newark, CA Prineville, OR Reno, NV Mesa, AZ Viborg, Denmark Colocation facilities (U.S.)** Colocation facilities (International)**\\nRetail stores U.S. International\\nBusiness fleet\\nProcess emissions***\\nOther Scope 1 (Diesel, Propane, fugitive emissions)\\nTotals\\n\\nScope 1\\n29,980 24,720 630 320 1,350 890 30 200 1,840\\n60 30 0 20 0 10 -- N/A N/A\\n4,300 2,720 1,580\\n11,110\\n3,490\\n5,640\\n54,600\\n\\n2018\\nScope 2\\n7,980 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7,980\\n410 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 410\\n350 0 350\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n8,730\\n\\nScope 1\\n25,430 20,580 530 330 1,160 710 90 220 1,810\\n4,210 150 70 950 1,530 1,510 -- N/A N/A\\n4,920 2,490 2,430\\n8,300\\n2,540\\n--\\n45,400\\n\\n2017*\\nScope 2\\n33,290 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 33,290\\n1,520 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1,520\\n1,440 0 1,440\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n36,250\\n\\nScope 1\\n20,537 17,121 397 248 883 780 65 38 1,005\\n2,738 126 139 1,077 713 683 -- N/A N/A\\n3,679 1,597 2,082\\n7,370\\n--\\n--\\n34,324\\n\\n2016\\nScope 2\\n30,408 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 30,408\\n1,621 0 0 0 0 0 -- 0 1,621\\n8,920 0 8,920\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n40,953\\n\\nScope 1\\n15,415 13,248 369 233 121 892 0 117 435\\n13 0 0 13 0 -- -- N/A N/A\\n3,800 2,269 1,531\\n8,744\\n--\\n--\\n27,972\\n\\n2015\\nScope 2\\n19,564 0 0 0 0 0 3,767 2,201 13,596\\n0 0 0 0 0 -- -- -- --\\n22,893 0 22,893\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n42,457\\n\\nFiscal Year\\nLocation\\nCorporate Cupertino, CA Elk Grove, CA Austin, TX Other U.S. Cork, Ireland Singapore China Other International\\nData centers Maiden, NC Newark, CA Prineville, OR Reno, NV\\nRetail stores Domestic (U.S.) International\\nBusiness fleet\\nTotals\\n\\nScope 1\\n15,335 12,929 411 148 115 1,000 51 385 296\\n18 0 0 18 0\\n5,355 2,812 2,543\\n7,778\\n28,486\\n\\n2014\\nScope 2\\n21,555 0 0 0 0 0 6,852 8,577 6,126\\n0 0 0 0 0\\n41,658 11,036 30,662\\nN/A\\n63,213\\n\\nScope 1\\n13,727 10,747 509 83 337 743 50 390 868\\n2,201 2,201 0 0 0\\n6,158 3,548 2,610\\n7,214\\n29,300\\n\\n2013\\nScope 2\\n17,503 0 0 0 0 0 5,826 7,490 4,187\\n0 0 0 0 0\\n74,002 44,606 29,397\\nN/A\\n91,505\\n\\nScope 1\\n11,343 9,132 560 59 237 715 32 -- 609\\n146 146 0 0 0\\n2,812 787 2,025\\n6,923\\n21,224\\n\\n2012\\nScope 2\\n48,215 25,450 0 0 4,265 0 4,946 1,049 12,505\\n7,664 0 7,664 0 0\\n83,285 -- --\\nN/A\\n139,164\\n\\nScope 1\\n12,656 9,238 556 45 564 804 -- -- 1,449\\n0 0 0 -- --\\n2,600 746 1,854\\n6,400\\n21,656\\n\\n2011\\nScope 2\\n59,516 39,428 0 0 2,141 0 3,243 280 14,424\\n28,988 0 28,988 -- --\\n65,769 -- --\\nN/A\\n154,273\\n\\n-- Indicates that the energy source is not yet online.\\nScope 1 emissions result from natural gas use in buildings, and fuel use for fleet vehicles.

In fiscal year 2018, combustion of biogas for our fuel cells resulted in 41,040 metric tons of direct COe emissions. The biogas fuel cells are included in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions since they are within our operational control and their renewable certificates are matched with our data center load. These emissions are not counted in Apple\\'s footprint because they would have occurred naturally even if we had not combusted the biogas.\\n**The building operations and cooling emissions (PUE) associated with our colocated data facilities are beyond our operational control and therefore these emissions are not included in our report.\\n*** Emissions from R&D processes.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 58\\n\\x0cNatural Gas and Electricity Use (fiscal year 2018)\\nThe chart below provides a detailed breakdown of fiscal year 2018 energy use, which we used to calculate our greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\nFiscal Year 2018\\n\\nLocation\\nCorporate Cupertino, CA Elk Grove, CA Austin, TX Other U.S. Cork, Ireland Singapore China Other International\\nData centers Maiden, NC Newark, CA Prineville, OR Reno, NV Mesa, AZ Viborg, Denmark Colocation Facilities (USA)** Colocation Facilities (International)**\\nRetail stores Domestic (U.S.) International\\nTotals\\nPercent renewable*\\n\\nTotal Gas (mmBTU)\\n796,730 697,670 11,840 6,090 25,410 16,730 630 3,830 34,530\\n541,690 540,970 -- 460 -- 260 -- N/A N/A\\n80,820 51,160 29,660\\n1,419,240\\n\\nNatural Gas\\nRenewable Biogas (mmBTU)\\n232,430 232,430 -- -- -- -- -- -- --\\n540,970 540,970 -- -- -- -- -- N/A N/A\\n-- -- --\\n773,400\\n54%\\n\\nTotal Electricity (million kWh)\\n638 381 15 54 22 16 16 29 105\\n1,349 295 114 252 253 104 4 244 83\\n195 96 99\\n2,182\\n\\nElectricity\\nRenewable Electricity (million kWh)\\n625 381 15 54 22 16 16 29 92\\n1,348 295 114 252 253 104 4 244 82\\n194 96 98\\n2,167\\n99%\\n\\n-- Data not tracked N/A = Gas use at colocation facilities is considered outside of Apple\\'s operational control. * Beginning January 1, 2018, we reached 100 percent renewable energy. ** W e\\'ve updated our fiscal year 2016 colocation facilities footprint to reflect more accurately Apple\\'s operational boundaries.

We\\'ve learned a lot about how best to secure renewable energy, which has helped us educate suppliers and expand our renewable energy efforts into our supply chain. This Facilities Renewable Energy Supplement summarizes the types of renewable energy solutions we\\'ve deployed, and details how we implement renewable energy at our data centers--our largest energy loads.\\nHow we secure renewable energy\\nSince launching our renewable energy program in 2011, we have implemented a number of solutions to procure renewable energy. Our strategy has evolved over time to create the most positive impact.\\nOwnership and PURPA. In 2011, Apple\\'s 100 percent equity ownership of our Maiden solar arrays was the first time a non-energy commercial company built its own utility-scale solar PV project. We used a 1978 federal law called the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) to structure the project. We then applied this same structure to two more large solar PV and biogas fuel cell projects in North Carolina and two micro-hydro projects in Oregon. This was a landmark moment in corporate renewable energy development and led to an increased use of PURPA in these states.\\nDirect Access. Since 2012, in California and Oregon, we\\'ve used a program called Direct Access to bypass the default electricity generation offered by the utilities servicing our data centers in those states. Instead, we contracted directly with independent power producers who could supply 100 percent renewable electricity. After initially buying from existing, third-party owned projects, we\\'re now procuring renewable energy from projects we created: The Solar Star II project delivers renewables to our Oregon data center, and the California Flats solar project to our data center in California.\\nGreen rider. In 2013, we opened a new data center in Reno, Nevada. With no PURPA or Direct Access options in Nevada, we worked directly with the local utility, NV Energy, to create a whole new regulatory structure. The \"Nevada Green Rider\" enables us to secure a long-term, fixedprice contract for renewable electricity from a new solar PV project built for us, but managed by the utility. We\\'ve used this partnership to create four solar projects totaling 320 megawatts.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 60\\n\\x0cEquity investment. In 2014, we invested in two 20-megawatt solar PV projects in Sichuan, China to support all our in-country retail stores, corporate offices, and data storage facilities. This project represented the first time a commercial company created a new large-scale project in China for its own use. We\\'ve since replicated this model many times for Apple\\'s supply chain.\\nPortfolio solutions. In 2015 and 2016, we adapted to land scarcity constraints in Singapore and Japan by contracting for solar PV on 800 rooftops in Singapore and 300 in Japan. We adapted our approach in each country to fit local partnerships and regulatory structures: We signed a long-term agreement similar to a power purchase agreement in Singapore and made an equity investment in Japan. These projects offer us long-term flexibility as our load grows.\\nRenewable microgrid. Since 2017, we\\'ve been powering Apple Park with 100 percent renewable energy--about 75 percent of which is generated onsite and managed by a microgrid. The onsite generation comes from 14 megawatts of rooftop solar PV and 4 megawatts of baseload biogas fuel cells. Any additional energy required is drawn by Direct Access from the California Flats solar project in nearby Monterey County. The microgrid system with battery storage manages the renewable energy generation and the building\\'s energy use; optimizes demand management, load shifting, and frequency regulation services; and ensures uninterrupted energy reliability against local grid outages.\\nA focus on data centers\\nWe used over 1.3 billion kWh of electricity in fiscal year 2018 to power our data centers and colocation facilities around the world, representing over 60 percent of Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We\\'re proud that 100 percent of that electricity came from clean, renewable sources including solar, wind, biogas fuel cells, and low-impact hydro power. To cover our needs, we build our own renewable power projects and work with utilities to purchase clean energy from locally obtained resources. In fiscal year 2018, we avoided the equivalent of more than 466,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions by using 100 percent renewable energy for our data centers--that\\'s equivalent to taking almost 100,000 cars off the road for a year.1\\nWe\\'re staying at 100 percent even as Apple\\'s data center presence continues to grow. We now operate five data centers, and several more are being developed. These data centers are spread across North America, Europe, and Asia. Each has unique design features that conserve energy and reflect the climate, as well as other aspects, of its location.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\n1 G reenhouse gas equivalencies calculated using the U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator: http://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 61\\n\\x0cSolar + Biogas Fuel Cells\\nMaiden, North Carolina\\nBetween 2011 and 2015, we installed 68 megawatts of Apple-created projects: two 20-megawatt solar projects, an 18-megawatt solar project, and 10 megawatts of biogas fuel cells. We then partnered with the local utility, Duke Energy, to help build five solar projects through its Green Source Rider program. These solar projects came online beginning in 2015 and were Duke Energy\\'s first Green Source Rider projects to become operational. We worked with Duke Energy for several years to develop this green energy tariff option, which allowed Apple and Duke Energy to work together to develop new renewable energy projects. The five projects have a combined capacity of 20 megawatts. In 2017, we made long-term commitments to five more solar projects in North Carolina, for an additional 86 megawatts of clean energy. In fiscal year 2018, the Maiden data center was supported by projects that generated 303 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the energy used by almost 24,000 North Carolina homes.2\\nEnergy efficiency measures we\\'ve implemented at our Maiden data centers include use of outside air cooling through a waterside economizer during night and cool-weather hours, which, along with water storage, allows the chillers to be idle 75 percent of the time.\\n\\nMaiden, North Carolina--100% renewable since opening June 2010\\n\\n303 million kWh energy use in fiscal year 2018\\n\\nDuke Energy Default Grid Mix\\n\\nApple Actual Renewable Energy Use\\n\\nNuclear\\n\\n51% Apple\\'s Solar Projects\\n\\n38%\\n\\nCoal\\n\\n33% Apple\\'s Biogas Fuel Cells\\n\\n24%\\n\\nOther\\n\\n16% Duke Green Source Rider\\n\\n12%\\n\\n(100% solar)\\n\\nRenewable\\n\\n<1% NC GreenPower (100% solar)\\n\\n14%\\n\\nOther Solar Contracts\\n\\n12%\\n\\n2018 Default Emissions\\n\\n110,910 2018 Effective Emissions\\n\\n0\\n\\n(mtons COe/year)\\n\\n(mtons COe/year)\\n\\nFrom Duke Energy Carolinas 2015 Statistical Supplement generation data\\n\\nActual fiscal year 2018 energy data\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\n2 C arbon emissions equivalences calculated using U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2017 data: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf.\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 62\\n\\x0cWind + Solar + Low-Impact Hydro\\nPrineville, Oregon\\nTo support our Prineville data center, we recently signed a 200-megawatt power purchase agreement for a new Oregon wind farm, the Montague Wind Power Facility, set to come online later in 2019. It\\'s our largest project to date, producing over 560 million kWh of clean, renewable energy a year.\\nAdditionally, we executed a power purchase agreement for the 56-megawatt Solar Star Oregon II project located just a few miles from our data center. This solar PV project, which came online and began supporting the data center in 2017, produces 140 million kWh of renewable energy a year. To strengthen the connection between Apple and these projects, we use Oregon\\'s Direct Access program to supply the renewable energy from these projects directly to our data center.\\nAlso supporting the data center are two micro-hydro projects that harness the power of water flowing through local irrigation canals that have been operating for over 60 years. These microhydro projects generate about 7 to 10 million kWh of renewable energy a year.\\nTo supplement these projects, we executed a long-term purchase agreement for all environmental attributes from a 50-megawatt portfolio of six solar projects in Oregon.\\nIn fiscal year 2018, the Prineville data center was supported by projects that generated 252 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the energy used by 21,670 Oregon homes.2\\nOur Prineville data center takes advantage of the cool and dry climate by cooling the servers with outside air whenever possible.

So, in 2013, we created a partnership with the local utility, NV Energy, to develop the Fort Churchill Solar project. Apple designed, financed, and constructed the project, and NV Energy operates it and directs all the renewable energy it produces to our data center. The Fort Churchill Solar project uses a photovoltaic panel with curved mirrors that concentrate sunlight. The 20-megawatt array has an annual production capacity of over 43 million kWh.\\nTo facilitate further renewable development in Nevada, Apple worked with NV Energy and the Nevada utility commission to create a green energy option open to all commercial customers, called the Nevada Green Rider, that does not require the customer to fund project development up-front. Thanks to this new option, in 2015 we announced our second Nevada solar project, the 50-megawatt Boulder Solar II project. This project came online in 2017, producing 137 million kWh of renewable energy a year.\\nWe have used the Nevada Green Rider two more times, first for the 200-megawatt Techren Solar II project. Apple\\'s largest solar project to date, it is estimated to produce over 540 million kWh when it comes online later this year. Next was the 50-megawatt Turquoise Nevada project, estimated to produce 110 million kWh a year and come online in 2020.\\nIn fiscal year 2018, the Reno data center was supported by projects that generated 253 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the energy used by 24,690 Nevada homes.2\\nLike in Prineville, our Reno data center takes advantage of the mild climate by cooling the servers with outside air whenever possible.

As our loads grow over time, we\\'ll continue working with our colocation suppliers to match 100 percent of our energy use with renewables.\\nFurthermore, we worked with one of our main suppliers of colocation services to help it develop the capability to provide renewable energy solutions to its customers. This partnership advances Apple\\'s renewable energy program and those of other companies that use this colocation provider.\\n\\nEnergy Use and Emissions at Apple\\'s Colocation Facilities\\n\\nFY2011 FY2012 FY2013 FY2014 FY2015 FY20164 FY2017 FY2018\\n\\nTotal Energy Use (kWh) 42,500\\n38,552,300 79,462,900 108,659,700 142,615,000 145,520,900 289,195,800 327,663,800\\n\\nRenewable Energy (kWh) 0\\n1,471,680 46,966,900 88,553,400 121,086,100 143,083,200 286,378,100 326,959,700\\n\\nDefault Utility Emissions1\\n(metric tons CO2e) 10\\n17,200 31,800 44,300 60,500 66,300 125,600 146,600\\n\\nApple\\'s Emissions-- Including Renewable\\nEnergy2 (metric tons CO2e)\\n10\\n16,500\\n14,500\\n11,000\\n12,700\\n1,600\\n1,500\\n400\\n\\nPercent Renewable Energy3 0% 4% 59% 81% 85% 98% 99% 99.8%\\n\\n1 We calculate \"default utility emissions\" to provide baseline emissions of what our carbon footprint would have been without the use of renewable energy.

Beginning January 1, 2018, all of the electricity use at our colocation facilities is from 100 percent renewable energy.\\n4 Over the past two years, we have been installing submeters in colocation facilities to better track electricity usage. Beginning in FY2016, we started reporting this submetered electricity usage. Prior to fiscal year 2016, reported electricity usage was conservatively estimated based on maximum contract capacity quantities. We\\'ve updated our fiscal year 2016 colocation facilities footprint to reflect more accurately Apple\\'s operational boundaries. Per the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol, we\\'ve removed from our electricity usage and Scope 2 calculations those emissions associated with colocation facility cooling and building operations.\\n\\nRegional Energy Use at Apple\\'s Colocation Facilities\\n\\nU.S. Europe APAC FY2018 Total\\n\\nTotal Energy Use (kWh)\\n244,376,400 30,831,400 52,456,000\\n327,663,800\\n\\nRenewable Energy (kWh)\\n244,376,400 30,114,500 52,368,800\\n326,859,700\\n\\nPercent Renewable Energy 100% 98% 100% 99.8%\\n\\nBeyond the use of our own data centers and colocation facilities, we also use third-party computing services to support some of our on-demand cloud storage-based services.

This review and verification focuses on Scope 3 emissions for products sold by Apple Inc. (as defined by WRI/WBCSD/Greenhouse Gas Protocol  Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard). It is noted that emissions relating to the facilities that are owned or leased by Apple (scope 1 and 2 emissions) as well as business travel and employee commute were subject to a separate third party verification and are therefore excluded from the scope of this statement. Confidential data relating to product sales and shipments were also excluded from the scope of this verification.\\nThis review and verification covers Apple\\'s annual greenhouse gas emissions and does not replace reviews conducted for individual product LCAs for greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). The life cycle emissions data produced by Apple for individual products has been calculated in accordance to the standard ISO 14040/14044: Environmental management  Life cycle assessment  Principles and framework / Requirements and guidelines. This review and verification furthermore complies with ISO 14064-3: Greenhouse gases -- Part 3: Specification with guidance for the validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions.\\nThe review of the annual carbon footprint has considered the following criteria:\\n The system, boundaries and functional unit are clearly defined\\n Assumptions and estimations made are appropriate\\n Selection of primary and secondary data is appropriate and methodologies used\\nare adequately disclosed\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\nComprehensive Carbon Footprint Letter of Assurance Client: Apple Inc.\\n\\n1\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 72\\n\\x0cThese criteria are also fundamental to the review of LCAs conducted for individual product emissions. The reviewers note that the largest share (98%) of Apple Inc. annual carbon footprint is comprised of scope 3 emissions from individual products. The aforementioned criteria have been regularly reviewed by Fraunhofer IZM since 2007 with a view to providing independent feedback that can facilitate continuous improvement and refinement in the LCA methodology applied by Apple Inc.\\n\\nData reported by Apple is as follows:\\n\\nManufacturing Transportation Product Use\\n\\n2018\\n\\n18.49\\n\\n1.33\\n\\n4.65\\n\\n[MMT CO2e]\\n\\n[MMT CO2e]\\n\\n[MMT CO2e]\\n\\nMMT CO2e: million metric tons carbon dioxide equivalents\\n\\nRecycling\\n0.05\\n[MMT CO2e]\\n\\nIncluding a reported value of 0.58 million metric tons CO2e for facilities (out of scope of this verification), total comprehensive carbon footprint is reported to be 25.2 million metric tons CO2e.\\n\\nApple\\'s comprehensive carbon footprint includes an increasing amount of greenhouse gas emissions reductions for manufacturing resulting from Apple renewable energy projects, supplier renewable electricity purchases, and supplier renewable electricity installations. These reductions are part of Apple\\'s Clean Energy Program. Fraunhofer IZM has not verified these emissions reductions.\\n\\nBased on the process and procedures conducted, there is no evidence that the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) assertion with regards to scope 3 carbon footprint\\n\\n is not materially correct and is not a fair representation of GHG data and\\ninformation, and\\n\\n has not been prepared in accordance with the related International Standard on\\nGHG quantification, monitoring and reporting.\\n\\n2 Reviewed Data and Plausibility Check\\n\\nA verification and sampling plan as required by ISO 14046-3 has been established for the comprehensive carbon footprint review and verification, defining the level of assurance, objectives, criteria, scope and materiality of the verification.\\nAs part of this review and verification Apple disclosed following data to Fraunhofer IZM:\\n Sales data for FY2018, including accessories and including AppleCare, Apple\\'s\\nextended warranty and technical support plans for their devices.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\nComprehensive Carbon Footprint Letter of Assurance Client: Apple Inc.\\n\\n2\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 73\\n\\x0c Product specific data on transportation including breakdown of air and sea\\nshipment\\n Life cycle GHG emissions for all products, differentiating the actual product\\nconfigurations (e.g. memory capacity)\\n Calculation methodology for the comprehensive carbon footprint and\\nmethodological changes implemented in 2018\\n The total carbon footprint  scope 3 for the fiscal year 2018\\n Detailed analysis of the comprehensive carbon footprint including:\\no The breakdown of the carbon footprint into life cycle phases manufacturing, transportation, product use and recycling\\no Detailed product specific split into life cycle phases o The contribution of individual products and product families to the overall\\ncarbon footprint\\nThe data and information supporting the GHG assertion were projected (use phase and recycling) and historical (i.e. fiscal year 2018 data regarding sales figures, manufacturing, transportation).\\nThis review comprises a check of selected data, which are most influential to the overall carbon footprint. The overall plausibility check addressed the following questions:\\n Are product LCAs referenced correctly?\\n Are results for products, for which no full LCA review was undertaken, plausible?\\n Are carbon emission data for individual products plausible in the light of\\nmethodological changes as indicated by Apple?\\nThis review was done remotely.\\n3 Findings\\nIn FY2018 and beginning of FY2019 10 recent product LCA studies have been reviewed successfully against ISO 14040/44. These LCAs cover product segments MacBook Pro, iMac, Apple Watch, Homepod and iPhone. These recently reviewed LCA studies cover products which represent in total 44,9% of the total scope 3 carbon footprint. Representatives of other product segments (iPod, iPad, Mac Pro, Mac Mini, Airport Express\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\nComprehensive Carbon Footprint Letter of Assurance Client: Apple Inc.\\n\\n3\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 74\\n\\x0c/ Airport Extreme, Apple TV, and Beats products) underwent no or only minor design changes compared to those which went through a full LCA review in former years. All reviewed LCA studies up to now cover in total 67,9% of the total scope 3 carbon footprint.\\nAll questions raised in the course of the review were answered by Apple and related evidence was provided where needed.\\n\\n4 Conclusions\\nApple\\' assessment approach is excellent in terms of granularity of the used calculation data. A significant share of components is modelled with accurate primary data from Apple\\'s suppliers.\\nFor all product LCA calculations, where exact data was missing, the principle of a worstcase approach has been followed and results have been calculated with rather conservative estimates.\\nThe review has not found assumptions or calculation errors on the carbon footprint data level that indicate the scope 3 carbon footprint has been materially misstated. The excellent analysis meets the principles of good scientific practice.\\nBerlin, April 3, 2019\\n\\n- Karsten Schischke Fraunhofer IZM Dept.

We consider wood fibers to include bamboo.\\n3 A pple defines its restrictions on harmful substances, including definitions for what Apple considers to be \"free of,\" in the Apple Regulated Substances Specification. Every Apple product is free of PVC and phthalates with the exception of AC power cords in India, Thailand, and South Korea, where we continue to seek government approval for our PVC and phthalates replacements. While Apple\\'s phaseout covers the vast majority of products and components, products by Beddit, which Apple recently acquired, and some older Apple product designs may not be fully BFRfree and PVCfree. Apple products comply with the European Union Directive 2011/65/EU and its amendments, including exemptions for the use of lead such as high-temperature solder. Apple is working to phase out the use of these exempted substances where technically possible.\\n4 Based on sales-weighted averages.\\n5 E missions from corporate facilities increased by one percentage point in 2018, due to a reduced overall carbon footprint and to changes to how we calculate air travel, which significantly increased Scope 3 business travel emissions.\\n6 T he CPU, SoC, DRAM, and memory (NAND) make up the bulk of the integrated circuit emissions.\\n7 \" Boards and flexes\" refers to bare printed circuit boards and flexible printed circuits.\\n8 Integrated circuits, aluminum, bare boards and flexes, display, onboard electronics, steel, and final assembly facilities make up 93 percent of manufacturing emissions. The remaining 7 percent (\"other manufacturing\") includes battery cells, other materials (such as copper), plastic, packaging, glass, and miscellaneous upstream transportation. These are listed in order of their contribution.\\n9 \" Electronics\" includes capacitors, resistors, transistors, diodes, and other electronic components soldered to bare board and flexes, other than the integrated circuits.\\n10 iOS active charge: active charging of the battery for iOS devices.\\n11 m acOS active: active use of macOS devices.\\n12 m acOS idle: macOS devices that are awake, but non-active.\\n13 o ther: all other modes and devices.\\n14 G reenhouse gas equivalencies calculated using the U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator: www.epa.gov/energy/ greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator.\\n15 Compared to a conventional, single-converter power supply design. iMac Pro incorporates a high-efficiency, dual-converter power supply design.\\n16 Recycling enables use of recovered materials instead of mined materials, thus conserving finite resources. Recycled content claims for materials in our products have been verified by an independent third party to a recycled content standard that conforms to ISO 14021.\\n17 Apple is committed to the responsible sourcing of materials for our products. In 2018, our efforts to responsibly source cobalt continued, and 100 percent of identified refiners participated in third-party audits, for the third year in a row.

To determine the output of Apple\\'s projects, we work with our partners to understand the productive potential of these working forests. The forest management plans required to achieve or maintain certification limit harvest volumes to sustainable levels. We use these potential harvest volumes to estimate the sustainable productive capacity of these forests.\\n24 Our target is for waste reduction by weight, from a baseline of fiscal year 2018. We consider ongoing operations and renovations within this boundary but not new construction.\\n25 Final assembly supplier sites are third-party certified as Zero Waste by UL LLC (UL 2799 Standard). For all platinum certified final assembly sites, this means that they do not generate any waste sent to landfill. In two cases, assembly facilities were certified Gold with a maximum of 5 percent waste to landfill because the carbon impact of shipping materials for recycling outweighed the environmental benefit of diversion.\\n26 Our early efforts to footprint our water use show that vast majority of non-electricity related water withdrawals are related to our supply chain. We are working to expand our understanding of our non-electricity water use so that we can build a more comprehensive water footprint. Our best estimates to isolate process water withdrawals helps us prioritize our work in the supply chain to sub-assembly and commodity suppliers like those that build our semiconductors, displays, and enclosures.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 86\\n\\x0c27 Apple products are free of PVC and phthalates with the exception of power cords in India, Thailand, and South Korea, where we continue to seek government approval for our PVC and phthalates replacement.

We strive to use our economic, environmental, social and governance resources thoughtfully and responsibly. We\\'re a global company, and this report reflects our impact around the world as we work together for the benefit of people and our planet.\\nPatients come first at McKesson. Our vision is to improve care in every setting -- one product, one partner, one patient at a time. In this report, we share how we ensure that the products we handle and distribute, as well as those we manufacture in our private-label line of business, follow applicable regulations. We also describe how we create a better experience for patients, customers and manufacturers through Six Sigma, with more than 400 projects in Fiscal 2019 alone.\\nA Culture of Integrity and Operational Excellence McKesson plays a key role in helping deliver effective and efficient healthcare. But way we do business is as important as what we do. Compliance and ethics, and strong corporate governance, provide the cornerstones of our approach to corporate responsibility.\\nWe are deeply concerned by the impact the opioid epidemic is having on families and communities across the U.S. We are making progress on the corporate initiatives we announced in March 2018 to help address the opioid epidemic. We have worked with outside experts to help educate customers about compliance with regulations and how to identify warning signs of prescription abuse and potential diversion. We\\'ve offered thoughtful public policy recommendations, including the Prescription Safety Alert System (RxSAS) technology proposal,\\n\\nand supported innovative programs and partnerships that we believe can have a meaningful impact on this challenging issue. We also contributed $100 million to the Foundation for Opioid Response Efforts (FORE), an independently governed foundation focused on combating the crisis.\\nCommitted to Environmental Stewardship Using resources wisely is good for business, and it\\'s good for the environment. We continue to focus on reducing energy use and finding alternative sources of energy. In the U.S., we signed a long-term agreement to purchase power from solar arrays, and our warehouses in Belgium have used renewable energy since our Fiscal 2017. Besides recycling and reusing resources, we also support donation programs in Canada, Europe and the U.S., so unused products and supplies reach nonprofit organizations that can benefit from them. Spending wisely has also helped to lighten our environmental impact. This past year, we saw a substantial reduction in employee air travel, which led to an 11% reduction in Scope 3 CO2 emissions from the previous year.\\nSupporting Healthy Employees & Healthy Communities We\\'re committed to healthy employees and communities. That\\'s why we invest in programs to advance employee wellbeing and career growth. We have a culture of empowerment, recognition and belonging, and were recognized as one of the best employers for diversity.\\nOur employees have a passion for creating stronger communities. In the past year, McKesson employees supported 1,183 organizations, volunteering at the workplace and in their free time. We continue to grow the bone marrow registry through our multi-year drive, which has led to six transplants\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\n>Table of Contents|3\\n\\x0cLetter from Brian Tyler\\nto date. When emergencies strike, we stand by our customers, communities and our employees. In Fiscal 2019, we expanded our employee relief fund to Canada and introduced $1,000 grants to provide evacuation assistance to employees facing a natural disaster. During the past year alone, the Fund supported 393 employees with more than $842,000 in grants. Our work is grounded in our shared ICARE (integrity, customerfirst, accountability, respect and excellence) principles. I invite you to review this report and learn how those principles guide us in making a positive impact for patients, the environment and our society every day.\\nBrian Tyler Chief Executive Officer, McKesson Corporation\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\n>Table of Contents|4\\n\\x0cOur Approach to Corporate Responsibility\\n\\nMcKesson Corporation (McKesson) is a global leader in healthcare supply chain management solutions, retail pharmacy, community oncology and specialty care, and healthcare information technology. We partner with pharmaceutical manufacturers, providers, pharmacies, governments and other organizations in healthcare to help provide the right medicines, medical products and healthcare services to the right patients at the right time, safely and cost effectively.\\nIn FY19, we employed approximately 80,000 people, and our total revenues exceeded $214 billion. We operate primarily in the United States, Canada and Europe.\\nFor McKesson, corporate responsibility (CR) means better health for our planet and people everywhere. As a company, we\\'re working to use our economic, environmental, social and governance resources thoughtfully and responsibly. That way, we can make a positive impact on our company, our environment, and our society.\\nThe cornerstones of our approach to corporate responsibility are compliance and ethics and strong corporate governance.\\nCompliance and Ethics\\nAt McKesson, we believe that integrity is the foundation of our culture and is critical to our long-term success. We work to inspire and enable McKesson employees to act with integrity in all we do.\\nUnited by our ICARE shared principles Everything we do is driven by our shared principles, known as ICARE. These principles are a uniting force, connecting\\n\\nus across business units, geographies and functional areas. They shape our corporate culture. And they help us make a positive difference for patients, customers, partners, communities, shareholders and one another.\\nICARE is what we expect from each other, and what the people we touch expect from McKesson.\\nOur beacon: The McKesson Code of Conduct Our company operates in diverse business and regulatory environments. To ensure that all employees uphold the highest legal and ethical standards, we embed them in our Code of Conduct and require regular formal training on it.\\nA shared document across our company, our Code of Conduct is based on ICARE. It describes the fundamental principles, local policies and procedures that shape our work. It covers a wide range of topics that may occur when interacting with customers, industry partners and each other. It gives helpful guidance regarding where to turn in case of questions or concerns about the right thing to do. The Code of Conduct is available in 10 languages.\\nCompliance is integral to our culture Compliance is an integral part of our company and leadership culture. It refers to our obligation to laws, regulations and internal guidelines. For us, compliance is more than just following rules. It includes considering the actions we take, and adapting to new challenges and situations, always guided by our ICARE principles.\\nFor our culture to be sustainable, we need to involve everyone within the company. To meet the dynamic changes in this area, we continuously review our compliance management system and self-imposed standards.\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\n>Table of Contents|5\\n\\x0cOur Approach to Corporate Responsibility\\n\\nHow we\\'re organized Our Chief Compliance Officer is aided by a Compliance and Ethics Group as well as a designated compliance officer for each of our businesses. The Chief Compliance Officer oversees and monitors implementation of our programs, including the standards and guidelines set out by regulators. Our compliance program includes:\\n Written policies and procedures\\n Compliance communications and web resources\\n Regulatory and compliance training\\n Internal auditing and compliance monitoring\\n A toll-free whistleblower hotline\\n Investigations relating to compliance and ethics\\n Corrective and/or preventive action, where necessary\\nIn FY19, our Board of Directors formed a standing Compliance Committee, whose purpose is to assist the Board in overseeing McKesson\\'s compliance programs and management\\'s identification and evaluation of our principal legal and regulatory compliance risks.\\nRaising concerns and seeking guidance Every employee is responsible for ensuring we comply with the laws, regulations and ethical standards affecting our business.\\nOur employees raise concerns if they believe something inappropriate is happening at work. Managers have a duty to listen to employees\\' concerns and react to those concerns in an appropriate manner. By fostering an open environment, where all employees feel free to speak up without any fear of retaliation, we seek to advance our culture of compliance and integrity.\\n\\nThe McKesson whistleblower hotlines are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, in multiple languages. It allows employees to raise concerns (anonymously if they wish), including possible violations of McKesson policies or other illegal or unethical activity. We investigate all allegations, and we provide reports of allegations and investigations to senior management and the Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors.\\nThe hotlines are only one of the ways employees can raise concerns. We encourage employees to contact their supervisor, business unit compliance officer or the Human Resources or Legal departments with any concerns. We strictly prohibit retaliation against an employee who makes a good faith complaint through any channel. After investigating, we develop a corrective plan as needed. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors also receives reports on any allegations and investigations regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or audit matters.\\nPreventing corruption We do not tolerate corruption or bribery in our business practices by our employees or by third parties working on our behalf. We don\\'t promise, offer or give anything of value to a government official or an employee or representative of our business partners with the intent to improperly influence their conduct. Similarly, we don\\'t receive anything of value that could be interpreted to improperly influence our conduct. We expect our business partners and third parties working on our behalf to comply with all applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and standards.\\nPreventing slavery in our supply chain McKesson is committed to the highest ethical standards. To fulfill these standards, we take steps to ensure that slavery and related human trafficking do not form part of our supply chain, consistent with the UK Modern Slavery Act.\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nCompliance is an integral part of our company and leadership culture. More than simply following rules, it means considering our actions and adapting to new challenges and situations, always guided by our ICARE principles.\\n>Table of Contents|6\\n\\x0cOur Approach to Corporate Responsibility\\n\\nServing government customers As one of the largest government contractors in the U.S., McKesson is proud to partner with government customers to meet the healthcare needs of veterans, active military, children and disadvantaged groups. McKesson recognizes that our government customers face unique challenges and obligations, and we are dedicated to helping our customers suceed. Our Compliance and Ethics program is critical to the success of our government contracts.\\nOur Take on Good Governance\\nA balanced corporate governance approach aims to strengthen confidence in our company -- both in the capital markets and among the public -- and creates value over the long term. We know that good corporate governance advances trust among our shareholders, business partners and employees, promotes transparency in our company, and contributes to sustainable growth.\\nHere\\'s a look at our practices and processes for running our company responsibly.\\nWe have an Independent Board Chair Edward Mueller, previously Lead Independent Director, took over as Independent Chair of McKesson\\'s Board of Directors on April 1, 2019. He has been a member of the Board of Directors since April 2008 and the Lead Independent Director since July 2013.\\nOur Board champions diversity and inclusion Every company should bring together diversity of thought. At the time of publication, three of our ten directors are women and two of our directors are persons of color. Since 2002, women have held three seats on our Board.\\n\\nAnnual evaluations keep our Board going strong Our Independent Board Chair conducts annual performance evaluations for every one of our Board members. That way, we make sure all of our leaders are committed to McKesson\\'s values and future.\\nWe plan for what\\'s next in leadership Our Board reviews and provides input on our succession plan for developing our next generation of leaders, our CEO and executive officers. During FY19, the Board unanimously selected Brian Tyler, then president and chief operating officer of the company, to succeed John Hammergren as CEO, effective April 1, 2019. Brian is a 22-year McKesson veteran who has led nearly every major business within the company as well as McKesson\\'s corporate strategy and business development unit.\\nKey governance attributes include proxy access and the right to call a special meeting When our shareholders hold at least 3% of the company\\'s stock for at least three years, they can nominate director candidates to fill up to 20% of available Board seats. We also allow record holders who have held at least 15% of our outstanding shares for at least one year to call a special meeting of stockholders.\\nWe tell you about our political contributions and lobbying activities Transparency and accountability matter to us. In the U.S., we voluntarily disclose corporate political contributions and file reports on lobbying activities where required by law. Additionally, we provide a list of trade associations with annual payments more than $50,000. We also prohibit trade organizations from using our contributions for political purposes. In 2019, we further enhanced our political contributions and lobbying policy for the third consecutive year in response to shareholder feedback and include more prominent disclosure of our public policy approach and priorities.\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nAs one of the largest government contractors in the U.S., McKesson is proud to partner with government customers to meet the healthcare needs of veterans, active military, children and disadvantaged groups.\\nSince 2002, women have held three seats on our Board.\\n>Table of Contents|7\\n\\x0cOur Approach to Corporate Responsibility\\n\\nRisk oversight is a top priority The entire Board and their committees work to understand and review our corporate risks. They oversee everything from our reputation and legal and financial reporting risk to compensation practices and cybersecurity.\\nWe have a global Code of Conduct As described earlier in this report, our Code of Conduct is where we detail the policies and procedures that shape our work. It helps our entire team make ethical decisions. We\\'ve adapted and translated our code to make sure it works in every place we do.\\nGuidelines help us keep up with governance Our Corporate Governance Guidelines set forth our Board\\'s goal of building long-term value for our stockholders and are consistent with New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing requirements. Our guidelines call for the Board to monitor the performance of our company, including with respect to Environmental, Social and Governance matters, and our guidelines. They include things like:\\n Director qualification standards\\n Access to management and independent advisors\\n Compensation\\n Director orientation\\n Continuing education\\n Management succession\\n\\nOur Board members are independent Other than CEO Brian Tyler, every one of our Board members is independent, which follows the NYSE requirements and our Corporate Governance Guidelines.\\nThe Board reviews our corporate responsibility practices The Board of Directors periodically reviews our company\\'s corporate responsibility practices, including environmental sustainability, pay equity and diversity and inclusion.\\nWe do more to earn trust  We do not have a poison pill.\\n We eliminated supermajority voting requirements.\\n We have a majority voting standard for uncontested director elections.\\nIf you have any questions about McKesson\\'s governance, let us know.\\n\\nWe\\'ve adapted and translated our Code of Conduct to make sure it works every place we do.\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\n>Table of Contents|8\\n\\x0cOur Approach to Corporate Responsibility\\n\\nHow We Put Together This Report\\nIn FY18, we worked with our stakeholders on a materiality assessment, which is a process to identify and prioritize potential topics that could affect our company.\\nThe assessment included in-depth interviews and surveys with 95 stakeholders from Canada, Europe and the U.S. They included employees, customers, suppliers, industry associations, government agencies, NGOs and joint venture partners. We involved senior leaders from multiple business units and corporate functions and sought out the perspectives of our shareholders.\\nWe also brought in peer benchmarking, impact mapping, synthesis and analysis of our results. The work resulted in a materiality matrix, validated with internal leaders, and a list of prioritized topics and opportunities raised through the materiality process.\\nThrough the assessment, we identified the following topics as particularly material to McKesson: product quality and patient safety; eco-efficient transport and operations; ethics and compliance; partnerships and engagement; access to healthcare and community health; and employee recruitment, engagement and retention. Based on the assessment, we developed a global corporate responsibility report that puts emphasis on the following three topics:\\n1. Product quality and patient safety\\n2. Eco-efficient transportation and operation\\n3. Better health for employees and communities\\nYou\\'ll find a section on each as you keep reading.\\n\\nWhat is Corporate Responsibility?\\n\\nProduct Quality & Patient Safety\\nManaging Risk\\n Ensuring a sustainable future of healthcare  Collaborating with our partners\\n\\nOUR VISION\\nBetter Health for All\\n\\nEco-Efficiency\\nReducing Footprint and Cost\\n Reducing our environmental footprint  Finding smart solutions\\n\\nBetter Health\\nAdvancing Care for All\\n Investing in patients, colleagues and customer success\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\n>Table of Contents|9\\n\\x0cOur Approach to Corporate Responsibility\\nWhat you\\'ll find here This report is a deep dive into our corporate responsibility efforts during FY19 (April 1, 2018, to March 31, 2019). We issue a report each year.\\nThe report covers the good we\\'re doing in the countries where we operate. That includes our work in Canada, Europe and the United States.\\nFor more information about our operations, including joint ventures, subsidiaries, leased facilities, outsourced operations and other entities that can significantly affect comparability, please refer to the FY19 10-K, McKesson\\'s Annual Report.\\nThe Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework We\\'ve prepared our report in accordance with the \"Core\" version of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards.

It\\'s crucial to deliver the safest products to all of these patients, because both the people making the medicine and the people taking it count on us.\\nResponding to the opioid epidemic in the U.S. Each day, our distribution team delivers life-saving medicines to pharmacies, hospitals and clinics that serve millions of Americans. We take to heart that at the end of each and every item delivered -- every pill bottle, every vial, every ointment -- there is a patient in need. We know that it\\'s not just a package, it\\'s a patient.\\nOver the past decade, as the opioid epidemic evolved rapidly, we enhanced our teams, processes and technologies dedicated to preventing diversion. We are committed to maintaining -- and continuously enhancing -- strong programs designed to detect and prevent opioid diversion within the pharmaceutical supply chain, while also protecting the availability of appropriate treatments for patients with serious illnesses and injuries.\\nThis complicated, multi-faceted public health crisis must be addressed through a comprehensive and collaborative approach. Each participant in the pharmaceutical supply chain can play an important role.\\nWe have advanced a series of company initiatives focused on helping to address the opioid epidemic, including launching a foundation dedicated to combating the crisis, offering thoughtful public policy recommendations -- including the Prescription Safety-Alert System (RxSAS) technology proposal -- to supporting innovative programs and partnerships that we believe can have a meaningful impact on this challenging issue.\\n\\nWe are committed to engaging with all who share our dedication to acting with urgency to address this epidemic and working together to end this national crisis.\\nEnsuring products are safe and high quality Our quality management system is based on international procedures to ensure that products we handle and distribute, as well as the products we manufacture in our private-label line of business, follow applicable regulations.\\n\\nTransportation\\n\\nManufacturer\\n\\nDistribution Center\\n\\nCustomer/ Patient\\n\\nTransportation\\n\\nHospital/ Pharmacy\\n\\nMcKesson Taking Action Learn more about how we are doing our part in The Fight Against Opioid Abuse.\\nOur corporate responsibility strategy focuses on how our business affects society and the environment.

These include the Drug Supply Chain Security Act in the U.S., the Food and Drugs Act in Canada, and the Good Distribution Practice and Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines in Europe.\\nThese laws and regulations commit us to keeping our products traceable, handling hazardous products appropriately and continuing to work with authorized trading partners.\\n Product integrity: Our supply chain security, safety and security-training programs focus on the integrity of product packaging and containers. Here\\'s how:\\n When receiving products, we verify the quantity, supplier name and product name through the purchase order. We also make sure that the product is not set to expire soon. Our tracking system automatically lets us know if a supply is affected by a recall.\\n When shipping products, we use containers that maintain quality and safety and ensure appropriate temperature control. To manage cold chain products, we use sophisticated technology for environmental controls and temperature monitoring. Refrigeration experts ensure we select shipping containers that comply with manufacturers\\' product specifications. When we use passive cold chain solutions, we require containers to pass a qualification process. This helps guarantee product integrity and prevent any quality issues.\\n When potential incidents happen, we work to respond promptly. We follow a Corrective Action  Preventive Action (CAPA) process. To prevent counterfeit products from\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nWe ship products in containers that ensure the integrity and quality of the drug are maintained at all times.\\n\\n>Table of Contents|12\\n\\x0cProduct Quality and Patient Safety Come First\\n\\nentering the legal distribution network, we follow a supplier qualification procedure for vendors. As part of this process, we perform regular audits and checks of authorizations and certifications.\\n During product recalls, we reach out to pharmacies and other customers with details on the recall and how products can be returned to McKesson. We continuously train our customer service employees so they are up-to-date on current recalls.\\n Traceability: In Europe, we follow the Falsified Medicines Directive, which requires batch tracking of certain medicinal products. When products enter the warehouse, we record the product code, expiration date and batch number. Using handheld terminals, we track the product at every stage of its journey in the warehouse -- from replenishment, to picking, to returns. If an inaccuracy occurs, the tracking system generates an alert. Our quality coordinators monitor the alerts and resolve any inconsistencies.\\n Supplier requirements: Just as we hold ourselves accountable, we also hold our suppliers accountable for the quality of their products and services. In areas where we outsource distribution, this includes contracted carriers and couriers.\\nIn the U.S., Canada and Europe, suppliers meet our requirements through compliance with regional, national and international legislation. For other regions, please see \"Responsible sourcing\" below.\\n Manufacturer requirements: We comply with manufacturer requirements for handling and distributing products. In some cases, we have contracts with manufacturers that restrict the sale of certain medicines to certain customers, such as\\n\\nprison systems and others, for lethal injections. McKesson is committed to helping manufacturers implement their policies in this area. The needs and requirements of various manufacturers are different, so our contractual commitments, controls and processes vary by manufacturer. McKesson has processes and systems to enable manufacturers to validate our performance against our contractual arrangements.\\nWhen we manage quality, our guide isn\\'t only laws and regulations but also best practices and international standards. For example, 10 of our businesses in Europe are ISO 9001 certified. ISO 9001 is an international standard for quality management systems.\\nResponsible sourcing We work with private-label suppliers outside the U.S., Canada and the European Union. Those suppliers must agree to McKesson Sustainable Supply Chain Principles (MSSP). The MSSP covers compliance with appropriate laws along with adherence to our strict policies on protecting workers, preparing for emergencies, identifying and managing environmental risk, and protecting the environment. These principles reflect our stance against forced and child labor, which we articulate in our response to the UK Modern Slavery Act.\\nIn the U.S. and Canada, before we place the first order with a new supplier, we conduct desktop or on-site audits depending on a risk matrix analysis. These audits cover all MSSP areas. On-site audits include document review, a factory tour and interviews with workers. In either case, we document the findings and require a corrective action plan for any instances of non-compliance.\\nAdherence by suppliers to MSSP is not optional. McKesson Global Procurement & Sourcing Limited (MGPSL) is stringent in regard to remediation efforts. These are made by suppliers\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nWhen we manage quality, our guide is not only laws and regulations but also best practices and international standards.\\n>Table of Contents|13\\n\\x0cProduct Quality and Patient Safety Come First\\nwhen audits reveal any gaps in working conditions, health and safety, or environmental standards. To maintain high sustainable principles standards in factories we purchase products from, we follow up periodically on initial audits and closely monitor corrective actions.\\nWhen issues are identified, McKesson auditors work with the supplier to ensure improvements are made. These audits include interviews with workers and management, inspections of production sites, and document reviews. Audit findings or non-conformances are prioritized based on risk. Should a critical issue be identified, MGPSL would require a timely response from the supplier. If a supplier failed to adequately remediate the issue, the relationships would be re-evaluated and, if necessary, terminated.\\nQuality improvement through Six Sigma Across McKesson, we strive to continuously improve by using Six Sigma. Six Sigma helps us work better by using data to drive decision making and promote continuous quality improvement across our company. Using problem-solving tools, Six Sigma reduces defects and minimizes variances.\\nBy improving processes, we can see fewer errors, faster cycle time and less waste.\\nIn FY19, McKesson completed 405 Six Sigma projects, which had more than $160 million in cost savings and avoidance across our company, suppliers and customers.\\nOne of Six Sigma\\'s key objectives is to train, coach, and mentor employee talent, in order to deepen the operational excellence culture across McKesson. In FY19, employees in the countries covered by our centralized learning management system completed 1,269 Six Sigma training courses.\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nSix Sigma helps us work better by using data to drive decision making and by promoting continuous quality improvement across our company.\\n\\n>Table of Contents|14\\n\\x0cProduct Quality and Patient Safety Come First\\n\\nHere are a few of our Six Sigma projects:\\n Driving enhanced value through the supply chain: In FY19, the U.S. Six Sigma team completed five customer and supplier engagements that focused on the supply chain, from enhancing communication with the customers and suppliers to increasing service level metrics and improving cycle time for resolution of open items.\\n Reducing paper by going digital: In 2018, a Lean Six Sigma Green Belt project paved the way into the digital future: When medicines are delivered, there is a number of documents that must be printed out and enclosed with the delivery according to fullfill official requirements. The Portuguese LSS colleagues challenged those requirements in order to make a step towards the future. The idea: Saving paper consumed by digitizing the documents. In order to get green light for this aimed change the project team closely collaborated with the Portuguese legal authorities. Although the official requirements initially insisted on the printed version, the Portuguese team was able to convince the authorities to digitize this step. This LSS initiative has a positive impact on the company\\'s carbon footprint and was well as on the pharmacies receiving the digital documents, who now have less paper waste.\\n Tracking to better control precursor returns: Precursors are products with active pharmaceutical ingredients that can be used to make illegal drugs, such as methamphetamine. As part of McKesson Canada\\'s commitment to Health Canada, Six Sigma led a team to create an automated tracking system. It provides visibility along each step of a precursor return -- from when the product is created and shipped to the customer to when the physical return comes back into the McKesson building for processing.\\n\\nThese are just a few of our Six Sigma successes. Whether it\\'s reducing defects or streamlining processes, we look forward to tackling additional projects in FY20 and beyond.\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nIn FY19, McKesson completed 405 Six Sigma projects, which had more than $160 million in cost savings and avoidance across our company, suppliers and customers.\\n>Table of Contents|15\\n\\x0cEco-Efficient Operations and Transportation\\nCommunities thrive in a healthier environment. That\\'s why we\\'re sharpening our focus on environmental sustainability. Establishing new environmental best practices is a priority across McKesson businesses. We work to capture the metrics most relevant to our lines of business and act on recommendations that lead to a healthier environment. We use electricity for lighting and IT. We also use fuel for heating and transportation, including inbound and outbound distribution and business travel. We focus on efficiency across these areas. In our distribution centers and pharmacies, we focus on reducing energy use and finding alternative sources of energy. As a company focused on distribution, transportation is important to us -- in particular, fuel efficiency for our fleet.\\nReducing Energy Use in Our Facilities\\nAcross our locations, we work to use less energy for lighting and heating. Increasing LED lighting to lessen our footprint Our buildings use energy mainly for lighting. In our distribution centers, lighting accounts for up to 40% of the electricity consumption. In our pharmacies, it\\'s approximately 5070%. With more efficient lighting, we can cut our CO2 emissions and reduce our carbon footprint. During FY19, we implemented initiatives to add LED lighting in our distribution centers, pharmacies and offices. Through these initiatives, we expect to see energy reductions of up to 40%. Our European distribution centers expect to save more than 3,300 tons of CO2 emissions per year through LED lighting alone.\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nOur Sustainability Initiatives\\n\\n1 Increasing LED lighting across facilities\\n\\n2 Monitoring and benchmarking energy use\\n\\n3 Pursuing environmental certification\\n\\n4\\n\\nReducing movement of inventory through our redistribution center model\\n\\n5 Recycling and reusing resources\\n\\n4 5\\n\\n3 2\\n1\\n>Table of Contents|16\\n\\x0cEco-Efficient Operations and Transportation\\n\\nWhile we\\'re bringing LED lighting to more than 350 pharmacies in Europe, we\\'re also replacing inefficient heating systems with more efficient units, complete with timer controls and/or presence detectors. This initiative follows a successful pilot, where we helped 50 pharmacies save energy equal to 200 tons of CO2 emissions yearly.\\nMonitoring and benchmarking energy use We use a number of tools to benchmark our energy use, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\\'s Energy Star Portfolio Manager. In many distribution centers, we also monitor energy consumption by production line, which helps us find more opportunities to conserve and cut energy use.\\nBringing in renewable energy to move toward the future In our warehouses in Belgium, we switched from purchasing electricity that was generated from traditional sources to renewable energy from FY17 onward. Three of these Belgian warehouses are equipped with solar panels and generate approximately 700 MWh of clean electricity every year.\\nIn the U.S., we signed a long-term agreement to purchase solar power from solar arrays. We began installing these arrays in West Sacramento, California, during FY19. We expect the agreement to reduce costs for McKesson, producing electricity equal to approximately 74% of the West Sacramento facility\\'s annual consumption.\\nWorking toward environmental certifications as we grow As part of our energy reduction strategy, we pursue environmental certification for new and newly renovated buildings. For example, our European headquarters in Stuttgart was recognized by the German Sustainable Business Council for its environmentallyfriendly design. Our U.S. offices in San Francisco, California;\\n\\nIrving, Texas; The Woodlands, Texas; and Richmond, Virginia are Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified, as is our distribution center in Aurora, Illinois; we are pursuing LEED certification for our Scottsdale, Arizona; Jacksonville, Florida; and Columbus, Ohio offices. We also hold WELL certification for our Irving and Richmond offices and are pursuing it in Columbus, Jacksonville and Scottsdale.\\nTransportation: More Efficiency, Less Impact More output with less energy input -- this is the principle of energy efficiency. It makes perfect business sense because we save money by reducing our energy needs. At the same time, we reduce our impact on the environment by using fewer resources, which means we emit less CO2.\\nTransportation in our operations We\\'re an international business focused on distribution. For us, fuel consumption for transportation is an environmental challenge and opportunity. Our strategy focuses on optimizing delivery routes and the use of delivery vehicles. To do that, we monitor mileage and fuel consumption, and we educate our drivers on eco-efficient driving.\\nEnergy reduction for outsourced fleets In areas where we outsource transportation, we take advantage of external carriers\\' ability to optimize schedules and avoid returning empty trucks to distribution centers. We also work with customers to adjust delivery schedules to be more efficient.\\nEnergy reduction for our in-house fleet In some areas, we own our fleet. When buying new vehicles, key criteria are fuel consumption and low CO2 emissions -- while adhering to high quality standards. We teach our drivers environmentally friendly and safe practices, such as driving\\n\\nOur U.S. offices in San Francisco, California; Irving, Texas; The Woodlands, Texas; and Richmond, Virginia are LEED certified.\\nIn our warehouses in Belgium, we switched from purchasing ordinary electricity to 100% renewable energy starting in FY17.\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\n>Table of Contents|17\\n\\x0cEco-Efficient Operations and Transportation\\nat a safe speed limit and avoiding idling. We also adjust delivery routes and vehicle loading to cut mileage and increase efficiency. Our fleet in Canada\\'s Quebec province has already seen the impact:  Equipment upgrades: We have a multi-year initiative to\\nupgrade our line-haul tractors and 5-ton vehicles. The annual fuel reduction is approximately 95,000 liters.  Using LCVs: We use long combination vehicles (LCV) in our line-haul network in Quebec. LCVs use less fuel to carry goods, which reduces our carbon footprint. Redistribution Center model We operate National Redistribution Centers (NRDCs) in the U.S. and France. These centers help us to better manage our inventory and reduce redundancies. Even better, they help us reduce the movement of our inventory. In turn, we can save on costs and fuel within our distribution center network. Employee travel and commuting For travel to the office, we encourage employees to use sustainable options, like bikes or buses. In North America and several European countries, McKesson also offers commuter benefits, which let employees use pre-tax dollars to pay for items like subway cards or train tickets. In Canada, our Montreal office has reserved parking spaces for people who carpool. Several sites in Canada and Europe offer electric/hybrid car charging stations. While business travel is part of how we work, it also affects the environment. To reduce our impact, we encourage employees to use tele- and video-conferencing whenever possible to reduce travel and, by extension, our carbon footprint.\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nWe\\'re upgrading the tractors in our line-haul network in Canada. The annual fuel reduction is approximately 95,000 liters.\\n\\n>Table of Contents|18\\n\\x0cEco-Efficient Operations and Transportation\\n\\nC02 Emissions Performance in FY19\\n Scope 1: Direct emissions from the consumption of natural gas, heating oil, diesel fuel and gasoline. Our Scope 1 emissions increased by 25% from FY18. We believe that an important factor was a particularly cold winter in North America, which increased use of heating oil. The number of sites reporting natural gas consumption also increased. However, we saw a decrease in fuel consumption in our fleet, which we attribute to increased use of hybrid vehicles.\\n Scope 2: Emissions from purchased and consumed electricity and long-distance heating consumption. Our Scope 2 emissions decreased by 3% from FY18, driven by a decrease in electricity consumption in Europe and the U.S.\\n Scope 3: In FY19, we saw a substantial reduction in employee air travel, which led to an 11% reduction in CO2 emissions from FY18. These figures reflect air travel booked through our corporate travel partners.\\nWe measure CO2 emissions using the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.\\n\\nScope 1: Fuel consumption for in-house Pharmaceutical Solutions & Services, Medical-Surgical, Canada and Europe fleets; natural gas consumption in U.S., Canada and Europe facilities; heating oil in Canada and Europe facilities\\nScope 2: Electricity Consumption in U.S., Canada and Europe Facilities\\nScope 3: U.S., Canada and Europe employee air travel; third-party transportation\\n\\nFY18 CO2 emissions\\n(metric tons)\\n\\nFY19 CO2 emissions\\n(metric tons)\\n\\n124,911\\n\\n157,076\\n\\n178,385 75,506\\n\\n173,390 67,114\\n\\nConserving Resources in Our Daily Work\\nWe use a variety of resources in our work. Besides power sources, we use office paper, packaging, water and materials related to distribution. We do our best to use only what we need. When we can\\'t avoid using resources, we strive to use recycled products.\\n\\nUse of resources: FY18FY19* Material Recycled\\n\\nFY18: U.S. and Canada 15,307 tons\\n\\nMaterials to Landfill\\n\\nNot reported\\n\\nWater use\\n\\n366,786,967 liters\\n\\n*For all locations reporting recycling and/or water use data\\n\\nFY19: U.S., Canada and Europe 48,147 tons 19,129 tons 633,370,008 liters\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\n>Table of Contents|19\\n\\x0cEco-Efficient Operations and Transportation\\n\\nResource scarcity doesn\\'t affect only McKesson. Companies that aim to stay competitive in the long term must work toward closed-loop systems and use their resources responsibly. This approach makes sense from both an economic and an ecological point of view.\\nTo reduce our impact on the environment, we continuously improve the way we handle resources for our products, our services and our processes.\\nTo hold ourselves accountable, we report on the total weight of materials that were recycled and went to landfill, and on water use. In FY19, we added data from Europe. This will represent our new baseline for reporting.\\nReducing water use Water is a limited resource so we seek to reduce its use in our operations.\\nOne way we\\'re limiting water use is by expanding smart irrigation programs in our facilities. This system adjusts watering times based on weather conditions and lets us check our water use remotely. Users can receive notifications about changes to the settings or equipment malfunctions. Automation saves water because the irrigation system runs less often, and it is easier to identify problems. During FY19, we expanded smart irrigation programs to include five sites and saved enough water to fill 4.4 Olympic swimming pools each year.\\nHazardous waste In the U.S., our Hazardous and Regulated Waste Management Program establishes standards to identify and manage hazardous and regulated waste and handle hazardous and regulated waste spills. Through the program, we make sure that accumulation and disposal of waste from McKesson facilities complies with international, national and regional regulations.\\n\\nWhen it comes to e-waste, we partner with certified suppliers for both leased and non-leased assets. Leased electronic assets make up the bulk of our portfolio. Upon return, most are wiped clean and reused. If they can\\'t be reused, the parts are recycled. In Germany, we work with AfB to ensure that electronic assets are either resold or recycled. AfB is Europe\\'s first nonprofit IT company, and it focuses on providing employment opportunities for disabled workers.\\nWe also report on total hazardous waste for McKesson Europe. In FY19, we generated 1,474 tons of hazardous waste, an increase from 750 tons in FY18. We believe this increase is due to more complete reporting across business lines and represents a new baseline.\\nTransport of reusable containers In many of our businesses, we send medication to customers -- including pharmacies and hospitals -- in reusable containers. After the containers are unloaded and emptied at their destination, we use them for the next delivery. Our return system guarantees a smooth pick-up process. By reusing containers, we save valuable resources and avoid unnecessary waste every day.\\nGreen decommissioning When consolidating office space or moving to a new location, furniture can often go to landfill. In FY19, we partnered with a vendor that recycles, resells and donates furniture instead. To date, we have completed projects in Houston, Texas; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and San Francisco, California. In the San Francisco project alone, we diverted 90 tons of waste and donated more than $38,000 of furniture to local nonprofits. The estimated CO2 offset as of the end of FY19 was 432 tons.\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nDuring FY19, smart irrigation programs expanded to five sites and saved enough water to fill 4.4 Olympic swimming pools each year.\\n>Table of Contents|20\\n\\x0cEco-Efficient Operations and Transportation\\n\\nReducing paper use in our operations By going digital, we\\'re using less paper. Our initiatives range from paperless invoices and two-sided printing, which will cut printing by 34 million sheets of paper, to electronic handheld scanners for packing orders in distribution centers. Our Canada distribution centers will all implement paperless paystubs by the end of FY20. When we can\\'t avoid using paper, we encourage use of recycled stock.\\nDonating unused medications and products to support patients Part of conserving resources means ensuring that unused medications and medical supplies go to people and organizations that can benefit from them.\\n When people purchase medications and don\\'t use them, valuable products can turn into trash. A group of pharmacists from Italy\\'s LloydsFarmacia decided to do something about that. They joined forces with the City of Bologna, the regional health authority and other pharmacies to form Farmaco Amico. They invite customers to bring in unused medications that are valid for at least six more months and in unopened packages. A nonprofit partner collects and sorts the products. Then the products go to organizations serving patients without access to healthcare, in Italy and beyond. Narcotics, medications that need refrigeration, and free samples aren\\'t included in the program. AIFA, Italy\\'s national prescription drug agency, monitors the process.\\n\\n Through our partnership with World Vision, McKesson\\'s Medical-Surgical business donated 229 pallets of supplies during FY19. These donations helped support important health initiatives in seven countries. They include programs that screen and treat young children in Somalia for malnutrition and promote better access to care for pregnant and nursing women in Zambia.\\n The returns teams at several distribution centers in Canada collect returned or damaged products and arrange for them to be donated to nonprofit outreach programs. They reduce waste while supporting their local communities.\\nComplying with laws and regulations Our environmental commitment begins by adhering to all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Just as we take great care in the safety and security of our products, services and people, we are careful and thoughtful to minimize the effect of our company operations on the environment.\\nDuring the period covered by this report (April 1, 2018, through March 31, 2019), McKesson was in material compliance with all applicable environmental regulations.\\n\\nIn FY19, McKesson\\'s Medical-Surgical business donated 229 pallets of supplies, supporting important health initiatives in seven countries.\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\n>Table of Contents|21\\n\\x0cCreating Better Health for Our Employees and Communities\\n\\nOur vision for a healthier world begins with patients and extends to our employees.

Labor laws and practices vary among the countries where we do business, and we are committed to following all applicable labor laws and regulations in those countries, including those governing labor-management relationships.\\nAdvancing employee well-being We offer programs that advance the physical, mental, financial and social well-being of our employees and their families. We focus on engaging all, and we measure our success through the annual global Employee Opinion Survey.\\nWe know healthcare systems are different in different countries, and our programs reflect that. For example, in Canada and the U.S., our programs include an annual health review, an interactive wellness portal and an employee assistance program. In those countries, we also provide free fitness trackers that connect to an online wellness platform, organize health challenges, and maintain a network of employee Wellness Champions. We also help employees plan for retirement, whether they\\'re far along in their career or just starting out.\\n\\nOpportunities to grow McKesson wants our employees to be excited about their careers, so we invest heavily in employee growth and development. That means rewarding job assignments, one-on-one feedback from managers and opportunities for continued learning.\\nWhen it comes to career development, we focus on shared goals and individualized feedback. Each goal ladders up to our overriding goal: to improve care in every setting -- one product, one partner, one patient at a time. We establish clear goals and regularly measure their achievement, and compensation increases are tied to their success. We encourage managers to provide ongoing coaching through discussions and quarterly check-in meetings. Through this process, managers provided formal feedback on 94% of eligible employees in the U.S. and Canada.\\nTraining is important to career development. It helps employees succeed in their roles and prepares them for new challenges. It strengthens managers\\' coaching and management skills. Besides classroom training, we also offer classes through telepresence and fully online on-demand courses, so employees can learn when it fits their schedules. In FY19, our employees completed more than 290,000 hours of training (across the countries that are included in our centralized learning management platform, including Canada, the U.S., and some employees in the UK and Ireland).\\nWe are always on the lookout for high-potential employees, and we have processes to help them advance.

START, GROW and DRIVE are for managers, while EXPERT supports specialists in expanding their knowledge and tackling increasingly complex challenges.\\nKeeping workplaces safe and secure Patient and employee safety is the foundation for all our work at McKesson. That\\'s why we incorporate health and safety into all parts of our operations.\\nWe start by being proactive. Our Security and Safety department in the U.S. continually monitors our environment to identify potential risks, so we can prevent and mitigate them. That includes having procedures in place and investing in equipment for physical and electronic security.\\nIn North America, we routinely assess all of our key facilities to make sure they follow our established security and safety standards. If we identify a vulnerability, we document it and the facility prepares a plan to address it. Across distribution facilities, we prepare a monthly Leading Safety Indicator Dashboard to measure conformance to our standards.\\nIn FY19, our distribution centers in the U.S. had a 96.9% effectiveness rate in core injury-prevention programs, including joint health and safety committees, periodic self-inspections, and employee training.\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nIn FY20, we will continue to provide a safe and secure work environment for our employees and, by extension, for the customers and patients who depend on us.\\n\\n>Table of Contents|24\\n\\x0cCreating Better Health for Our Employees and Communities\\n\\nReducing workplace injuries The first step to reducing workplace injuries is preventing them. In distribution centers, we focus on initiatives like safe lifting and pre-shift stretching. We focus on ergonomic design, as well as slip, trip and fall prevention.\\nIn the U.S., injury rates (number of recordable injuries per 100 employees) improved in both distribution centers and offices during FY19. Total recordable injuries declined by 11% and losttime injuries declined by 15%. In Canada, the injury frequency rate remained the same from FY18 and the severity index declined. In FY19, we gathered safety data from Europe as a baseline, and plan to expand safety reporting to include Europe starting with our FY20 corporate responsibility report.\\nTraining is the cornerstone of safety Across McKesson North America, we foster a \"working together, protecting together\" culture. Our safety training programs are for employees at all levels. Throughout their time at McKesson, employees learn to identify and control hazards they may encounter at work or at home. They also receive specialized training related to their role, environment or the equipment they use. Just as we continually update our processes, we update and add new training programs, and we train managers to coach employees on safe work practices. In FY19, U.S. employees completed over 25,000 safety training courses.\\nIn FY20, we will continue to provide a safe and secure work environment for our employees and, by extension, for the customers and patients who depend on us.\\n\\nAccess to Healthcare\\nAcross our company, we champion programs that help people access quality healthcare at a lower cost. Here are a few examples:\\n Bringing online doctors to patients: In the UK, our LloydsPharmacy business offers online access to healthcare. Patients go to the website, choose a medication they would like to receive, and answer a series of questions. That information is examined by a doctor, who runs it through a sophisticated clinical algorithm that determines if it is safe to prescribe the medication. If the doctor needs to know more, he or she can send a personalized message to the patient in seconds. After the doctor approves the medication, he or she electronically signs the prescription. Patients can opt to either pick it up or have it delivered to their home. To keep the algorithms as safe and efficient as possible, they\\'re constantly updated. Besides convenience and less wait time, this service gives patients discretion for sensitive topics, such as hair-loss treatment and sexual health.\\n Bringing electronic health records to First Nations families: In Canada, Jordan\\'s Principle is a legal rule designed to make sure First Nations families have equal access to healthcare. The Cowichan Tribes of Vancouver Island realized that without access to their own health information, it would be difficult to take an active role in their own healthcare. That\\'s why they partnered with McKesson Canada\\'s RelayHealth on Closing the Circle of Care. The project honors the tribes\\' teachings, which include working collectively for improved health. With RelayHealth, tribe members now have secure access to their health records, along with the ability to directly message their healthcare providers online.\\n\\nBy helping people access quality healthcare at lower cost, we help make better health possible.\\nIn the U.S., McKesson\\'s Health Mart business supports more than 5,000 pharmacies across the country, with nearly 30% located in rural communities.\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\n>Table of Contents|25\\n\\x0cCreating Better Health for Our Employees and Communities\\n\\n Caring for patients in rural settings: Rural areas often have an older population with a greater need for managing medications, yet they have less access to pharmacy services. In the U.S., McKesson\\'s Health Mart business supports more than 5,000 pharmacies across the country, with nearly 30% located in rural communities. Health Mart is a franchise program that helps independent pharmacies compete with chain and mail-order pharmacies. McKesson helps Health Mart pharmacies get competitive reimbursement rates. Other services include branding, in-store marketing advice and peer support. Keeping rural pharmacies healthy is only part of the story. In many communities, the pharmacist is the first line of defense for patients. Yet regulations are inconsistent across U.S. states. For example, pharmacists can give vaccinations in some states but not in others. In the U.S., McKesson advocates with policymakers for consistent licensing rules across states. The goal is to make care more accessible -- and help shift it to lower-cost settings.\\nCaring for Our Communities\\nGiving back is a great way to build healthier communities. We provide opportunities that encourage and support employee volunteering and giving. Our programs are built to reflect our focus on better care, whether that means celebrating our Community Heroes or responding to emergencies.\\nGiving back, with a focus on better health In 2019, McKesson launched and seeded with $100 million, a national, private, grantmaking foundation focused solely on advancing solutions to the opioid crisis. FORE, the Foundation for Opioid Response Efforts, works to identify actions that can be taken to stem the epidemic and drive meaningful solutions,\\n\\nsuch as focusing on education for patients, caregivers and providers; addressing key policy issues; and increasing access to life-saving treatments. It is overseen by a board mostly comprised of outside directors, including healthcare and subject-matter experts, to ensure FORE\\'s work reflects diverse perspectives and approaches to addressing this epidemic.\\nIn FY19, McKesson Corporation contributed $2.3 million in cash and merchandise to support a variety of charitable organizations in the U.S., Canada and Europe. The McKesson Foundation disbursed more than $3.7 million to support cancer care and employees\\' community engagement efforts across the U.S. and Canada.\\nHere are some of the areas we focused on in FY19:\\n Supporting cancer patients: In North America, the McKesson Foundation works with a network of Cancer Care Community Partners. These nonprofits are located near where our employees live and work. We support these partners through Giving Comfort, a charity program that has provided care packages to more than 76,000 cancer patients.\\nEmployees create the care packages during Community Days, an annual volunteering event that drew 16,750 employees in 150 locations in FY19. By volunteering, employees also earn McKesson Foundation grants for their local Community Partner.\\nThey also support the partners through McKesson in Motion, a charity wellness challenge that engaged more than 10,500 employees. During the challenge, employees completed workouts to support the fight against cancer. By participating, they earned McKesson Foundation grants for our Community Partners -- just as they do for Community Days.\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nFor the past three years, LloydsApotek has made annual donations to Ung Cancer (Young Cancer), which provides support to young cancer patients, in lieu of other holiday gift-giving.\\n>Table of Contents|26\\n\\x0cCreating Better Health for Our Employees and Communities\\nWe could not bring these programs to life without the 257 employees across Canada and the U.S. who serve as Regional Volunteer Chairs across McKesson offices and distribution centers. They organize local events and inspire their colleagues to join our companywide volunteer programs.\\nIn Europe, both our businesses and their employees showed their support for cancer nonprofits. For example, our LloydsApotek business in Sweden surveyed its employees to identify the nonprofits they most wished to support. Their top pick was Ung Cancer (Young Cancer), which provides psychosocial and community support to young cancer patients. For the past three years, LloydsApotek has made annual donations to the organization in lieu of other holiday gift-giving. In Germany, our GEHE business donates to PRIMAKLIMA, a nonprofit that organizes an annual camp to provide support and community for children fighting cancer.\\n Growing the international marrow registry: In the U.S., we continue to partner with the Gift of Life Bone Marrow Registry to grow our McKesson Marrow Drive. Together, we\\'ve added more than 5,200 committed donors to the international registry. Employees register during voluntary biometric screenings, refer friends and family, and organize drives in the community. We also sponsor drives at partner universities. The registry urgently needs donors of diverse backgrounds, and we have partnered closely with McKesson\\'s employee resource groups to help get the donors they need. As of the end of FY19, the drive has led to 26 matches and five transplants. Interest is growing across our company. In late FY19, our GEHE business in Germany started a marrow drive in partnership with DKMS, an international nonprofit. Starting at their headquarters office, it has already expanded to several of GEHE\\'s warehouses.\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nTogether, we\\'ve added more than 5,200 committed donors to the international registry.

In FY19, these were again close to home in the U.S., as many found themselves in the paths of Hurricanes Florence and Michael and in California, our neighbors faced massive and deadly fires.\\nWhen natural disasters appear likely, we act quickly. McKesson contacts customers and first responders to encourage them to order additional inventory. We prepare our facilities for difficult conditions and stock extra medication and supplies, such as vaccines for first responders. We partner with government agencies to help our drivers access roads, so patients can receive the medications they need.\\nIn addition, we support disaster relief through our Taking Care of Our Own Fund, a relief fund that supports our people when the unexpected happens. Since 2013, it has provided cash grants to employees who face hardship after sudden and severe events, including natural disasters and personal hardships. It is supported by donations from McKesson and the McKesson Foundation, as well as from employees.\\nIn FY19, as part of the Taking Care of Our Own Fund, we introduced $1,000 Get You to Safety grants to provide evacuation assistance to employees. The grant money is wired within 24 hours for qualified government-declared disasters. In addition, we expanded the Fund to McKesson Canada. During the fiscal year, these grants supported more than 180 McKesson employees affected by Hurricanes Florence and Michael, as well as California fires, and floods in the Midwest and Quebec. In total, the Fund supported 393 employees with more than $842,000 in grants in FY19.\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nPhilanthropy Highlights\\nAssisted 393 employees through the McKesson Foundation Taking Care of Our Own Fund\\n$88,000 awarded in board service grants\\nDonated $1 million+ through employee matching gifts program\\n651 students supported and $2.8 million donated for scholarships since 1988\\nAdded more than 5,200 potential donors to the international marrow registry since start of McKesson Marrow Drive\\n>Table of Contents|29\\n\\x0cGRI Content Index\\n\\nGRI Standard/ Disclosure\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nGRI 101\\n\\nFoundation 2016\\n\\nGRI 102\\n\\nGeneral Disclosure 2016\\n\\nOrganizational Profile\\n\\n102-1\\n\\nName of the Organization\\n\\n102-2 102-3\\n\\nActivities, brands, products and services\\nLocation of headquarters\\n\\n102-4\\n\\nLocation of operations\\n\\n102-5 102-6 102-7 102-8\\n102-9 102-10\\n102-11\\n102-12\\n\\nOwnership and legal form\\nMarkets served\\nScale of the organization\\nInformation on employees and other workers Supply chain\\nSignificant changes to the organization and its supply chain Precautionary principle or approach External initiatives\\n\\nPage/Comment\\nMcKesson Corporation, p.5 p.5\\nOur headquarters are at 6555 State Highway 161, Irving, Texas, U.S. McKesson has significant operations in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Walmart Investors\\n3\\nA message from our Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWhy are we doing this?\\nWhy are we launching big efforts like Project GigatonTM? Why did we set ambitious goals such as creating zero waste and using 100% renewable energy? Why, as a retailer, have a position on human rights? Why issue an Environmental, Social & Governance Report every year to track progress?\\nWell, as with many things at Walmart, the WHY of it starts with our founder, Sam Walton.\\nTwenty-seven years ago, President George H.W. Bush traveled to Bentonville to present Sam with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It was a pinnacle moment for Walmart, and our founder shared a few powerful and timeless thoughts. He provided a forward-looking purpose for our company that drives us today:\\n\"If we can, why, we\\'ll lower the cost of living for everyone -- not just in America, but we\\'ll give the world an opportunity to see what it\\'s like to save and have a better lifestyle and a better life for all.\"\\nSam said \"and.\" Our purpose is to help give people all over the world the opportunity to save \"... AND have a better lifestyle AND a better life for all.\" Some have described Sam as a merchant with a servant\\'s heart. During his life, he gave back to the communities where we had stores and, as the scale of the company has grown, our desire to strengthen communities and make a difference in the world continues on.\\n\\nSam made those comments in 1992. In 2005, our President and CEO Lee Scott painted a vision of \"21st Century Leadership\" and challenged us to expand our thinking and impact. He said, \"For us there is no distinction between being a responsible citizen and a successful business. They are one and the same for Walmart.\"\\nWhat Sam and Lee said applies now more than ever. We believe it\\'s important to run our business in a way that generates lasting value for our customers, our associates, our shareholders and for society more broadly.\\nTo many of us today, trust seems in short supply. Institutions, including business, especially big business, are being questioned. We see it in the headlines. We think that people want to trust again but, of course, trust has to be earned. People want to see companies doing good in the world, and people want to work for companies they believe in. Business should serve more than just one stakeholder group. It\\'s not enough to just serve shareholders or just serve customers; rather, the opportunity for businesses and their leadership is to add value for all stakeholders. We\\'ve felt that way for a long time and we\\'ve been taking action, but we\\'re challenging ourselves to make even better choices and do more.\\nWe\\'re investing in our associates through wages along with better educational opportunities, benefits and training. For example, since the first U.S. Walmart Academy opened in 2016, more than\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n4\\n800,000 associates have gone through training. And we expanded our parental-leave and adoption policies and raised starting wages again. As of last year, a fulltime hourly associate in the U.S. who gives birth to a child is eligible for up to 16 weeks of paid time away.\\nWe\\'re launching new efforts to be more sustainable. Earlier this year, we announced a plan to reduce plastic waste in the packaging for our private brands. By 2025, we aim to use 100% recyclable, reusable, or industrially compostable packaging for our private brands in the U.S.\\nWe\\'re continuing our fight against hunger. Four years ago, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation committed to providing 4 billion meals through funding and food donations by 2020. We are ahead of schedule.\\n\\nAnd we\\'re working to source responsibly and improve supply chain conditions. For example, we\\'re proud to be a founding member in 2013 of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which concluded its commitment last year. Over the past five years, 90% of high-priority remediation items were complete across all factories affiliated with the Alliance and almost 1.6 million workers have been trained in fire safety. We continue to collaborate with stakeholders to improve the lives of workers in the global supply chain.\\nIn the end, we all must answer one simple question: What valuable purpose did we serve? Either as an individual or as a company, which is simply a collection of individuals, what good did we do for the world?\\n\\nWalmart is nearing the end of its sixth decade. We\\'ve been around a while, and with longevity comes a perspective and vision beyond next week. We\\'re in it for the long haul. And we understand that for a business to last, it must have a fundamental reason for being, which is found in the value it creates for all-- customers, associates, communities, shareholders, suppliers, future generations ... and the planet. Remember, Sam said \"and.\" This is the And.\\nDoug McMillon President and Chief Executive Officer Walmart Inc.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n5\\nA message from our Chief Sustainability Officer\\n\\nBusiness exists to serve society.\\nFor Walmart, this is true in many ways: providing customers with convenient access to affordable food and other products; employing associates; helping suppliers grow their businesses that in turn employ others; generating tax dollars that help support community life; providing a return to shareholders.\\nThe most successful businesses do such things but go one step further -- they aim in the long term to improve the systems on which they rely, such as retail workforce development or food supply chains. Why? Not only to build customer trust, but also to enhance supply security, improve the quality of products and services, manage costs and expenses more effectively, generate new revenue streams, and attract and retain talent. Strengthening these systems is not only the responsible thing to do -- it maximizes business value.\\nBy many measures, there has never been a better time to be alive than today. Yet society faces many challenges. While global prosperity has increased, so has inequality; and studies point to a skills gap that needs to be addressed to help people advance economically, especially as evolving technologies change the nature of work. Meanwhile, increasing global demand is placing unsustainable pressure on\\n\\nthe climate and natural ecosystems, challenging us all to shift from a \"take-make-dispose\" system of production and consumption to a circular, regenerative approach.\\nThat\\'s why our approach to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues goes beyond minimizing our own footprint or mitigating risk. We take a more transformative approach: working to spark collective action in an effort to alter the sector in the long term for environmental, social and economic sustainability.\\nSo in the case of economic opportunity for retail associates, for example, we aim not only to help people enter the workforce with competitive wages, but also to help them build skills needed to advance, whether at Walmart or beyond. We want to build a skills-based employment system, with ladders of opportunity, at scale, that is inclusive and reflective of our communities.\\nAnd when it comes to human rights in supply chains, we aim not only to source responsibly, but also to work with others to rewire chains for social sustainability -- for example, improving Bangladesh factory safety through our work with the Alliance, or fighting modern slavery in seafood through our work with the Seafood Task Force and the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n6\\nWith respect to climate change, we want to address our own operations while galvanizing collective action across the retail supply chain to bend the curve on emissions -- working with suppliers in an attempt to avoid a gigaton of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 through initiatives in energy, waste, agriculture, packaging, natural capital and product design.\\nIn this report, you will find a summary of our aspirational goals and recent progress related to our priority ESG issues. For example, since our last report, we conducted our first climate risk assessment and\\n\\nhave advanced toward our science-based targets for emissions reduction; we have launched new initiatives in waste reduction, particularly related to plastic. Inspired by the United Nations (U.N.) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we published our first human rights statement to make it easier to see how we respect human rights across our business. We continue to strengthen our retail associate proposition and make strides working with others toward the social and environmental sustainability of multiple supply chains.\\n\\nAs always, we welcome your feedback and your collective action in helping to transform retail systems for long-term environmental, social and economic sustainability.\\nKathleen McLaughlin Chief Sustainability Officer, Walmart Inc. and President, Walmart Foundation\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n7\\nAbout this report\\n\\nWalmart has been reporting on a wide range of ESG topics since 2005. We did not seek, nor was there, external assurance from third parties with respect to most of the information in this report; exceptions are noted.\\nFrameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, the United Nations (U.N.) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) inspire our reporting.\\nWe also disclose to external reporting programs such as CDP. In 2018, we received an A- on our climate change disclosure.\\n\\nThis report covers the activities of Walmart for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2019 (FY2019) unless otherwise noted. This ESG Report responds to stakeholder requests for a more concise and focused view of our priority topics -- how we define them and the long-term strategy to manage them; our aspirational goals and targets; and progress to date. \"Walmart\" means Walmart Inc., a Delaware corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, excluding eCommerce subsidiaries, businesses, platforms and/or marketplaces, unless otherwise noted.\\n\\nWe provide additional information on a variety of ESG topics in the resources below:\\n\\nGlobal Ethics Human Rights Statement Global Responsibility website Walmart Sustainability Hub\\n\\nResponsible Sourcing Culture Diversity & Inclusion Report Corporate Policies Walmart.org\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n8\\nForward-looking statement\\nThis report contains certain forward-looking statements based on Walmart management\\'s current assumptions and expectations, including statements regarding our sustainability targets, goals, commitments and programs and other business plans, initiatives and objectives.

For example, better ESG practices can enhance customer trust, catalyze new product lines, increase productivity, reduce costs and secure future supply, while simultaneously improving livelihoods, advancing economic mobility and opportunity, reducing emissions and waste, and restoring natural capital.\\nSalient issues\\nWe set ESG priorities based on relevance to our company purpose, key categories and markets; Walmart\\'s ability to create change; and relative importance to our customers and other stakeholders.\\n\\nWhole-systems change\\nTo maximize shared value, we aim not only to run a good retail business, but also to make largescale and lasting improvements to the ecosystems most salient to our business. Walmart has a unique ability to make a difference through our strengths, including our approximately 2.2 million associates around the world, supplier relationships, jobs, purchase orders and expertise.\\nBusiness leadership\\nWe drive and track performance against our social and environmental priorities through our everyday business activities. For example, we track performance toward our diversity goals through our human resources activities, and toward our aspirational renewable energy goals through real estate and operations activities. ESG initiatives are embedded throughout our company in our business planning and performance management cycle, operating policies, organization roles and coordinating mechanisms, project governance, and systems and tools (e.g., the Sustainability Index).\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n10\\nAligned philanthropy\\nOur corporate giving and the Walmart Foundation\\'s programs complement our business initiatives by seeking to help accelerate social and environmental transformation. In FY2019, through a combination of in-kind and cash gifts, Walmart gave more than $1.4 billion to projects that create opportunity, enhance sustainability and strengthen communities.\\nCollective action\\nSince we believe that collective action is essential to transforming systems, we shape our ESG programs in collaboration with other leaders and stakeholders. Project Gigaton, the Retail Opportunity Network and the Sustainability Index are just a few examples of large-scale, system-wide collaborations we have helped create.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n11\\nDefining our ESG priorities, goals & targets\\n\\nOur ESG priorities are grounded in our long-term business strategy and account for macro-economic, social and environmental trends. These priorities are where we see the most opportunity for shared value.\\nStakeholders provide valuable insight into our priorities. In 2014, we formally engaged stakeholders through our materiality review process. The results informed our 2025 commitments, where we committed to progress in topics such as associate opportunity, social challenges in supply chains, environmental sustainability, human rights and community resiliency.\\nMateriality, as used in the context of this report and our materiality review process, is different than the definition used in the context of filings with the SEC. Issues deemed material for purposes of this report, and for purposes of determining our ESG strategies, may not be considered material for SEC reporting purposes.\\nWe conduct regular updates through ongoing stakeholder engagement and dialogue. We address numerous ESG issues through our business, in partnership with others and through philanthropy, and we provide information on those throughout this report. Three issues that rise to the top of our priority list include: (1) economic opportunity for Walmart associates; (2) the safety and livelihoods of workers in supply chains; and (3) climate change.\\n\\nEconomic opportunity\\nWorkforce development is one of the biggest issues facing economies around the world, especially as technology accelerates the pace of change for the jobs of today and tomorrow.\\nBecause the retail industry provides a point of entry into the job market for millions of workers, it has the potential to act as a springboard for economic mobility if workers can gain the experience and skills required to advance.\\nOur workforce development approach focuses on access, stability and mobility. For example, Walmart U.S. provides an entry point into work for thousands of associates; competitive wages and strong benefits (from healthcare to retirement savings); and access to affordable education opportunities relevant for advancement in retail jobs. With the emergence of automation and artificial intelligence, our training and development programs become even more relevant for workforce success, as they help equip associates with critical 21st century skills.\\nAs described in more detail later in this report, our efforts are underpinned by a commitment to fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion throughout our company. By investing in a more diverse and dynamic workforce, we hope to keep pace with evolving customer demands, while also acting as a force for economic inclusion.\\nLearn more in the Retail opportunity section.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n12\\nSocial issues in the supply chain\\nWith retail operations in 27 countries, Walmart\\'s supply chain includes more than 100,000 suppliers across the globe. Walmart respects human rights in the supply chain. Our Responsible Sourcing team, working with and through our suppliers, mitigates risks related to worker safety and well-being. We set expectations for our suppliers through our Standards for Suppliers and use audits to help assess whether our standards are being upheld. We also evaluate our global supply chain using internal and external data, risk assessments of particular regions, countries, commodities or products, and guidance from industry experts and non-governmental organizations.\\nRecognizing the need for whole-system transformation in a number of retail supply chains industry-wide, Walmart has committed to use our ability to bring together stakeholders including industries, civil society, governments and international organizations, to address the major potential risks to the dignity of workers in a minimum of 10 retail supply chains by 2025. Based on our analyses and where we believe Walmart can have the greatest impact, we\\'ve identified the following five supply chains:\\n Produce in the U.S. and Mexico\\n Shrimp in Thailand\\n Tuna processed in Thailand\\n Apparel in Bangladesh\\n Electronics sourced for the U.S. retail market supply chain\\nLearn more about our action in the Responsible supply chains section.\\n\\nClimate change\\nWe believe climate change is likely to affect national economies and supply chains around the world through potential effects such as lower crop yields, increased health costs and storm damage. According to The Sustainability Consortium, 60% of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide come from the global production and use of consumer goods. With operations and a value chain that span the globe, we aim to galvanize collective action to reduce emissions, while taking steps to strengthen the resilience of our business.\\nAccordingly, we have set a science-based target1 that covers our GHG emissions footprint: We aim to reduce emissions in our operations (Scopes 1 and 2) by 18% by 2025 from 2015 levels; and we are working with suppliers to reduce or avoid emissions in our supply chain by 1 gigaton by 2030 through an initiative known as Project Gigaton.\\nLearn more about our actions in the Climate change section.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n13\\nChallenges to achieving aspirational goals, commitments & targets\\n\\nThe aspirational goals, commitments and targets we set under priority topics are designed to help Walmart aim high, hold ourselves accountable and move at an aggressive pace. Our public ESG commitments galvanize action across our business through seniorlevel oversight, policies and programs. We hold ourselves accountable through metrics, measurement and annual reporting, including the annual publication\\n\\nof our ESG Report. In 2016, our CEO Doug McMillon announced our 2025 commitments and targets. These are laid out in greater detail at the beginning of the Environmental and Social sections of this report.\\nESG issues are complex. We believe that setting goals and driving action toward meeting them is necessary to advance progress on many environmental and\\n\\nsocial issues facing society. Because success depends on the collective efforts of many, as well as factors such as technical advances, policy changes, economic and price volatility, and supplier engagement, there may be times where we fall short. While we strive in each case to meet our goals and targets, sometimes challenges may delay or block progress.\\n\\nISSUE Climate change\\nSustainable supply chain\\nWaste\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES\\n\\nEXAMPLE CHALLENGES\\n\\n Public policies that affect supply or cost of renewable energy projects  Changes to local energy grids  Weather patterns increasing days requiring facility heating or cooling  Evolution of refrigeration technology  Shifts in Walmart asset base or category mix\\n\\n Supplier willingness and capacity to implement and measure emissions reductions projects\\n Lack of enforcement of laws and regulations  Innovation in manufacturing or agriculture technologies  Alignment of scientific community on measurement approaches\\n\\n Complexity of commodity supply chains\\n Innovation in manufacturing, agriculture and other product production technologies\\n Adoption of supply chain traceability practices and tools (e.g., vessel monitoring and blockchain)\\n\\n Pricing and availability of certified products  Supplier willingness and capacity to adopt sustainable practices  Financial trade-offs (e.g., cost, capital and revenue)  Materials innovation (e.g., flexible films)\\n\\n Data and insights into drivers of waste across the supply chain  Public policy regarding waste prevention and management  Quality of recycling and waste management infrastructure in local\\nmarkets  Volatility of market for recycled materials (demand, supply and cost)  Technological innovation in packaging materials, waste management\\n\\n Capital and operating cost of implementing waste management technologies\\n Alignment of industry around packaging solutions\\n Ability to scale waste management processes, tools and behaviors across thousands of facilities in multiple markets\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n14\\nISSUE\\nRetail opportunity\\nResponsible supply chains\\nSafer, healthier food & other products\\n\\nSOCIAL CHALLENGES\\nEXAMPLE CHALLENGES\\n Acceptance among retailers of the business case for investing in frontline upskilling\\n Engagement of associates in building capabilities relevant for advancement\\n Alignment among employers on the importance of building career pathways and credentials that reflect needed skills for advancement\\n\\n Evolution of cost-effective, practical tools to rapidly build skills among incumbent workers\\n Progress on inclusion in culture at large\\n\\n Upstream risks beyond the reach of traditional responsible sourcing tools\\n Complexity of supply chains\\n Diverse responsible sourcing stakeholders with sometimes conflicting expectations\\n\\n Emerging trends in country-by-country political landscape  Scope of international and local laws and regulations  Greater calls for transparency\\n\\n Consumer expectations and demand  Pace of innovation in product development\\n\\n Adoption of transparent labeling among suppliers  Data availability\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n15\\nStakeholder engagement\\n\\nAs a retailer, our company performance depends on direct and frequent engagement with our customers, associates and community leaders, as well as the people who supply our products, hold our stock and evaluate our performance.

To avoid the worst effects of climate change, the Paris Agreement calls for collective action across society to limit global temperature increases to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius.\\nAt Walmart, we are focused on reducing emissions in our operations, engaging suppliers to reduce emissions in supply chains, strengthening the resilience of our business and using our voice to advocate for collective action.\\nClimate change impact scenario analysis\\nTo better understand the nature of climate change and potential implications for the retail sector, we conducted a climate scenario analysis, working with an independent third-party consultant; we aimed to align with the scenario guidance set forth by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\\nThe analysis considered two scenarios for global warming: 2 C (the upper end of the range targeted by the Paris Agreement) and 4 C (often called \"business as usual\"). Each scenario looked out to the years 2030 and 2050, making assumptions about four climate variables: temperature, drought/water stress, extreme weather events and sea level. The analysis modeled potential effects of these variables on aspects of retail business operations such as store heating and cooling requirements; crop yields (e.g., bananas, corn, lettuce, tomatoes, wheat, cotton); and storm\\n\\ndamage to stores and distribution centers. The analysis made many simplifying assumptions. For example, each variable was considered in isolation. The analysis did not consider second- or third-order effects. It also did not consider potentially offsetting impacts of new technologies, mitigating actions or new business opportunities. While the limitations of the analysis mean that it can\\'t be used to predict net long-term impact on financials or business operations, it nevertheless helped to validate our current business strategies and initiatives for energy demand, commodity sourcing, value chain innovation, water management and resiliency. We discussed the analysis with teams across our business and the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Walmart Board. For more information on this analysis, please see our 2018 CDP climate change disclosure.\\nClimate change mitigation\\nWe believe mitigating the effects of climate change will require collective action to reduce GHG emissions. Because most emissions in the retail sector lie in product supply chains rather than in stores and distribution centers, we have committed to pursue substantial emissions reduction not only in our own operations but also across product supply chains, by catalyzing and supporting initiatives among suppliers, NGOs, customers and others at scale.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n21\\nSustainable operations\\nWe have set a science-based target12 to reduce GHG emissions in our own operations (Scopes 1 and 2) by 18% by 2025 (compared with 2015 levels) through multiple initiatives. These include increasing the energy efficiency of our buildings, aiming to power 50% of our operations with renewable energy by 2025, improving the performance of our refrigeration systems and maximizing the sustainability of our fleet.\\n\\nWe are on track to meet our goals. As of 2017, we had reduced emissions by 6.1% compared with 2015 levels.13 Also, renewable sources supplied an estimated 28% of our electricity needs globally;14 this includes generation from more than 520 projects across eight countries, 18 U.S. states and Puerto Rico. Based on our pipeline of solar and wind projects, we expect to source 35% of our electricity from renewables by 2020.\\n\\nAnnual greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1 & 2)15\\n\\nMillion MT COe\\n\\n25\\n\\n20\\n\\n6.76 6.11 6.65\\n\\n6.52\\n\\n15\\n\\n10\\n\\n12.16\\n\\n15.12 14.93 14.08\\n\\n5\\n\\n0\\n\\nCY2014\\n\\nCY2015\\n\\nCY2016\\n\\nCY2017\\n\\nScope 1\\n\\nScope 2\\n\\nCarbon intensity (Scopes 1 & 2)16\\n\\n$700,000 $600,000\\n\\n45.06\\n\\n43.63\\n\\n$500,000\\n\\n$400,000\\n\\n$300,000\\n\\n$200,000 $100,000\\n\\n$0\\n\\nFY2015\\n\\nFY2016\\n\\nTotal annual revenue [$M]\\n\\n$485,651 $482,130 $485,873 500,343\\n\\n50\\n\\n42.66\\n\\n45\\n\\n37.33\\n\\n40\\n\\n35\\n\\n30\\n\\n25\\n\\n20\\n\\n15\\n\\n10\\n\\n5\\n\\n0\\n\\nFY2017\\n\\nFY2018\\n\\nCarbon intensity [MT COe/$M]\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n22\\nProject GigatonTM\\nBeyond our direct operations, we aim to galvanize transformative action through Project Gigaton, a global effort that invites suppliers to join us in a commitment to avoid 1 billion metric tons of emissions in our collective value chains by 2030.\\nLaunched in 2017, Project Gigaton engages suppliers in setting targets and pursuing initiatives to avoid emissions in any of six areas where there are opportunities to do so: energy use, sustainable agriculture, waste, deforestation, packaging and product use.\\nWe worked with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) on the overall concept and design, as well as the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), Conservation International (CI), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the Sustainable Packaging Coalition (SPC) and CDP to connect suppliers to measurement methodologies, guidance and practical tools to help them reduce emissions. The program builds upon lessons learned from initiatives Walmart has undertaken with suppliers and NGOs in the past, such as our 20 million metric ton initiative.\\n\"Project Gigaton is the biggest and best example of a company encouraging its suppliers to be part of the solution to climate change. Through Walmart\\'s scale, collaboration and innovation, it continues to lead the way on actions that create both business and environmental value.\"\\n--FRED KRUPP | PRESIDENT, EDF\\n\\nWalmart established an external review process to support continual improvement of the methodologies to account for avoided emissions from Project Gigaton. A steering committee with subcommittees of technical experts from CDP, EDF, SPC, WWF and others lead the review process. To learn more about the platform, tools, resources and measurement methodology visit Project Gigaton on the Walmart Sustainability Hub.\\nWe are currently on track to achieve our gigaton goal. To date, more than 1,000 suppliers have formally signed on to the project. In 2018 alone, 382 suppliers reported avoiding 58,904,20617 MT of emissions, totaling 93,656,63918 MT toward the 1 gigaton target in the first two years of the program. We encourage suppliers to set specific, measurable, actionable, relevant and time-bound (\"SMART\") goals, because we believe they lead to substantially better results over time; to date, 47% of Project Gigaton suppliers have set such goals.\\nIn the coming year, we plan to focus on attracting additional suppliers and broadening the scope of initiatives across programmatic areas. While the program is on track, nearly 80% of reported avoided emissions were related to energy (under the Energy or Product Use action areas). Fewer have made commitments related to Deforestation or Sustainable Agriculture, where success requires influencing a disparate set of actors far upstream in the supply chain, addressing interdependencies and barriers in complex social and economic systems, and gaining alignment with others regarding methodologies for measurement and action. We are working with suppliers and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to support the development of tools to enable some improvement in these areas.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n23\\nProject Gigaton action areas\\nSuppliers can make commitments and pursue initiatives in one or more of six areas:\\n\\n1. Energy\\n\\nWe encourage suppliers to avoid energy-related emissions in two ways: first, reduce energy demand through optimization and efficiency; and second, to transition to energy sources that are renewable and emit little to no carbon. At the close of FY2019, our suppliers reported avoiding 25.2 million MT of emissions through work on energy.\\n\\nThe Walmart Factory\\n\\n25.2 MILLION\\nMT emissions avoided by Walmart suppliers through work on energy\\n\\nEnergy Efficiency Program (FEEP) is an example of how practical tools can facilitate emissions reductions in supply chains. Through FEEP,\\n\\nwe promote the\\n\\nuse of McKinsey & Company\\'s Resource Efficiency\\n\\nDeployment Engine (RedE), a web-based tool\\n\\ndesigned to help suppliers identify, prioritize and\\n\\nimplement energy efficiency projects. At the close\\n\\nof FY2019, more than 940 factories had joined the\\n\\nRedE system; active users report saving more than\\n\\n$29 million in annual operating expenses and avoiding\\n\\n199,854 MT of annual CO2e emissions.\\n\\n2. Waste\\n\\nFood, product and material waste in factories, warehouses, distribution centers and farms contributes to GHG emissions. Reducing and diverting waste from landfills can increase operating efficiency and lower costs. We encourage suppliers to reduce or eliminate waste from their operations, address postharvest losses on farms, standardize date labeling,\\n\\nextend product shelf life and educate customers about preventing food waste. Through philanthropy, we have also made investments to assess and reduce waste in food production and distribution. For example, the Walmart Foundation provided funding to the World Resources Institute to implement and accelerate adoption of its Food Loss and Waste Protocol, a publicly available approach to measure food waste and loss. See the Waste section of this report for more information on our efforts to reduce waste in our operations and product value chains.\\n3. Packaging\\nProject Gigaton invites suppliers to avoid emissions -- as well as drive down waste -- by reducing unnecessary packaging, optimizing packaging materials and increasing the reuse and recycling of packaging.\\nWalmart is taking specific aim at plastics, with expanded waste reduction commitments for our U.S. private brands -- commitments that are expected to impact an estimated 30,000 items for sale. Read more about our work to address plastic packaging in our value chain in the Waste section of this report.\\nOne example of progress: In FY2019, more than 800 Walmart private label suppliers signed up for the How2Recycle label (compared with only 100 in FY2018), and more than 16,000 Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) received the How2Recycle label.\\n4. Agriculture\\nBy pursuing and encouraging suppliers to adopt best practices in areas such as manure management, enteric emissions, feed inputs and other activities in animal agriculture, along with fertilizer optimization in crop production, we estimate there is a potential to impact 20% to 30% of our Project Gigaton GHG\\n\\nemissions goal by 2030 while reducing waste and improving yield.\\nWe have been working with many of our suppliers to support efforts to reduce emissions through fertilizer optimization. Collectively, suppliers have committed 36 million acres of land in these programs. Additionally, as part of our engagement with the Midwest Row Crop Collaborative, we supported the enrollment of over 140 demonstration farms in the Soil Health Partnership, an organization helping farmers use tools to identify, test and measure management practices for improving soil health.\\n5. Deforestation\\nWalmart invites suppliers to join us in working to reduce deforestation through innovative sourcing strategies and the use of technology to increase transparency and supply chain accountability. For example, some suppliers are participating in place-based, multi-stakeholder initiatives that are intended to reduce forest loss and degradation.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n24\\nProject Gigaton participant Unilever committed to supporting work in Sabah, Malaysia as part of its strategy to achieve a deforestationfree supply chain and avoid emissions. Unilever will help certify 60,000 hectares to the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) standards in Sabah as part of a program led by Forever Sabah, WWF Malaysia and the Palm Oil & NGO (PONGO) Alliance.\\nWe also support certifications to reduce forest loss and improve sustainability of commodities such as palm oil, pulp and paper, as well as Brazilian beef and soy. In 2015, based upon supplier reported data, 100% of our private-brand palm oil was sourced through a combination of RSPO certification criteria, including Mass Balance, Segregated, Identity Preserved and Credits. In 2017, we strengthened our efforts and set a more ambitious goal to source our private-brand palm oil in accordance with the principles and criteria of RSPO, using only Mass Balance or Segregated supply chain systems, or equivalent standards, by the end of 2020.\\n6. Product use & design\\nDesigners, manufacturers and brands have an opportunity to help customers lower the GHG emissions associated with their use of a product (and often saving customers money at the same time). In Project Gigaton, we ask suppliers to commit, in particular, to improving the in-use energy efficiency of their products.\\nWalmart has collaborated with suppliers on product innovations that have helped consumers reduce emissions -- such as working with suppliers to popularize LED lightbulbs. More recently, Project Gigaton participant Procter & Gamble announced\\n\\na commitment to cut 50 million metric tons of emissions from its operations and value chain by 2030. As part of that commitment, the Tide #QuickColdPledge encourages customers to switch to quick and cold laundry cycles.\\nFor more on how suppliers are demonstrating progress through Project Gigaton, visit our Supplier Recognition page.\\nClimate change adaptation\\nWith operations and a value chain that span the globe, we are incorporating resiliency planning and initiatives into parts of our business to help address the effects of climate change.\\nResilient sourcing\\nIn some cases where the availability or quality of commodities is susceptible to climate variables such as drought, storms and temperature, we are working with our buyers, distribution teams and suppliers on resiliency plans. For example, in our food business, we are working with produce suppliers on strategies such as using greenhouses to grow tomatoes and leafy greens, pioneering techniques to better manage growing conditions, improving yields and reducing the need for fertilizers.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n25\\nDisaster response & resiliency\\nThrough Walmart\\'s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and Walmart\\'s planning and operational practices, we identify, assess, triage and respond to natural disasters, including epidemiological issues, and security events that affect Walmart operations, associates and the communities we serve.\\nThe EOC operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to identify emerging risks, help facilities and associates prepare for disasters, monitor the development of crises, and serve as a triage point for emergencies in our stores or offices around the world. The EOC activates cross-functional subject matter teams throughout our business to prepare for and respond to disasters quickly and effectively.\\nThe EOC core team includes experts in emergency management who regularly train associates across the enterprise. We use data and predictive analytics to identify and assess weather and environmental risks. This data aids in disaster preparedness and helps maintain or quickly restore operations. In major disasters, we can deploy an array of internal resources, including mobile generators, fuel resources, trucks and associates who can help to manage our corporate response\\n\\nto the crises on the ground. Through the EOC\\'s efforts to coordinate with local, state and federal governmental agencies, as well as nonprofits and volunteer organizations around the world, Walmart is able to determine how it can help support local communities in the face of disaster.\\nPhilanthropy In the past two years, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation gave nearly $50 million in cash, water, food and other products to support victims of hurricanes, wildfires and tornadoes. Additionally, during the same time period, Walmart raised $44 million in donations from customers to support hurricane relief. We also fund the development of technologies that enhance situational awareness and enable coordination among first responders, such as RC View.\\nLearn more about our Disaster Relief program at Walmart.org.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n26\\nSustainable supply chain\\nQUICK FACTS\\nWalmart and Sam\\'s Club U.S. suppliers have improved their Sustainability Index scores by 28% compared with 201619\\nAs of the end of FY2019, we achieved a supplier Sustainability Index participation rate that covers 80% of the goods we sell in U.S. Walmart stores and Sam\\'s Club locations for categories where the Sustainability Index is available\\n\\nAccording to supplier reports, nearly 100% of Walmart U.S. stores\\' and clubs\\' seafood selection is sourced in accordance with our sustainable seafood policy\\n\\nPolicies & resources\\n\\nWalmart Sustainability Hub\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Sustainability Index\\n\\n\\n\\nCorporate policies\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Sustainability Index\\nOur aspirations for sustainable product supply chains go beyond managing risk in our own sourcing; we aim to bring about significant and lasting improvement across product supply chains through collaborative efforts with suppliers, NGOs and others.\\nWalmart encourages suppliers to report through the Sustainability Index, a science-based, thirdparty tool developed by The Sustainability Consortium in collaboration with universities, NGOs and suppliers. The Index includes data from suppliers on key environmental, social and other\\n\\nperformance indicators at the category level. The Index reflects responses from more than 1,500 unique suppliers covering 115 categories and departments across Walmart U.S. and Sam\\'s Club U.S.\\nWe set a goal in 2012 to buy 70% of our U.S. goods from suppliers that participate in the Index (in categories covered by the Index). We met that goal in 2017, and in 2018, more than 80% of such goods came from participating suppliers. Walmart and Sam\\'s Club U.S. suppliers have improved their Sustainability Index scores by 28% compared with 2016.20\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n27\\n20x25\\n20x25 means we aspire to source at least 20 key commodities more sustainably by 2025, across the following:\\n Fresh produce\\n Animal agriculture\\n Seafood\\n Specialty commodities such as coffee, tea and cocoa\\n Row crops\\n Consumables, such as personal care products\\n Apparel/textiles\\nWe have prioritized the 20x25 commodities based upon a variety of factors, including the nature and magnitude of environmental and social improvement opportunities (as informed by Sustainability Index data and feedback from stakeholders); business opportunity and risk (e.g., sales, supply security, cost issues or reputation risk); and Walmart\\'s ability to convene suppliers and others to promote change. In each case, we are working with suppliers, NGOs and others to understand the current state and pursue initiatives to advance environmental and/or social indicators.\\nThe Index is one of several tools we use to help us make progress on 20x25. As an example, the chart to the right illustrates the category scorecard for consumables suppliers. A Walmart buyer can use this scorecard to identify improvement opportunities for individual suppliers and spotlight issues for categorywide initiatives, such as sustainable chemistry and packaging design.\\n\\nIllustrative example of how we use the Sustainability Index: Consumables, health & wellness -- top 10 supplier category scorecard\\n\\nPRIORITY CHEMICALS\\n\\nPACKAGING\\n\\nDEFORESTATION INDEX\\n\\nDisclosure Chemicals management program Ingredient evaluations Sustainable design Raw material end of life How2Recycle Label (Y/N) Fiber sourcing certification Palm oil sourcing Participation\\n\\nSupplier A\\n\\nSupplier B\\n\\nSupplier C\\n\\nSupplier D\\n\\nSupplier E\\n\\nN/A\\n\\nSupplier F\\n\\nSupplier G\\n\\nN/A\\n\\nSupplier H\\n\\nSupplier I\\n\\nSupplier J\\n\\nY\\n\\nN\\n\\nY\\n\\nN/A\\n\\nN\\n\\nY\\n\\nN/A\\n\\nY\\n\\nY\\n\\nN/A\\n\\nN\\n\\nN/A\\n\\nY\\n\\nN\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n28\\nWe also pursue strategic initiatives for systemwide improvements in product value chains.

In 2005, Walmart set an aspirational goal to achieve zero waste in our own operations. By 2025, we aim to achieve that goal in Canada, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S.21 In 2018, we diverted 78% of our unsold products, packaging and other materials from landfill and incineration globally.22 We also work with our suppliers to reduce waste through Project Gigaton. Two areas of particular focus are plastic and food waste. In addition to addressing plastic and food waste in our operations, we are working with suppliers upstream and building capacity with consumers and other organizations to eliminate waste downstream.\\n\\nQUICK FACTS\\nIn the U.S., we diverted 81% of our unsold products, packaging and other waste materials from landfills and incineration\\nGlobally, we diverted more than 1.6 billion pounds of food waste from landfills23\\n\\nRecycled more than 430 million pounds of plastic film and rigid plastics globally\\nDonated more than 720 million pounds of food globally, which includes 640 million pounds in the U.S.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\nPolicies & resources\\n\\nWalmart Sustainability Hub: Waste\\n\\n\\n\\nWalmart Sustainability Hub: Packaging\\n\\n\\n\\nSustainable Packaging Playbook\\n\\n\\n\\n32\\nWALMART GLOBAL WASTE DESTINATION MIX\\nRecycling: 68%\\nDonation to people: 5%\\nAnimal feed: 3%\\nAnaerobic digestion: 1%\\nComposting: 1%\\nIncineration with and without energy recovery: 1%\\nLandfill: 21%\\n\\nPlastic waste\\nWhile plastic provides numerous benefits in areas such as food safety and packaging flexibility, society has been unable to collect and recycle plastic at the same rate as it is produced. According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, in 2016, less than 14% of plastic packaging was collected for recycling globally, with the rest ending up in landfills, rivers and oceans.\\nPlastic waste in our operations\\nWalmart\\'s aspiration is to achieve zero plastic waste. We are taking actions across our business to use less plastic, recycle more and support innovations to improve plastic waste reduction systems. For example, we aim to use reusable packing containers instead of disposable packaging whenever possible. When we do use disposable packaging, we try to recycle as much of it as possible. In 2018, we recycled 430 million pounds of plastic film and rigid plastics globally.\\nPlastic waste in our value chain\\nApproximately 40% of non-fiber plastic produced is used in packaging, the majority of which is used once and discarded. We have asked our suppliers to reduce\\n\\nunnecessary plastic packaging, increase packaging recyclability and increase recycled content, and to help us educate customers on reducing, reusing and recycling plastic.\\nAs of February 2019, we have committed to work with our U.S. private brand suppliers to:\\n Achieve 100% recyclable, reusable or industrially compostable packaging in all Walmart private-brand products by 2025\\n Target at least 20% post-consumer recycled content in private-brand packaging by 2025\\n Label 100% of food and consumable private-brand packaging with the How2Recycle label by 2022\\n Eliminate the nonrecyclable packaging material PVC in general merchandise packaging by 2020\\n Reduce private brand plastic packaging when possible\\nWe encourage our national brand suppliers to make similar packaging commitments through Project Gigaton; we engage them on sustainable packaging best practices to support the creation and achievement of such goals.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n33\\nTo encourage customers to recycle, we have asked suppliers to put more consumer-friendly recycling information on packaging. In the U.S., Walmart encourages use of the Sustainable Packaging Coalition\\'s How2Recycle label; in 2019 Walmart Canada announced a commitment to use this label on all private brand products by 2025.\\nBeyond packaging, we are also working to offer access to low-cost, high-quality alternatives for single-use plastic consumable products and plastic bags.\\nWe participate in the plastic working group at the Consumer Goods Forum and we support The UK Plastic Pact; we are also signatories to the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment.\\nTo learn more about our initiatives to eliminate waste, including our Sustainable Packaging Position Statement and Playbook, see the Walmart Sustainability Hub, Walmart Canada and Walmart Mexico.\\nPhilanthropy\\nTo help reduce plastic waste in the U.S., the Walmart Foundation has made targeted investments to support materials innovation, recycling collection and/or sortation infrastructure and consumer education. For example, the Walmart Foundation has supported the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation\\'s Beyond 34 project, an initiative aimed at increasing the U.S. recycling rate.\\nLearn more at Walmart.org.\\n\\nFood waste\\nWe are inspired by the U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 12.3 to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer level and reduce food losses along production and supply chains by 2030. Our end-to-end approach for addressing food waste includes pursuing best practices in our operations, building capacity in the broader food recovery system, working with suppliers upstream and empowering consumers downstream.\\nFood waste in our operations\\nWe aim for Zero Waste24 in our operations in Canada, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., which encompasses food waste. We are a signatory to the Consumer Goods Forum\\'s Food Waste Resolution and a member of the U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions, both of which seek to halve food waste. In FY2019, Walmart Canada committed to achieve zero food waste by 2025.\\nThe primary way we reduce food waste in our operations is by working to increase the sell-through rate. In the U.S., for example, we have strengthened our forecasting and ordering tools to improve inventory flow, adjusted store fixtures to increase turnover and customer appeal, made enhancements in our distribution centers, and provided our store associates with resources and education on how to better care for food and manage it at the end of shelf life. We are seeing results. In FY2019, we had 90 million fewer wasted units in our fresh departments in the U.S. as compared with last year.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n34\\nWe have also created a customized field-to-store network for highly perishable products, which is designed to reduce days in transit and increase freshness for customers. To support this network, we introduced specialized upstream nodes to consolidate\\n\\nproducts, which allow fresh produce to move faster through every step of the transportation process. While decreasing inventory and waste, our produce moves through our Speed Fresh Supply Chain up to 1.8 days faster.\\nAdditionally, in several markets, we adjust our product specifications to accept size and other cosmetic variations that don\\'t affect the quality of fresh produce. For example, our Asda stores in the U.K. sell cosmetically imperfect, or \"ugly,\" fruits and vegetables under a variety of labels. In FY2019, Asda sold more than a million boxes of this produce, avoiding 1.5 million pounds of waste.\\nIn Canada, China, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. we offer discounts on food that is close to its expiration date, including meat, bakery, dry goods and dairy. In FY2019, we sold more than 320 million units through these programs in the U.S., saving our customers money and helping prevent food waste.\\nWhen food goes unpurchased, Walmart works to maximize its use by getting it to people and places\\n\\nthat need it. In addition to donating food to food banks and other charities, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation have donated funds to purchase equipment to increase the capacity of the charitable\\n\\n1.6 BILLION\\npounds of food waste diverted from landfills globally25\\n\\nmeal system to transport\\n\\nand deliver fresh food. In FY2019, we donated\\n\\n640 million pounds of food in the U.S. alone.\\n\\nIf food is no longer edible, we try to convert it to animal feed, compost or energy. Our Asda stores, for example, are recycling food into energy by taking inedible unsold food to anaerobic digestion plants, where it is broken down into gases that can be used as fuel and fertilizers.\\n\\nIn 2018, we diverted more than 1.6 billion pounds of food waste from landfills globally. We also received a B, the highest score among U.S. supermarkets assessed, in the Center for Biological Diversity\\'s\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n35\\nstudy on food waste. The study reviewed American supermarkets\\' food waste reduction commitments, policies and actions.\\nFood waste in our value chain\\nWe undertake efforts to help eliminate food waste in our value chains beyond our own operations. As noted above in the discussion of fresh supply chain improvements, our efforts include reducing days in the supply chain from point of origin to store.\\nAs well, through Project Gigaton, Walmart is encouraging our suppliers to measure and report food waste; introduce reprocessing, donation and recycling practices; and standardize date labeling (when the date is required for quality reasons only) to eliminate customer confusion. In FY2018, 92% of our private-brand products in the U.S. used \"Best If Used By\" date labels unless a food safety or regulatory reason prevented us from doing so. Beyond our private-brand suppliers, we also advocate for other suppliers to standardize date labels across their brands in line with the Consumer Goods Forum\\'s Date Labeling Call to Action.\\nFor more information on our work to reduce food waste, please visit our Global responsibility website.\\n\\nPhilanthropy\\nThe Walmart Foundation\\'s philanthropic investments help drive system-wide change by investing in prevention efforts to stop food waste and loss from occurring, and the recovery and redistribution of edible food that would otherwise go to waste, specifically from farms and retail settings. The Walmart Foundation made a commitment to award $15 million to organizations that help reduce food waste and strengthen food banks in Canada from FY2017 through FY2020; more than $11 million has been allocated so far.

Examples include:\\n We Are Still In: To promote the aims of the Paris Climate Agreement after the announcement of the U.S. withdrawal, Walmart joined an initiative called We Are Still In. This is a signal to world leaders that Americans will not retreat from the global pact to reduce emissions and stem the causes of climate change.\\n Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance: We are members of this coalition that brings together purchasers and suppliers of renewable energy to make the process of transitioning to cleaner energy sources easier.\\n Paris and Bonn negotiations: We participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conferences in 2015 and 2017 to collaborate with international stakeholders in advancing environmental issues around the world.\\n\\n Global Forest Watch Pro: To promote transparency and traceability across our supply chains, in 2017, Walmart joined the World Resources Institute and 20 other companies to launch Global Forest Watch Pro, an online platform that provides companies, banks and other stakeholders with data and tools for monitoring global forest loss because of the production of key commodities such as palm oil, soy and Brazilian beef.\\n Consumer Goods Forum: We are a member and our CEO serves on its Board of Directors.

He talked about wanting to \"take care of our associates\" and support the vision customers hold for their communities. While Sam used his own words, a respect for human rights corresponds with the core values he instilled in our company.\\nHuman rights statement\\nFor many years, our perspectives and initiatives that underscore our respect for human rights were described across a number of statements (e.g., Supplier Code of Conduct) and documents (e.g., Ethics and Compliance Report). In November 2018, we published Walmart\\'s first Human Rights Statement, which consolidates our perspectives in one place.\\n\\nAs part of our work to develop our Human Rights Statement, we convened a cross-functional Steering Committee as well as a Working Group who:\\n Reviewed a variety of international instruments including, but not limited to, the United Nations (U.N.) Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization\\'s 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights\\n Reviewed stakeholder feedback from research and consultations\\n Obtained and incorporated feedback from human rights subject matter experts\\n Considered analysis of Walmart conducted by a number of third parties, including Shift, Corporate Human Rights Benchmark, Know the Chain and Oxfam\\n Reviewed the work of other companies, both those in our peer industry group and those that are considered leaders in human rights, to understand and compare their approach to ours\\n\\nWalmart\\'s four core values Service to the customer Respect for the individual\\n\\nStrive for excellence Act with integrity\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n41\\nOur Human Rights Statement confirms our respect for human rights and articulates how our four values inform our approach to human rights throughout our corporate activities, with a focus on our associates, customers, supply chain and the communities in which we operate.\\nThe statement was approved by the company\\'s Board of Directors in 2018. We have shared it with associates via team meetings, presentations, social media and other outreach. After publication of this report, we expect to expand our communication efforts with our associates and suppliers.\\nHuman rights: governance and implementation\\nIn 2018, we launched a cross-functional Human Rights Steering Committee, comprised of Walmart leaders from Global Responsibility; Human Resources; Labor Relations; Responsible Sourcing; Culture, Diversity & Inclusion; Government Affairs; Communications; and Legal. This group oversees and guides our human rights approach at an enterprise level, which includes identifying our priority issues across the enterprise. In addition, this group provides a cross-functional perspective on the company\\'s approach to ongoing implementation of our Human Rights Statement, such as through policies and procedures, and offers guidance and counsel to relevant stakeholders as part of that process.\\nThe Steering Committee is supported by a Human Rights Working Group, which meets regularly and consists of members from each department as noted above. Last year, the Steering Committee and Working Group focused on:\\n\\n Developing our Human Rights Statement  Mapping the various policies and procedures\\nwe have in place to help mitigate potential human rights issues\\n Consulting a variety of human rights subject matter experts for their insights\\n Identifying our salient human rights issues\\nWe have identified several steps to continue advancing our work on human rights at Walmart, including:\\n Assess potential adverse human rights impacts and the relevant processes in place\\n Integrate relevant findings into policies and procedures\\n Track progress as part of Walmart\\'s efforts to continuously improve\\n Communicate with relevant internal and external stakeholders for insight on our progress and priorities\\n Adjust our human rights priorities as needed\\nExternal stakeholders\\nWe value and routinely engage external stakeholders for their perspectives on human rights.\\nFor example, as we developed our Human Rights Statement, we spoke with subject matter experts from BSR, Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, Institute for Human Rights and Business, New York University Stern Center for Business & Human Rights and Shift. We also engaged others through dialogue (e.g., Issara Institute and International Justice Mission through efforts combating forced labor) and forums (e.g., U.N.

Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, as well as pertinent industry business disclosures. We then considered:\\n Relevance to our company purpose  Key categories and markets  The potential scale of the human rights issue\\n Walmart\\'s ability to make a difference\\n\\nBased upon our analysis, we have prioritized four salient human rights issues associated with our activities, each of which encompasses several aspects.

In some cases, we open a formal investigation, using internal investigators or a third party, depending on the nature of the allegation. We work to see that concerns are appropriately addressed in a timely manner.\\nWe also monitor the number and types of inquiries and allegations received through these and other channels. This information helps us to understand where we may need to strengthen policies or procedures.\\nWe encourage stakeholders to raise concerns and to report activities they suspect may contravene the values and positions we express in our policies and statements. We will not retaliate against any party for raising concerns in good faith.\\nFor additional information about the mechanisms we have in place to hear concerns, please visit the following sections of this report:\\n Associate voice\\n Sourcing responsibly\\n Ethics & compliance\\n\\nWe are also mindful that human rights abuses can be the result of systemic issues, increasing the complexity of issue resolution. As an example, in 2013, Walmart was a founding member of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which provided extensive fire safety training; gave access to a 24hour, confidential helpline to report safety and other job-related concerns; and supported extensive remediation of factory safety issues. According to the Alliance\\'s fifth annual report, 90% of high-priority remediation items were complete across all factories affiliated with the Alliance and nearly 1.6 million workers have been trained in fire safety. More than 1.5 million workers now have access to the 24-hour confidential helpline. While the Alliance\\'s commitment ended in 2018, Walmart remains dedicated to worker safety in Bangladesh.\\nWalmart\\'s next steps\\nIn this next year, we expect to:\\n Continue to broadly communicate our Human Rights Statement with our associates and suppliers as well as customers and the communities in which we operate so that they may be familiar with the concepts and values within it.\\n Continue to engage human rights thought leaders and stakeholders to help us advance our initiatives and improve our effectiveness.\\n Continue to develop our reporting, as we learn more about what our associates and stakeholders would like to know.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n44\\nRetail opportunity\\n\\nOne of society\\'s greatest challenges is helping workers gain the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the jobs of today and prepare for the jobs of tomorrow.\\nToday, millions of jobs are left unfilled as employers struggle to find workers with the skills needed to fill open positions. In the coming decades, growth in automation will likely exacerbate the skill development challenge as technology drives rapid change in the types of jobs available for workers and the capabilities they need to fulfill those roles.\\nThe retail sector -- as a foundational entry point to work, a place to gain valuable skills and a significant portion of the overall job market -- provides a gateway to upward mobility for millions of people and can help address the global need for workforce development. Recognizing this, Walmart is committed to helping make retail a place of opportunity: a launching pad for people to acquire the skills and experience needed to advance in the workforce.\\n\\nQUICK FACTS\\nAccess to employment\\nApproximately 2.2 million associates in thousands of communities around the world\\nStability\\nThe average wage of a full-time, hourly field associate in our Walmart U.S. stores as of March 2019 is $14.2630\\nAverage total compensation and benefits for a full-time, hourly field associate in our Walmart U.S. stores is $19.31 per hour, including wages, bonuses and benefits31\\n$793 million in bonuses delivered to fulland part-time hourly associates in our Walmart U.S. stores\\n\\nThe majority of the hourly associates in our Walmart U.S. stores are full-time\\nWe\\'ve reduced our Walmart U.S. store associate turnover by 10% or 1000 bps, the lowest level in five years\\nWe have more than 35,000 people working in our U.S. stores in roles that didn\\'t exist two years ago\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n45\\nPolicies & resources\\n\\nHuman Rights Statement\\n\\n\\n\\nStatement of Ethics\\n\\n\\n\\nMobility\\nOpened nearly 200 Walmart Academies in the U.S.\\nMore than 800,000 employees trained in Walmart Academies as of March 2019 since program\\'s inception\\nMore than 850,000 U.S. employees trained in Walmart Pathways since program\\'s inception\\nPromoted more than 215,000 people to jobs of greater responsibility and higher pay in Walmart U.S. stores in Fiscal Year 2019\\nMore than 75% of our Walmart U.S. store operation management team members started as hourly employees\\nWalmart store managers earn an average of $175,000/year in the U.S.\\n\\nDiversity & inclusion32\\n55% of total U.S. workforce is female\\n43% of U.S. management is female\\n26% of Information Technology and Engineering workforce is female\\n44% of associates with revenueproducing responsibility are women33\\n44% of total U.S. workforce are people of color\\n33% of U.S. management are people of color\\n34% of associates with revenue producing-responsibility are people of color34\\n16% of associates with revenueproducing responsibility are women of color35\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n46\\nRetail opportunity at Walmart\\nWalmart offers a wide variety of career opportunities, low barriers to entry, competitive wages and benefits, and paths to advancement through onthe-job coaching, training and education. By helping associates acquire the skills they need to advance, we aim to offer a distinctive employee value proposition among retailers.\\nOur workforce philosophy is formed around three foundational pillars -- access to employment, stability and mobility -- designed to lead people from entry to opportunity while forging a model for addressing global workforce development challenges. We\\'re seeing the results of this approach in the U.S.:\\n Turnover in our Walmart U.S. stores is down more than 10% or 1000 bps -- the lowest level in five years\\n Nearly three out of four associates would refer friends or family to Walmart for employment\\n As of year-end FY2019, we promoted more than 215,000 associates to jobs with more responsibility and higher pay in Walmart U.S. stores\\n As of FY2019, more than 75% of our store operations management team members began as hourly associates\\n On average, a Walmart store manager makes $175,000 per year\\nAccess to employment\\nEntry-level jobs provide economic opportunity and a pathway to upward mobility for many people. Such pathways are especially critical at a time when, according to the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce, job opportunities for lower-skilled workers across the U.S. economy have decreased.\\n\\nWalmart provides jobs for over\\n\\nONE\\n\\n1 million people\\n\\nMILLION+ in\\n\\nthe U.S. (and over\\n\\nU.S. jobs provided\\n\\n2 million worldwide).\\n\\nFor many of our\\n\\nentry-level hourly positions, we do not require\\n\\ndegrees and we have \"banned the box\" to lower\\n\\nbarriers to entering the workforce. And we provide\\n\\nopportunities for associates to learn important\\n\\nand transferable job skills, advance their education,\\n\\nand even gain college credit -- all while earning\\n\\na paycheck.\\n\\nStability\\nIn addition to providing an entry to employment, we strive to help associates maintain job stability so they are encouraged to stay with Walmart and are positioned to grow their skills and knowledge on the job. For example, in the U.S., we aim to do this by providing competitive pay and benefits, enhancing scheduling, and improving job design, leveraging technology to make jobs more rewarding. In a U.S. associate survey from FY2019, 74% shared that they feel they were able to plan or request their schedule far enough in advance to balance their work and personal life. Specific stability initiatives in the U.S. include the following:\\nPay\\n We have raised our starting wages in the U.S. by more than 50% over the past three years.\\n 100% of our U.S. associates earn above the federal minimum wage (which is currently $7.25/hour); newly hired associates start at $11 per hour or more, while key department manager roles can earn as much as $24.70 per hour.\\n\\n The average wage of a full-time, hourly field associate in our Walmart U.S. stores as of March 2019, is $14.26 per hour.36\\n Average total compensation and benefits for a full-time, hourly field associate in our Walmart U.S. stores is $19.31 per hour, including wages, bonuses, and benefits such as paid time off.37\\n In FY2019, $793 million in bonuses were delivered to full- and part-time hourly associates in our Walmart U.S. stores.\\n Financial planning tools: Using the Even app, our associates can access tools to help them plan for bills and savings goals, eliminating the work of figuring out how much money is okay to spend. When unexpected expenses occur, our associates can access earned wages ahead of scheduled paychecks using an \"Instapay\" feature. The tools are available to all hourly and salaried Walmart, Sam\\'s Club and Walmart U.S. eCommerce associates. As of February 2019, 600,000 associates used the Even app.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n47\\nBenefits\\n Healthcare: Walmart offers health benefits starting at around $26 per pay period for all full- and part-time associates who have worked an average of 30 hours per week over the past 12 months. This is about 40% less than the national average cost for singleperson coverage.\\n 401(k): We offer 401(k) contributions and provide full- and part-time hourly U.S. associates a match of up to 6% after one year on the job. Associates are eligible to contribute to their 401(k) on their first day of work.\\n Paid time off (PTO): Walmart\\'s U.S. PTO policy streamlines paid vacation, sick time, personal time and holiday time into one category. In February 2019, we introduced protected PTO, where not required by paid sick leave laws, allowing our associates to earn up to 48 hours of paid time that can be used anytime to cover scheduled shifts when they are unexpectedly not able to make it to work.\\n Expanded parental leave, covering U.S. salaried and fulltime hourly associates: Walmart provides associates with parental leave, as well as assistance with adoption expenses.\\n-- The parental benefit supports associates who become parents through birth, adoption or fostercare placement with up to six weeks of protected paid time away from work.\\n-- Birth moms can receive 16 weeks of total paid time away when maternity and parental are combined (10 weeks of maternity and six weeks of parental leave).\\n-- These changes create parity for maternity and parental leave benefits among salaried and fulltime hourly associates.\\n\\nScheduling\\n More than 50% of hourly associates in our Walmart U.S. stores are full-time.\\n Predictable scheduling: We recently improved schedule predictability with a new system based on a method called core hours. Associates with core-hour schedules normally work the same weekly shifts for at least 13 weeks, enabling them to plan and prioritize important responsibilities outside of work.\\n Flexible scheduling: In November 2018, we rolled out My Walmart Schedule, a system that allows associates to view schedules, swap shifts with other associates and pick up unfilled shifts.\\nEvolving job design\\nMeeting customer demand for new and better experiences requires changes to jobs, new associate skills, and redesign of store processes and systems.\\nEven as technology enables efficiencies in some areas, we\\'re creating new opportunities and training associates to lead in others. We have more than 35,000 people working in our U.S. stores in roles that didn\\'t exist two years ago. Some of those roles include personal shoppers for Online Grocery Pickup, self-checkout hosts and customer hosts. We\\'re also providing associates with tools that help them do their jobs such as AI-powered FAST Unloaders that make unloading trucks more efficient, which can enable associates who previously spent large portions of their shifts unloading trucks to learn new skills such as customer service and merchandising.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n48\\nMobility\\n\\nAccording to a Pew Research Center survey\\n\\nconducted in association with the Markle\\n\\nFoundation, a majority of U.S. workers say that\\n\\nnew skills and training are essential to career\\n\\nsuccess. Walmart aims to help workers gain the\\n\\nskills they need to succeed within our company and\\n\\nbeyond. For example, in Walmart U.S., we provide\\n\\non-the-job training and access to affordable,\\n\\nrelevant education programs including high school\\n\\ncompletion, college preparation and subsidized\\n\\nfour-year college degrees (with a head start for\\n\\nthose who receive college credit for Walmart\\n\\nexperience).

We promoted more than\\n\\n215,000 people to jobs of greater responsibility\\n\\nand higher pay in Walmart U.S. More than 75% of\\n\\nour Walmart U.S. store operations management\\n\\nteam members started as hourly employees,\\n\\nand Walmart store managers earn an average of\\n\\n$175,000/year in the U.S.\\n\\nTraining programs\\nWalmart U.S. offers all associates the opportunity to gain critical skills for job advancement, including language training and professional development. We also offer two structured training programs for associates at Walmart U.S. stores: Pathways and The Walmart Academy.\\n\\nBuilding foundational skills through Pathways\\nOur Pathways training program helps associates gain vital retail job skills, including customer service, merchandising, teamwork and communications. The program leverages self-paced, computer-based learning and mentoring from supervisors who provide feedback on associates\\' job performance and highlight potential career opportunities. More than 850,000 associates have completed the Pathways program since its inception.\\nBuilding advanced skills through Walmart Academy\\nWalmart Academy offers hands-on, immersive learning, combining technology, classroom training and ongoing coaching on the sales floor. Using cutting-edge handheld devices and virtual reality, the program prepares associates for jobs as frontline hourly supervisors, department managers and assistant managers. Associates are paid for the time spent in training.\\nIn the last three years, Walmart has opened nearly 200 Academies in the U.S., most within an hour\\'s drive of a Walmart store, and each Academy serves approximately 25 nearby stores. In FY2019 alone, we trained about 450,000 associates through Walmart Academy.\\nEducation opportunities\\nWalmart offers education benefits for General Educational Development (GED) certification, high school completion and college credit through an innovative approach to higher education that focuses on meeting the distinct needs of the adult working learner.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n49\\nIn June 2018, Walmart teamed up with Guild Education to offer associates the opportunity to earn their high school diploma at no cost to them and a college degree for $1 per day. That means Walmart will subsidize the cost of higher education, beyond financial aid and an associate contribution equivalent to $1 per day. Available to all U.S. Walmart and Sam\\'s Club associates, the program offers access to both associate\\'s and bachelor\\'s degrees from three university partners, chosen based on their success with adult working learners. Associates can earn their associate\\'s degree in an area of their choice and a bachelor\\'s degree in business management and supply chain management. Associates have access to a counselor to help them navigate the application process and stick with the program. More than 1,500 students began classes in Fall 2018 across three university partners.\\nEmployees have taken notice of these opportunities, according to associate engagement surveys that Walmart conducts at least annually. In our most recent FY2019 U.S. associate engagement results, 81% of associates agreed with the statement, \"I have the training necessary to perform my job well.\" This reflects our increased investment in employee training. We are seeing additional benefits from our investments, as shown by the fact that the majority of our associates also agreed with the statement, \"I see a clear path for my career growth at Walmart.\" Finally, the survey also confirms that nearly 75% of our associates would refer friends or family to Walmart for employment.\\n\\nAssociate voice\\nAt Walmart, we aim to create a collaborative environment where associates are free to respectfully express their opinions and feel that their concerns are heard. We want associates to share their ideas for making our business better and relay, in confidence when appropriate, any workplace concerns. To that end, we gather and respond to associates\\' feedback in a variety of ways, including, for example, in the U.S.:\\n Personal, one-on-one interactions\\n Team meetings\\n Cascaded leadership communications\\n Company intranet\\n Facebook Workplace and other social media channels\\n Traditional digital communications, such as email\\nSenior operations executives also conduct formal listening tours twice a year with associates across the U.S. Additional annual company gatherings include the Year Beginning Meeting, Holiday Meeting and Shareholders\\' Associate Week. Our U.S. CEO also holds quarterly town hall meetings with associates and weekly operations feedback calls with store managers. During these sessions, any action items are assigned to field and home office associates, including officers, who are responsible for addressing each one.\\nThese engagement efforts have led to meaningful improvements in company policies. Through various lines of communication, our U.S. associates asked\\n\\nWalmart to consider changes such as expanding our parental leave, bonuses for work attendance and a PTObased time-off system so they would not incur penalties for sick leave. Walmart U.S. responded by implementing these practices.\\nWalmart\\'s Open Door process is another resource that allows any associate -- from entry level to the C-suite -- to share ideas and raise an issue in good faith at any time without fear of reprisal.\\nAdditional information on our Open Door policy, including our stance against retaliation for concerns raised in good faith, as well as guidance for our associates on when and how to use these resources, can be found in our Statement of Ethics.\\nConfidential resources\\nIn addition to the communication avenues described above, employees have access to a variety of confidential resources.\\nTo ask a question or report an ethics violation, employees can contact Walmart Global Ethics at www.WalmartEthics.com, via email at ethics@walmart.com or 1-800-WM-ETHIC in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada. Our Statement of Ethics outlines resources available globally. Walmart strictly forbids retaliation against any associate who reports a concern in good faith. Reports can be made anonymously and will be treated as confidential.\\nLearn more about how we communicate with associates in the Stakeholder engagement section.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n50\\nFreedom of association\\nOne of our enduring core values since Sam Walton founded the company is Respect for the Individual.\\nOur associate freedom of association position\\nConsistent with applicable law and practice, Walmart respects the rights of associates to join, form or not to join an employee association or trade union of their choice without interference. Associates should exercise these rights in an informed manner, and with the benefit of thoughtful consideration and available information. In the exercise of these rights, we believe in the free exchange of ideas, opinions and information, provided there is no interference.\\nThese rights are defined under applicable national law and practice in the countries in which Walmart operates and from which Walmart sources the products we sell.\\n\\nGlobally, Walmart has associates who are represented by some form of collective bargaining in more than half of the 27 markets where we operate. The U.S. model is employee choice.\\nFostering inclusion\\nOur people and culture help make Walmart successful. We are committed to building a diverse workforce that represents the more than approximately 275 million customers who choose to shop with us instore or online every week. A variety of perspectives enriches our culture, leads to innovative solutions for our business and enables us to better meet the needs of a diverse customer base. We aim to develop inclusive leaders and an inclusive culture, while also growing the pipeline of women and people of color at every level.

We seek to develop equity in representation and an inclusive culture and to confirm our commitment to fair-pay practices. An important component of fostering inclusion is raising awareness about unconscious bias. We have developed unconscious bias training for associates across the organization. All officers have Inclusive Leadership Expectations as part of their annual performance evaluation. A component of these expectations is abiding by our Statement of Ethics, failure of which may result in an annual cash incentive pay reduction. For more information, please see our Culture Diversity & Inclusion (CDI) Report.\\n52\\nMeasuring progress\\nUsing engagement survey feedback, metrics on representation and inclusion indices, we\\'re measuring our progress and informing future priorities. Introduced in 2016, our CDI scorecard has proven to be a valuable tool, providing a biannual, actionable report that is reviewed by senior management.\\nFair pay\\nFairness in pay is an important issue for our company. We are committed to creating a performance culture where associates are rewarded based on meaningful factors such as qualifications, experience, performance and the type of work they do.\\nOur compensation plans and practices are designed to comply with applicable laws that require companies to pay their employees fairly and equitably. In the U.S., for example, relevant laws include Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Equal Pay Act, both of which require that men and women be given equal pay for equal work. Salary and wage ranges for our associates are based on objective factors, regardless of gender or race. We continually review our processes to make sure we are living up to our commitment to fair-pay practices.\\nRead more about Diversity & Inclusion programs and data.\\n\\neffort to accelerate retail and related sector employee advancement.\\nThrough the end of FY2019, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation had invested more than $100 million in organizations working to accelerate retail and related sector employee advancement.

In 1992, we launched our Responsible Sourcing program to establish our expectation that suppliers and their facilities operate responsibly, in a way that protects worker dignity. We set expectations through our Standards for Suppliers and use a riskbased approach to monitoring our supply chain, focusing audits on those geographies with greater potential risks.\\nWe also collaborate with peers and other industry stakeholders to address human rights issues in complex supply chains and to improve the capacity of the global retail sourcing system. Recognizing the need for whole-system transformation, Walmart has committed to use our ability to bring together stakeholders including industries, civil society, governments and international organizations to address the major potential risks to the dignity of workers in a minimum of 10 retail supply chains by 2025.\\n\\nQUICK FACTS\\nWalmart uses a risk-based approach to supply chain monitoring and focuses audits on geographies with greater potential risks\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\nSuppliers have disclosed more than 25,800 facilities in \"active\" status to Walmart in FY2019\\n\\nPolicies & resources\\n\\nResponsible Sourcing\\n\\n\\n\\nGlobal Ethics & Compliance\\n\\n\\n\\nStandards for Suppliers\\n\\n\\n\\nResponsible Sourcing Academy\\n\\n\\n\\nAudit and Assessment Policy and Guidance \\n\\nSupplier Disclosure Policy and Guidance\\n\\n\\n\\n54\\nSourcing responsibly\\nGiven our size and global footprint, Walmart has a unique opportunity to use the power of our purchase orders to improve supply chain conditions. We set high expectations for our suppliers. Members of our Responsible Sourcing team around the world work to assess risk, monitor supply chain conditions\\n\\nthrough audit assessments and investigations, provide training and tools for suppliers, and collaborate with stakeholders to make progress on key industry-wide issues. The team also acts as a resource for fellow Walmart associates, providing training so that they can better understand and navigate potential human rights risks associated with various geographies\\n\\nand industries. Having our Responsible Sourcing associates embedded in markets around the world allows us to better understand regional challenges in our supply chains and leverage our local presence to build strong connections with local suppliers and markets. As of January 2019, we have more than 150 Responsible Sourcing associates.\\n\\nResponsible Sourcing associates are embedded in markets and hubs around the world to better support our global supply chain\\nAs of January 31, 2019, our associates were located in the following countries:\\n\\nAR Argentina\\n\\nID Indonesia\\n\\nBD Bangladesh JP Japan\\n\\nCM Cambodia\\n\\nMX Mexico\\n\\nCA Canada\\n\\nPK Pakistan\\n\\nCL Chile\\n\\nTH Thailand\\n\\nCN China\\n\\nUK United Kingdom\\n\\nCA\\n\\nUK\\n\\nCR Costa Rica\\n\\nUS United States\\n\\nGT Guatemala\\n\\nVT Vietnam\\n\\nUS\\n\\nIN India\\n\\nZA South Africa\\n\\nMX GT CR\\n\\nZA AR\\nCL\\n\\nJP\\n\\nCN PK\\nBD\\n\\nIN\\n\\nTH\\n\\nCM VT\\n\\nID\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n55\\nStandards for suppliers\\nWe communicate our fundamental expectations to suppliers on social conditions, worker safety and integrity in the workplace through our Standards for Suppliers. Suppliers must agree to the Standards as part of their Supplier Agreement with Walmart. The Standards apply to anyone that supplies product to Walmart for resale, as well as any agents they use. Among other obligations, the Standards require our suppliers, and those who supply to them, to:\\n Comply with the law\\n Be transparent in their production for Walmart\\n Not use involuntary or underage labor\\n Maintain a fair process for making employment decisions\\n Comply with all applicable laws and agreements regarding compensation and working hours\\n Respect the principles of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining\\n Provide a safe work environment\\n\\nWe provide tools and resources for suppliers through the Responsible Sourcing Academy, which includes training, best practices, and educational materials developed by third parties and Walmart. More than 4,300 supplier representatives have registered in the Responsible Sourcing Academy.\\nMonitoring\\nThrough our risk-based monitoring program, we use third-party audits to evaluate supply chain practices against our Standards. After assessing the standards, protocols, governance and integrity of each program, the Responsible Sourcing team approved nine thirdparty audit programs. In addition, we work with the audit programs to make enhancements and share best practices for the benefit of the broader supply chain. To determine where regular audits will be required, we assign countries a classification of their potential social compliance risk level based on the World Bank governance indicators. Facilities in countries that fall into the highest level of risk -- which are identified as Category 2 and Category 3 countries -- are subject to\\n\\nregular audits. Facilities in Category 1 countries, such as the U.S., are subject to audits on a sample basis.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n56\\nRisk-based social compliance audit assessments\\nWe take a risk-based approach to auditing, which allocates more resources to facilities located in countries with greater potential risks; facilities in higher-risk countries are required to submit regular audits, while facilities in lower-risk countries are audited on a sample basis. Facilities submit an approved third-party audit to Walmart, which we assess against our standards. In FY2019, we assessed more than 14,700 audits.\\n\\n2.1% 0.3%\\n23.7%\\n\\n10.8%\\n\\nFacilities for which we found general compliance.\\nFacilities that audits show to be generally compliant with our Standards but have failed to meet at least one important requirement. In these cases, we ask the facility to remediate noncompliances found in the audit report.\\nFacilities where we have found more significant violations. We will continue to source from facilities with orange ratings as they work to remediate the violations.\\nFacilities where serious infractions were found that may result in temporarily or permanently terminating the facility as a supplier to Walmart\\n\\n63.1%\\n\\nFacilities participating in our small supplier program and therefore did not receive a color rating.\\n\\nWalmart reviews each facility audit and assigns a color rating based on the third-party program\\'s ability to produce product for Walmart evaluation and Walmart\\'s own assessment of that evaluation. Green ratings represent facilities for which we found general compliance. Yellow ratings identify facilities that audits show to be generally compliant with our Standards but have failed to meet at least one important requirement. In these cases, we ask the facility to remediate noncompliances found in the audit report. Orange ratings identify facilities whose audits indicate more serious violations of the Standards, but from which Walmart will continue to allow sourcing while the violations are remediated. Red ratings identify facilities for which Responsible Sourcing has discovered violations of a nature that may make it appropriate to temporarily or\\n\\npermanently terminate the facility\\'s ability to produce product for Walmart.\\nWalmart reviews and assesses each audit report. Of the more than 14,700 thirdparty audit reports Walmart reviewed and assessed in FY2019, 23.7% received green, 63.1% received yellow, 10.8% received orange and 0.3% received red. An additional 2.1% of audits were for facilities participating in our small supplier program and, therefore, did not receive a color rating.\\nIn addition, Walmart operates several grievance mechanisms to solicit the concerns of workers in the supply chain. These include:\\n Global helpline: Walmart provides global and local phone numbers that anyone can use to ask questions and report concerns related to Walmart\\'s business, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\\n\\nThe helpline is equipped to handle most local languages spoken in each of the retail markets where we operate.\\n Global email address: This email address is available for reporting concerns, asking questions, or simply seeking guidance for situations that may be unclear. All contacts are received by Walmart\\'s Global Ethics and Compliance team in Bentonville, Arkansas.\\n WalmartEthics.com: This website is available in 13 languages and accessible globally. It provides a platform where stakeholders can ask questions, read our Statement of Ethics, submit ethical concerns and follow up on previously reported concerns.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n57\\nCases resulting from these grievance mechanisms, as well as from audits and internal referrals, can be referred to our Responsible Sourcing Investigations or other compliance teams within Walmart. In FY2019, our Responsible Sourcing team opened more than 600 cases involving allegations of supply chain misconduct. Each case is reviewed and may include worker interviews, on-site visits and follow up with audit programs. Responsible Sourcing may also engage with the supplier directly, which typically includes a discussion regarding the allegations; a clarification of expectations; and the review, approval and follow up with the supplier on a corrective action plan. In FY2019, Walmart used this issue response process for more than 65 cases. Reports of misconduct ranged from issues such as lack of required posters to more serious violations that warranted in-depth scrutiny.\\nWe believe that staying engaged with suppliers through dialogue and corrective plans can have a more positive impact than simply abandoning the supplier relationship -- and in FY2019, more than 480 facilities remediated from orange to either yellow or green assessments. However, substantiated findings may result in consequences for suppliers, facilities or both -- up to and including termination of business with Walmart and its subsidiaries. Since 2012, we have stopped doing business with more than 30 suppliers in response to serious violations of our Standards.\\nLearn more about Supplier Standards at our Responsible Sourcing website.\\nStrengthening capacity of global audit systems\\nMany of the challenges we seek to address in our global supply chains are not unique to Walmart,\\n\\nand we are collaborating with our peers and key stakeholders to strengthen and standardize expectations for suppliers to drive transformation across supply chains. For instance, to help improve capacity of supply chain audits, Walmart and other stakeholders -- including third-party audit firms and other companies who rely on social compliance audits, audit programs and non-governmental organizations (NGO) -- established the Association of Professional Social Compliance Auditors (APSCA). The APSCA aims to increase the credibility and professionalism of auditors and audit programs across the industry. In 2018, the APSCA developed a Code of Professional Conduct and a Competency Framework for Auditors, and the group began piloting its certification process. As of January 31, 2019, more than 3,200 auditors have registered with the APSCA.\\nCollaborative efforts to address systemic issues\\nFor certain risks, supply chain monitoring and supplier engagement can only go so far. Long-term social sustainability in complex, global supply chains requires whole-system transformation and collective action of suppliers, NGOs, governments, retailers and others. Walmart has committed to work with others to address potential risks to the dignity of workers in a minimum of 10 retail supply chains by 2025; so far, we have focused on five supply chain initiatives:\\n Apparel in Bangladesh\\n Produce in the U.S. and Mexico\\n Shrimp in Thailand\\n Tuna processed in Thailand\\n Electronics sourced for the U.S. retail market supply chain\\n\\nTo help prioritize key geographies and supply chains, we analyzed internal data, audit findings and other external resources such as the World Bank global indices and government and media reports. We also considered where Walmart could have the biggest impact and identified collaborators that could help effect change.\\nIn such whole-system, collaborative efforts, Walmart engages through business and philanthropic initiatives that include:\\n Clarifying expectations with suppliers\\n Investing in research to understand prevalence of human rights violations and track progress toward improvement\\n Engaging with governments to advocate for laws, regulations and enforcement\\n Collaborating with key stakeholders and thought leaders in task forces and consortia\\n Building capacity in critical parts of the system (e.g., responsible recruitment, worker communication tools and monitoring technology)\\nTo gain deeper insight into these chains and the day-to-day experiences of workers, our associates also conduct on-site visits; cross-functional teams from Walmart undertook several such visits in 2018. Such on-site visits not only improve our ability to collaborate on whole-system change initiatives, they also help us improve our merchandising and responsible sourcing practices.\\nTwo human rights issues that we are particularly focused on through our responsible sourcing work and collaborative initiatives are forced labor and worker safety.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n58\\nForced labor\\nWalmart has prioritized working with others to combat forced labor in the global supply chain. Example efforts include:\\n Responsible recruitment: As a member of the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment, Walmart works to create demand for ethically recruited workers in Thailand and Malaysia and advocate for better government regulation of recruitment agencies.\\n Seafood Task Force: Since 2015 we have participated in this international, multistakeholder initiative to address forced labor and illegal fishing in the Thai seafood supply chain. The Seafood Task Force has developed supply chain maps, established a system to track products across the supply chain, worked with government and industry stakeholders to improve regulation and codes of conduct, and championed fishery improvement projects. In FY2019, the Task Force Board approved the Vessel Auditable Standards, which extend auditing practices and performance expectations to fishing boats, beyond ports and land-based monitoring. Walmart also participates in the Tuna subgroup.\\n Immersive field visits: These visits help Walmart teams better understand complex forced labor issues in supply chains such as tuna. For example, a team comprised of Global Sourcing, Responsible Sourcing, Sustainability and Corporate Affairs visited Thailand and the Marshall Islands to explore the canned tuna supply chain. The team visited tuna boats, met workers, interviewed captains, saw processing plants and canning facilities, and observed unloading and loading processes.\\nThe Walmart Foundation also aims to decrease the risk of forced labor through philanthropic investments focused on: (1) strengthening demand\\n\\nfor responsible labor and practices; (2) using data and technology to increase transparency; (3) enhancing worker and community voice; and (4) supporting efforts to improve enforcement of existing regulations. For example, in FY2019, the Walmart Foundation provided support to FishWise to develop the Roadmap for Improving Seafood Ethics (RISE), an online platform that details steps companies can take to improve responsible practices in seafood supply chains. By providing tailored recommendations to producers, processors, brands and retailers on how to build, assess and improve social practices -- and track progress toward more ethical performance -- RISE can help drive advancements in worker dignity in fishing supply chains around the world.\\nAs another example, in 2016, the Walmart Foundation made a grant to International Justice Mission (IJM), building upon funding from other institutions, to help open the IJM Bangkok office to work alongside the Royal Thai Government as it combats human trafficking networks in the Thai fishing industry. Learn more at Walmart.org.\\nWalmart also supports the nonprofit Truckers Against Trafficking, which trains and encourages transportation professionals to recognize and report suspected human trafficking incidents. In 2015, Walmart conducted a training initiative with its private fleet drivers in the identification and prevention of human trafficking. In FY2020, Walmart plans to incorporate that same training into its newdriver onboarding process.\\nWorker safety\\nWe expect our suppliers to provide a safe working environment. To address systemic issues affecting worker conditions more broadly, we collaborate with other companies, NGOs and experts. For example, in 2013, Walmart was a founding member of the Alliance\\n\\nfor Bangladesh Worker Safety, which provided extensive fire safety training; gave access to a 24hour, confidential helpline to report safety and other job-related concerns; and supported remediation of factory safety issues. According to the Alliance\\'s fifth annual report, 90% of high-priority remediation items were complete across all factories affiliated with the Alliance, and nearly 1.6 million workers have been trained in fire safety. More than 1.5 million workers now have access to the 24-hour confidential helpline. While the Alliance\\'s commitment ended in 2018, Walmart remains dedicated to worker safety in Bangladesh.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n59\\nInclusive sourcing\\n\\nQUICK FACTS\\nWalmart and Sam\\'s Clubs sourced more than $11 billion from diverse suppliers38 in the U.S.\\n\\nAccording to data from our suppliers, approximately two-thirds of what we spend to buy products for Walmart U.S. goes toward items that are made, sourced or grown in the U.S.\\n\\nWe use the power of our purchase order as a development tool in two ways: to promote diverse suppliers and to support small producers in emerging markets.\\nDiverse sourcing\\nOur supplier inclusion statement, signed by Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, highlights our belief that a diverse supply chain enables us to deliver better products and a broader selection to the communities we serve.\\nWalmart does business with more than 2,800 diverse suppliers39 who represent products in Walmart stores and on Walmart.com. In the U.S., Walmart and Sam\\'s Club sourced more than $11 billion from diverse suppliers in FY2019. Of this, $10.6 billion was for merchandising and $1.2 billion was for other goods and professional services.\\n\\nWe are also a member of the Billion Dollar Roundtable, which celebrates corporations that achieve spending of at least $1 billion with diverse businesses and adhere to the classification and reporting standards established by this organization.\\nUsing the National Minority Supplier Development Council\\'s and Women\\'s Business Enterprise National Council\\'s standard diverse business ownership definitions as benchmarks, we track diversity in our supply chain under the following diverse classifications: Women, African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Native Alaskans, members of the LGBT community, veterans, disabled veterans and other people with disabilities.\\nFor more information on our supplier diversity work, please see our Supplier Inclusion website.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\nPolicies & resources\\n\\nSupplier Inclusion Handbook\\n\\n\\n\\n60\\nMarket access for smallholders in emerging markets\\nWalmart works to help develop small suppliers in countries around the globe, enabling them to establish their businesses as part of the regional retail supply chain. Beyond Walmart\\'s supply chain, the Walmart Foundation invests in programs to help enhance livelihoods for produce growers in Mexico, smallplot farmers in India and small enterprises in South Africa. For example, in India where smallholder farmers represent the backbone of the country\\'s economy, the Walmart Foundation, working beyond Walmart\\'s supply chain, made a commitment in 2018 to invest $25 million over the next five years to improve farmer livelihoods. At the same time, Walmart India has committed to source 25% of produce sold in its Cash & Carry stores from India\\'s smallholder farmers.\\nWhen the Walmart Foundation seeks out market access programs to support, we focus our funding on programs that help address women\\'s inclusion and empowerment. We ask about the design of projects and disaggregating data to understand any disproportionate impacts on program participants.\\nNearly\\n$30 BILLION*\\nspent with women-owned businesses in the past 7 years\\n*Totals for merchandising and services combined\\n\\nInvesting in American jobs\\nOur U.S. customers and communities are passionate about supporting American manufacturing. In 2013, we announced our goal of purchasing an additional $250 billion in products that will support American jobs through 2023. According to Boston Consulting Group, this initiative could create 1 million new U.S. jobs, including 250,000 manufacturing jobs directly, and 750,000 support and service sector jobs indirectly. We have achieved 94% of what we had initially estimated for this point and we are making steady progress across categories.\\nTo raise awareness of our initiative and encourage suppliers to identify new product opportunities, Walmart hosted the fifth annual Open Call for new U.S.-made products in June 2018. Entrepreneurs from 46 states participated in more than 500 meetings where they had an opportunity to pitch their products for Walmart stores.\\nWe have also:\\n Published the Policy Roadmap to Renew U.S. Manufacturing, outlining what government, manufacturers and retailers can do to create manufacturing areas of opportunity.\\n Released a report on the future of work in the U.S. on a county-by-county basis.\\n Established the Jobs in U.S. Manufacturing Portal for suppliers to access our knowledge base on the U.S. manufacturing industry.\\nAccording to data from our suppliers, approximately two-thirds of what we spend to buy products for Walmart U.S. goes toward items that are made, sourced or grown in the U.S.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n61\\nProviding safer, healthier food & other products\\n\\nPolicies & resources\\n\\nFood Safety Policy\\n\\n\\n\\nProduct Safety & Compliance Policy \\n\\nSustainable Chemistry Commitment \\n\\nQUICK FACTS\\nWalmart was one of the founders of the Global Food Safety Initiative\\nMore than 4,990 food facilities that provide products to Walmart stores and Sam\\'s Clubs have been certified to one of the Global Food Safety Initiative\\'s standards\\nIn FY2019, we conducted more than 140,000 independent food safety audits at our stores and clubs globally\\nIn September 2018, Walmart U.S. required our existing fresh leafy green (e.g., romaine lettuce and spinach) suppliers to use blockchain technology for end-to-end traceability to help execute more targeted recalls and withdrawals\\nWalmart was the first U.S. retailer to announce a time-bound chemical footprint reduction goal\\nThrough our Wellness events, which take place four times per year, Walmart has provided ~3.3 million free health screenings to people across the U.S.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n62\\nFood\\nFood safety\\nAs the world\\'s largest grocer, we are committed to playing a leading role in upholding food safety laws and regulations applicable to our global businesses, and to providing access to safe, high-quality foods. We helped found the Global Food Safety Initiative, and we are guided by our Food Safety Policy. Our Global Food Safety Compliance team includes food safety professionals who are responsible for overseeing a comprehensive Food Safety program in every market where we operate.\\nTo reduce food-safety-related risk in our supply chain, we require all private-brand suppliers and select categories of national-brand suppliers to achieve certification to one of the Global Food Safety Initiative\\'s internationally recognized food safety standards, which often exceed applicable regulatory requirements.\\nSince the initial rollout of this requirement, more than 4,990 food facilities that provide products to Walmart stores and Sam\\'s Clubs have been certified. Studies published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Food Protection have shown that Global Food Safety Initiative certification tends to help suppliers in strengthening their ability to produce safe foods and comply with regulations.\\nWe also strive to improve transparency and the traceability of the products we carry through technology such as blockchain. For example, Walmart China, working with IBM and Jinluo Meat Co., completed a proofofconcept pilot that dramatically reduced the time needed to trace select pork products back to the farm using blockchain. And, in the wake of E. coli outbreaks in 2018, Walmart U.S. asked our existing suppliers of\\n\\nleafy greens (e.g., romaine lettuce and spinach) to use blockchain technology to trace their products back to the farms where they originated.\\n\\nBlockchain technology has the potential to shine a light on all actors in the food system. This enhanced transparency can result in greater accountability, improved safety and more sustainable practices.\\n\\nThrough regular independent, third-party food safety audits of our stores and clubs that prepare fresh food, we assess adherence to Walmart food safety standards, processes, conditions and expected behaviors. These risk-based audits help us receive independent assurances that our stores are operating in a safe and legal manner.\\n\\nIn FY2019, we conducted\\n\\nmore than 140,000 independent food safety audits at our stores and clubs globally.\\nIn October 2016,\\n\\n>140,000\\nindependent food safety audits conducted globally\\n\\nWalmart created the\\n\\nBeijing-based Walmart Food Safety Collaboration\\n\\nCenter (WFSCC) to bring together local and\\n\\ninternational research into the root causes and\\n\\nprevention of foodborne illness.

Products identified with the Great for You icon have met nutrition criteria informed by the latest science and guidance from the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture and Institute of Medicine. The Great for You initiative has been recognized by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation as a leading nutrition program.

Through Walmart\\'s food donations and additional philanthropic investments from Walmart and the Walmart Foundation, we met the goal we set in FY2014 to provide 4 billion meals to people in need by 2020, largely through the donation of unsold food. As of November 2018, we had also put funding in place to reach 4 million people with nutrition education. In FY2019, Walmart stores, clubs and distribution centers in the U.S. donated more than 640 million pounds of food, over 55% of which was fruits, vegetables and meat. Globally, Walmart donated a total of 720 million pounds of food in FY2019.\\nFor more information on our hunger relief and nutrition education efforts, please visit Walmart.org.\\n\\nProduct safety\\nWe are committed to providing our customers and members with access to safe and affordable merchandise.

The commitment asks suppliers to accelerate product reformulation, improve ingredient transparency and certify products using credible accreditations such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\\'s Safer Choice program.\\nLast year, we became the first U.S. retailer to announce a time-bound chemical footprint reduction goal and set a commitment to report annually to the Chemical Footprint Project. Our consumables chemical footprint is based on Walmart\\'s Priority Chemical list and includes chemicals such as formaldehyde and phthalates. By 2022, we aim to reduce the chemical footprint in personal care, beauty, baby, pet and household cleaning categories in U.S. stores by 10%. Our baseline for this goal is our calendar year 2017 footprint of approximately 190 million pounds for Walmart U.S. and approximately 30 million pounds for Sam\\'s Club.

Through our Healthcare Begins Here platform we offer customers health insurance education and enrollment services in stores, online and via call centers during annual enrollment periods for Medicare and Affordable Care Act plans.\\nFor more information, including our Health and Wellness Policy, please visit our Health and Wellness compliance website and Health and Wellness blog.\\nOpioids\\nOpioid abuse and dependence are a serious public health issue that touches our communities, patients and associates. Walmart is committed to taking a leadership role on this issue and has developed a comprehensive opioid stewardship initiative with policies, programs and tools aimed at helping prevent opioid abuse and dependence.\\nWalmart and Sam\\'s Club limit the initial opioid prescription for an acute condition (one expected\\n\\nto heal fairly quickly) to 7 days -- informed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\'s guidelines. This limit helps reduce the number of pills dispensed, which both reduces the likelihood that the patient will become dependent upon opioids and reduces the volume of opioids that could be diverted for inappropriate uses by someone other than the patient.\\nWalmart and Sam\\'s Club pharmacists participate in opioid-related training programs and use their knowledge to educate patients on the risks of opioid use and to recommend the overdose medication, naloxone, for patients who may be at risk for overdose. Certain patients can be at risk of overdose even when using an opioid for a legitimate medical purpose. We also invest in drug education programs for youth in our communities. We offer a free, athome opioid disposal product to patients.\\nThese are just a few of the ways Walmart is working to address opioid abuse and misuse, and we are committed to adding new initiatives and partnerships to continue to serve as a corporate leader and partner to our communities.

We use the feedback we receive from our associates to understand the issues that are paramount to them, and we try to respond as effectively as possible.\\nTransparency and communication are key to driving Walmart\\'s internal culture of trust, and we are committed to continual improvement in these efforts. For more on how we engage with our associates and integrate their feedback into the business, see our Associate voice section.\\n\\nCustomers\\nUnderstanding the needs of our customers is a top priority. We use a variety of channels to solicit feedback and communicate with our customers. These include:\\n Focused research through surveys and inperson discussions\\n Social media interaction through managed Facebook and Twitter pages\\n In-person communication in our stores\\n Outreach through email and phone, as well as communication through our customer call centers\\nWe have listened to our customers\\' questions regarding topics such as product country of origin, nutrition profile of foods, ingredients and responsible sourcing, and are working to respond to their preferences.\\n\\nSuppliers and others in the supply chain\\nAn important lever in achieving the system-wide change we aspire to is the power of our purchase orders and our relationships with our suppliers. Therefore, we use multiple channels to communicate with them. We engage with our suppliers to share our standards and expectations; provide trainings; receive their feedback and input on a variety of topics; and help improve the sustainability of supply chains. For example:\\n Walmart\\'s Responsible Sourcing Academy houses information about our standards for worker safety in factories, training, best practices and educational materials developed by third parties and by Walmart.\\n We provide additional outreach and support for minority- and women-owned businesses to increase the diversity of our supplier pipeline.\\n\\n2019 Walmart ESG Report\\n\\nOUR APPROACH\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG DATA\\n\\n72\\n We host a variety of live and online events, communicate at trade events and keep in close communication with suppliers via timely updates.\\n We encourage suppliers to report through the Sustainability Index, a science-based, third-party tool developed by The Sustainability Consortium in collaboration with universities, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and suppliers.\\nFor more information on how we interact with our suppliers, please see the Responsible supply chains, Project Gigaton and the Sustainable chemistry sections of this report.\\nCommunities\\nAt Walmart, we work hard to support the communities where we operate and where our associates and customers live.

We believe that sound public policy is the result of good-faith government and stakeholder actions that promote the intersection of those interests. Whether the issue involves federal or state taxation, trade, technology or policies related to the workforce of the future, we advocate with a view toward the long-term interests of our associates, our customers and the communities in which we work and live. We are committed to providing substantive and technical input and advice to legislative bodies and executive agencies across all issues where we have expertise and make it a practice to do so in ways that build relationships of trust.\\nNGOs, advisory councils and grantees\\nMany problems facing the world today, from deforestation to human trafficking, are beyond the scope of any single organization to resolve. Because we aim to create lasting impact and system-wide change, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation collaborate with leading third parties to help solve complex problems.\\n\\nWe have direct dialogue with many institutions -- both our critics and advocates -- to understand critical ESG issues and the role Walmart can play to help address them. We have created and engaged with several advisory councils to offer critical input on Walmart\\'s business and ESG practices and initiatives.

We expect to invest approximately $4 billion in our second quarter alone on COVID-related initiatives getting products to customers and keeping employees safe. While this is a major commitment, it won\\'t come at the expense of our commitment to sustainability and The Climate Pledge. To do anything different would be to ignore the fact that--as the pandemic has demonstrated-- we are all interconnected and interdependent. We know there is a lot of uncertainty in the world, and we also know that during these critical times, it is more important than ever to double down on our commitments relating to the climate crisis. In 2019, we made a big bet on the capabilities of our company to innovate, use our scale for good, and go faster to address the urgency of the climate crisis. We also launched The Climate Pledge, inviting other companies to join with us on this path.\\nT HIS M OM E NT we are in now has already taught us immeasurable things about how the world can and might function going forward. The planetary pause that COVID-19 has brought about to most continents--if not all at this point--shows us what happens when some of these changes happen on our planet. Planetary stability is of course tied to economic stability and the health and well-being of all people. We have yet to see what a post-COVID recovery will entail, or what the impact will be on our ability to maintain clean air, access to health, and thriving communities. With the devastation that has occurred, there is also some optimism that we might be able learn from this moment to build back our communities with more resiliency and protections for people and our planet.\\nWe expect to invest approximately $4 billion in our second quarter alone on COVID-related\\ninitiatives getting products to customers.\\nAT AM AZON, we first began discussing the possibility of company-wide net zero commitments during a senior planning summit in 2016. We knew that to continue to be a relentlessly resilient and innovative business, we would need to deeply understand what is happening on our planet. We also knew that we would need to build and dedicate financial resources, intellectual capital, and change management work to creating the tools, data, and understanding about how to achieve these types of commitments.\\nFOU R YE ARS L AT ER , our bold commitment to integrating sustainability across the company has not changed, and it will not change another five or ten years from now. What has changed, however, is the way in which we are conducting our business, running our operations, funding and implementing new technologies and services that decarbonize and help preserve the natural world, along with the ambitious goals we have set, starting with The Climate Pledge--our commitment to reach net zero carbon by 2040, a decade ahead of the Paris Agreement. We\\'re all in on our goals and our work to build a better planet, on urgent action to drive a lasting change: to see the world transition through this current pandemic into a world that embraces a sustainable path to recovery and wellness.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY INTRODUCTION\\n\\n4\\nAbout\\n06 Goals and Strategies 10 The Climate Pledge 12 Right Now Climate Fund 14 The Climate Pledge Fund 15 Customers 18 Amazon Around the Globe\\nGoals and Strategies\\nAmazon is committed to building a sustainable business for our customers and the planet.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\\n\\n6\\nOur Commitments\\nAmazon has been committed to sustainability for many years. In 2019, Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge--a commitment to be net zero carbon across our business by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. As part of this pledge, Amazon has made ambitious commitments toward reaching this goal:\\n2040 Net Zero Carbon Deploying our technology and people to reach net zero carbon across our business by 2040.\\n2030 Shipment Zero\\nMaking all Amazon shipments net zero carbon through Shipment Zero, with 50% of all shipments net zero carbon by 2030.\\n2025 Renewable Energy On a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\\n\\n7\\n100,000 Electric Delivery Vehicles Purchasing 100,000 electric delivery vehicles, the largest order ever of electric delivery vehicles.\\n$100MM Right Now Climate Fund Investing $100 million in reforestation projects and climate mitigation solutions.\\n$2B Climate Pledge Fund\\nInvesting $2 billion to support the development of technologies and services that decarbonize and help preserve the natural world.\\nTo meet these goals, teams across Amazon are taking a broad, sciencebased approach to measuring, reducing, and eliminating carbon emissions in our operations. As part of our commitment to The Climate Pledge, we are proud to join the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), reaffirming our commitment to reduce carbon emissions in line with our ongoing sciencebased approach to tackle climate change. SBTi is a collaboration between CDP, World Resources Institute (WRI), the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC); it is one of the We Mean Business Coalition commitments.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\\n\\n8\\nHere is a closer look at the work we are doing:\\nRenewable Energy\\nAmazon is on a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025. In 2019, we reached 42% renewable energy across our business. As of December 2020, Amazon has 127 solar and wind projects across the globe that have the capacity to generate over 6,500 megawatts and deliver more than 18 million megawatt hours of energy annually--enough to power more than 1.7 million U.S. homes.\\nShipment Zero\\nShipment Zero is Amazon\\'s vision to make all Amazon shipments net zero carbon, with a goal of delivering 50% of shipments with net zero carbon by 2030. Shipment Zero means that the fulfillment operations we undertake to deliver a customer\\'s shipment are net zero carbon--from the fulfillment center where an item is picked off the shelf, to the materials used to package the item, and the mode of transportation that gets the package to the customer\\'s door.\\nElectric Vehicles\\nIn 2019, Amazon ordered 100,000 new electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, a U.S. electric vehicle manufacturer. This order, the largest order ever of electric delivery vehicles, sends a signal to the marketplace to start inventing and developing new technologies that large, global companies need to transition to a low-carbon economy. Amazon plans to have 10,000 of the new electric vehicles on the road as early as 2022 and all 100,000 vehicles on the road by 2030.\\nSustainable Packaging\\nAmazon created our Frustration-Free Packaging program to encourage manufacturers to package their products in easy-to-open, 100% recyclable packaging that is ready to ship to customers without the need for an additional shipping box. Since 2015, we have reduced the weight of outbound packaging by 33% and eliminated more than 900,000 tons of packaging material, the equivalent of 1.6 billion shipping boxes.\\nRight Now Climate Fund\\nAmazon established the Right Now Climate Fund, a $100 million fund to restore and conserve forests, wetlands, and grasslands around the world. Through the Right Now Climate Fund, Amazon is taking immediate action to remove or avoid carbon emissions by supporting nature-based climate solutions. Amazon is working with The Nature Conservancy to identify projects around the world that can create real and lasting carbon reductions, while also empowering communities, enhancing natural environments, and protecting wildlife.\\nClimate Pledge Fund\\nIn June 2020, Amazon announced The Climate Pledge Fund to support the development of sustainable and decarbonizing technologies and services that will enable Amazon and other companies to meet the goals set by The Climate Pledge. This dedicated investment program--with an initial $2 billion in funding--will invest in visionary companies whose products and solutions will facilitate the transition to a low carbon economy.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\\n\\n9\\nThe Climate Pledge was founded in 2019 by Amazon and Global Optimism. The Pledge calls on signatories to be net zero carbon across their businesses by 2040, a decade\\nahead of the Paris Agreement goal of 2050.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\\n\\n10\\nCompanies that sign The Climate Pledge agree to:\\nRegular Reporting\\nSignatories agree to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis.\\nCarbon Elimination\\nSignatories will implement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement through real business change and innovations,\\nincluding efficiency improvements, renewable energy, materials reductions, and other carbon emission elimination strategies.\\nCredible Offsets\\nSignatories must take actions to neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially-beneficial\\noffsets to achieve net zero annual carbon emissions by 2040.\\n\\n\"Bold steps by big companies will make a huge difference in the development of new technologies and industries to support a low carbon economy.\"\\n Christiana Figueres, Former Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and Co-Founder of Global Optimism\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\\n\\n11\\nRight Now Climate Fund\\nAmazon established the Right Now Climate Fund, a $100 million fund to restore and conserve forests, wetlands, and grasslands around the world. Through the Right Now Climate Fund, we are taking immediate action to remove or avoid carbon emissions by supporting nature-based climate solutions.\\nPriorities of the Right Now Climate Fund\\nWe support nature-based solutions, which refer to conservation, restoration, and improved land management actions that increase carbon storage or avoid greenhouse gas emissions in forests, wetlands, and grasslands across the globe.\\n Support \"And/Also\" Solutions: We use multiple solutions to reduce carbon emissions--driving reductions across our business operations and also supporting nature-based solutions.\\n Demonstrate Immediate Action: We demonstrate immediate action toward reducing carbon in the atmosphere and mitigating the adverse effects of climate change.\\n Promote Global Scale: We catalyze and promote nature-based solutions globally, and prioritize projects that can be scaled broadly.\\n Optimize for Carbon Mitigation: We fund projects that optimize for carbon removed or avoided, while also being additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially-beneficial.\\n Improve Market Mechanisms: We improve market mechanisms in order to increase the worldwide quality, supply, and demand for carbon offsets.\\nGlobal Projects\\nAmazon is working with The Nature Conservancy to identify projects that can create real and lasting carbon reductions, while also empowering communities, enhancing natural environments, and protecting wildlife.\\nFamily Forest Carbon Program and Forest Carbon Co-ops: In April 2020, Amazon announced the funding of $10 million toward two projects that will help U.S. family forest owners sequester carbon and support expansion across Appalachia and other U.S. regions. Scientists at The Nature Conservancy have identified this network of climate-resilient forests as most able to thrive in the face of climate change. Amazon, The Nature Conservancy, the American Forest Foundation, and the Vermont Land Trust are partnering on two innovative projects--the Family Forest Carbon Program and Forest Carbon Co-ops.\\nThe Family Forest Carbon Program will open up carbon credit markets to small family forest owners for the first time. Amazon\\'s commitment will expand the program in the Appalachians and other U.S. regions and go towards designing new methods for measuring and verifying reforestation and forest management practices. The Forest Carbon Co-op will help owners of mid-sized forests use sustainable forest management and protection measures to earn income through the\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\\n\\n12\\ncarbon credit market. Amazon\\'s grant will support efforts to expand the program in climate resilient forests across the Appalachians, develop a scientific approach to regional carbon impact measurement, and enhance the project verification methodology. Amazon is the largest funder of these programs and will help:\\n Conserve and sustainably manage forest land and wildlife in the Appalachian region, with plans to expand the projects across 4 million acres of the 2,000-mile span of the Appalachians, and beyond.\\n Generate economic opportunities by creating a new source of income for family forest owners and rural communities that taps into the carbon storage potential of forests. In the U.S., families and individuals own the largest portion of forests (38%)--more than the federal government or corporations.\\n Achieve a net reduction of up to 18.5 million metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere by 2031--the equivalent of the emissions of nearly 4 million U.S. cars in a year.\\nUrban Greening in Germany: Amazon is supporting The Nature Conservancy in an effort to reduce climate change risks and increase species biodiversity in three German cities. The initial project is in Berlin\\'s Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district. Learnings will be applied in two other German locations, and then shared across other European cities. With this, Amazon is recognizing the urgency of the climate crisis and its impacts on urban communities.\\nAmazon\\'s commitment will fund The Nature Conservancy\\'s Urban Greening program, which uses nature-based solutions to help cities become more climate-change resilient. The program will collaborate with city officials and local community organizations to create and implement plans for:\\n Reducing flood risk by improving rainwater retention through tree planting, revitalizing urban wetlands, and adapting existing green spaces;\\n Reducing extreme heat and pollution by leveraging unused public spaces to plant trees and improving urban water bodies;\\n Increasing urban biodiversity by introducing pollinator-friendly species, climate resilient plants, and urban grasslands.\\nThe program starts in the Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district of Berlin and uses a science-based, municipality-wide, and stakeholder-based approach to urban greening to ensure that projects are complementing existing local efforts. Two additional German cities will be chosen, in which the initial learnings from Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf will be applied. The goal is to share a guide to urban greening with municipalities across Europe by the end of the five-year project.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\\n\\n13\\nThe Climate Pledge Fund\\nIn June 2020, Amazon announced The Climate Pledge Fund to support the development of sustainable and decarbonizing technologies and services that will enable Amazon and other companies to meet the goals set by The Climate Pledge. This dedicated investment program--with an initial $2 billion in funding--will invest in visionary companies whose products and solutions will facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy.\\nIn order to meaningfully reduce the amount of net greenhouse gas emissions, low-carbon solutions need to be developed in all sectors of the global economy. The Climate Pledge Fund will invest in companies in multiple industries, with an initial focus on: transportation and logistics; energy generation, storage, and utilization; manufacturing and materials; circular economy; and food and agriculture. Companies of all sizes and stages will be considered, from preproduct startups to well-established enterprises looking to scale. The scope of The Climate Pledge Fund is global and will consider investments in companies developing products or services that reduce carbon emissions and help preserve the natural world.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\\n\\n14\\nCustomers\\nAmazon is committed to making it easier for our customers to participate in making a positive impact on the planet and society.\\n\\nsmile.amazon.com\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\\n\\n15\\nEnabling Sustainability for our Customers\\nAmazon has set ambitious goals to make our business more sustainable on behalf of customers.

We measure our total impact on the climate, map the largest activities contributing to this impact, and use this information to develop meaningful carbon reduction goals, including our overall goal to reach net zero carbon across Amazon by 2040.\\nOur carbon footprint includes emissions from Amazon-operated and third-party freight, electricity use, Amazon branded products, capital goods, business travel, packaging, customer trips to Amazon\\'s stores, and other purchased goods and services. The system boundary of our carbon footprint meets widely adopted international standards, including the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and ISO 14064. Our carbon footprint is externally assured by Apex.\\nThrough our commitment to The Climate Pledge, Amazon is investing in a range of large-scale solutions to decarbonize our business, some with immediate carbon savings and others with longerterm payoffs. We have already seen an improvement in the carbon intensity of our business in 2019 as a result of operational efficiencies such as energy efficiency technologies in fulfillment centers and alternative vehicle pilots. Carbon intensity is the metric we use to benchmark our performance year over year, as it provides a relative comparison between annual performance metrics regardless of other changes to our business. While Amazon\\'s net sales increased 22% in 2019 (excluding changes in foreign exchange rates), our total carbon footprint increased 15% during the same period. While still early days, our 2019 carbon intensity metric is 122.8 grams of CO2e per GMS, down 5% year over year from 128.9 grams of CO2e per dollar in 2018.\\nLike many companies in high growth mode, we look at the absolute tons of carbon in our footprint, but also at how we are improving our carbon intensity. Our first year-over-year comparison shows progress as we continue to make investments in innovation, technologies, and products that will decarbonize our operations over future years.\\nThese investments include renewable energy projects like our new solar farm in Virginia, and our order of 100,000 electric delivery vehicles, which will be on the road delivering packages to customers starting in 2021. It will take several years for the carbon reduction benefits of these investments to be fully reflected in our carbon footprint. Over time, both our carbon intensity and our absolute carbon footprint will drop as we continue to make progress toward net zero carbon. With the launch of The Climate Pledge Fund, we look forward to making additional major investments in the coming years that will result in long-term payoffs.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n21\\nAmazon\\'s 2019 Carbon Footprint Categories\\n\\nMMT COe\\n\\nEmissions from Direct Operations (Scope 1) Fossil Fuels Refrigerants\\n\\n5.76 5.57 0.19\\n\\nEmissions from Purchased Electricity (Scope 2)\\n\\n5.50\\n\\nEmissions from Indirect Sources (Scope 3)\\n\\n39.91\\n\\nCorporate purchases and Amazon-branded product emissions (e.g., operating expenses, business travel, and Amazon-branded product manufacturing, use phase, and end of life)\\n\\n15.41\\n\\nCapital goods (e.g., building construction, servers and other 8.01\\nhardware, equipment, vehicles)\\n\\nOther indirect emissions (e.g., third-party transportation, packaging, grid line losses)\\n\\n12.44\\n\\nLifecycle emissions from customer trips to Amazon\\'s physical stores\\n\\n4.05\\n\\nAmazon\\'s Total Footprint\\n\\n51.17\\n\\nOur carbon intensity metric, measured as grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (COe) per dollar of Gross Merchandise Sales (GMS), is equal to 122.8 COe per dollar (USD).\\n\\nCarbon Methodology\\nLearn more about the science and technology behind our carbon footprint. amzn.to/measuring-carbon\\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions Verification Statement\\nRead the greenhouse gas emissions verification statement from Apex. amzn.to/carbon-assurance\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n22\\nRenewable Energy\\nAmazon is on a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025 as part of our goal to reach net zero carbon by 2040. In 2019, we reached 42% renewable energy across our business.\\nAmazon has 127 solar and wind projects across the globe that have the capacity to generate over 6,500 megawatts (MW) and deliver more than 18 million megawatt hours (MWh) of energy annually--enough to power more than 1.7 million U.S. homes. These projects supply renewable energy for Amazon\\'s corporate offices, fulfillment centers, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers that support millions of customers globally.\\nIn March 2020, Amazon announced four new renewable energy projects--the first in Australia, second in Sweden, second in Spain, and eleventh in the Commonwealth of Virginia in the U.S. We announced five new renewable energy projects in China, Australia, and the U.S. in May 2020. In December 2020, Amazon announced plans to add 26 utility-scale wind and solar energy projects, bringing our total investment in renewable energy in 2020 to 35 projects and more than 4 gigawatts (GW) of capacity--the largest corporate investment in renewable energy in a single year. These new projects will make Amazon the largest-ever corporate purchaser of renewable energy.\\nOne of our latest solar projects in the U.S. is a solar farm in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, which will power Amazon\\'s new Virginia headquarters and other Amazon-owned operations across the Commonwealth, including Whole Foods Markets and fulfillment centers. The project is planned for completion by the first quarter of 2022. Amazon has contracted 82 MW of the new 120 MW solar farm, which is expected to generate 172,500 MWh of renewable energy annually.\\nOur largest wind project to date, Amazon Wind Farm Texas, is a 253 MW wind farm in Scurry County in the western part of the state. With more than 100 turbines, the project generates 1 million MWh of wind energy annually--enough to power almost 90,000 U.S. homes for a year.\\nRenewable Energy Methodology\\nLearn more about how we calculate Amazon\\'s renewable energy use. amzn.to/renewable-percentage\\nRenewable Energy Assurance Statement\\nRead the renewable energy assurance statement from Apex. amzn.to/energy-assurance\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n23\\nShipment Zero\\nShipment Zero is Amazon\\'s vision to make all Amazon shipments net zero carbon, with a goal of delivering 50% of shipments with net zero carbon by 2030.\\n\\nShipment Zero means that the fulfillment operations we undertake to deliver a customer\\'s shipment are net zero carbon-- from the fulfillment center where an item is picked off the shelf, to the materials used to package the item, and the mode of transportation that gets the package to the customer\\'s door. We are working to launch Shipment Zero deliveries in Europe and the U.S., followed by India, Japan, and all other geographies where we operate across the globe.\\nThe emissions sources considered in scope for Shipment Zero are:\\n1. Electricity emissions from powering operations facilities and vehicle charging;\\n2. Transportation tailpipe emissions from the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles that transport shipments from inventory to the customer;\\n3. Emissions from manufacturing and transporting the materials used in outbound packaging.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n24\\nFulfillment Facilities\\nA Shipment Zero order will travel through fulfillment facilities powered by 100% clean energy from wind and solar projects dedicated to Amazon\\'s electricity needs and from the grid. Customer shipments pass through the following types of facilities, all powered by clean energy:\\n Fulfillment centers where Amazon associates pick, pack, and ship customer orders;  Sortation centers where customer orders are sorted by final destination and then consolidated for delivery;  Delivery stations where orders are prepared for last-mile delivery to a customer\\'s door.\\nMore than 60 Amazon facilities across the globe are already powered by on-site solar panels, which generate as much as 80% of a single fulfillment facility\\'s annual energy needs.\\nPackaging\\nA Shipment Zero order will be shipped without added Amazon packaging or in carbon neutral packaging. Ships In Own Container (SIOC) is a tier of certification within Amazon\\'s Frustration-Free Packaging program, certifying that a product\\'s original packaging is designed to ship without the need for an Amazon shipping box. We work closely with manufacturers to develop and test packaging that meets SIOC certification, and we share these innovations publicly to drive improvements across the industry. In India, we designed a new way to deliver customer orders packaging-free. Orders that ship in their original packaging are delivered in a protective, reusable crate in 100+ cities across India.\\nA second option is to ship in carbon neutral packaging that is made of net zero carbon materials, is produced with zero carbon emissions, and is delivered to Amazon fulfillment facilities using zero carbon. While we work to increase SIOCcertified products, expand packaging-free shipping programs, and develop carbon neutral packaging solutions, we will continue to pursue packaging improvements by optimizing the size and weight of shipping materials, inventing new recyclable mailers, and working with suppliers to streamline and innovate product packaging.\\nTransportation\\nA Shipment Zero order will be transported in a zero-emissions delivery vehicle or by a delivery associate on foot or on bicycle. Zero-emissions delivery vehicles are 100% battery electric or hydrogen-fueled, in addition to electric bikes and electric three-wheelers. Amazon\\'s order of 100,000 electric delivery vehicles in 2019 is a major stride toward zero carbon transportation across our global network, and we are proud to operate many electric vans and trucks today. We also leverage innovative technology to maximize efficiency on the road and reduce delivery distances by placing delivery stations close to large Amazon customer populations.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n25\\nSustainable Transportation\\nTransportation is a major component of Amazon\\'s business operations and a key part of our plan to meet net zero carbon by 2040. We are committed to optimizing and transforming our transportation network through innovations in electrification, efficiency enhancements, and alternative delivery methods.\\n\\nElectrifying Our Transport Fleets\\nIn 2019, Amazon ordered 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, a U.S. electric vehicle manufacturer. This order, the largest order ever of electric delivery vehicles, sends a signal to the marketplace to start inventing and developing new technologies that large, global companies need to transition to a low-carbon economy. We plan to start using these new vehicles from Rivian to deliver packages to customers by 2021, with 10,000 new vehicles on the road as early as 2022 and all 100,000 vehicles on the road by 2030. This is projected to save millions of metric tons of carbon per year by 2030.\\nAmazon already operates hundreds of electric vehicles across the globe. Amazon India is adding 10,000 electric delivery vehicles to its existing fleet by 2025, including 3-wheeler and 4-wheeler vehicles designed and manufactured in India. These vehicles are in addition to Amazon\\'s order of 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from Rivian. Across Europe, Amazon is contracting with our service providers to launch a low-pollution last-mile fleet comprised of electric and natural gas vans and cars. We have added hundreds of electric vehicle charging stations at our European facilities for our partners to use, with plans to expand this infrastructure to support more sustainable deliveries. We use electric cargo bikes in cities around the world, including a pilot in New York City in 2019. In North America, Amazon has also deployed electric yard hostlers, which are used to move trailers around facilities.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n26\\nMaximizing Efficiency on Current Vehicles\\nWhile we work to adopt the most efficient, cutting-edge vehicle technologies, we are also maximizing efficiencies on our existing fleets. Across North America and Europe, our fleet includes a mix of trailers in different sizes that are equipped with skirts (panels attached to the lower side edges of a trailer to make it more aerodynamic) and automatic tire inflation systems that keep tires properly inflated and maximize fuel efficiency.\\nWe use mud flaps designed to allow airflow and water to pass through them, minimizing drag and saving an average of 100 gallons of diesel fuel per vehicle annually. In Europe, we have deployed over 500 hydraulically powered doubledeck trailers. Double-deck trailers improve space utilization by up to 70% in comparison to standard semi-trailers, reducing the total number of trucks on the road.\\nOptimizing Our Delivery Logistics\\nAmazon is constantly working to optimize our delivery network and drive efficiencies in the process of delivering our products. To fulfill customer orders quickly, we have thousands of vehicles moving from fulfillment centers to delivery destinations. We use data and algorithms to consolidate as many shipments as possible onto one vehicle or plane. We also analyze which items are being ordered most frequently, by location, to ensure that the inventory of those items is stored nearby, minimizing the need to use planes or trucks for long-distance deliveries. By boosting efficiencies across our network, we are able to put fewer vehicles and planes into service.\\nUsing Alternative Delivery Methods\\nWe are continually piloting new or alternative ideas in different locations around the world in an effort to increase our efficiency and reduce emissions. In urban centers like New York City, we deliver packages on foot, have expanded our use of traditional bicycles, and use pedal-assist electric bikes connected to cargo trailers that can carry up to 45 packages. In India, our fleet includes electric three-wheelers and compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles. Electric bikes and CNG vehicles are also part of our delivery fleet in Europe. Additionally, we\\'re developing fully electric autonomous delivery services, such as the Amazon Scout device and Prime Air drones, which will make deliveries faster and more efficient than road deliveries.\\nPartnering with Experts and Industry\\nIn 2017, Amazon signed the Sustainable Fuel Buyers\\' Principles, demonstrating our commitment to working with service providers to accelerate the transition to low-carbon commercial transportation solutions. Members of the nonprofit Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) Future of Fuels group developed The Buyers\\' Principles and vetted them through its network of 600 expert and industry stakeholders. These principles outline criteria that will catalyze the partnerships needed to drive the transition to a sustainable road freight transportation system.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n27\\nSustainable Buildings\\nAs part of our commitment to The Climate Pledge, Amazon is working to reduce the carbon emissions associated with our buildings and facilities across the globe. We are transitioning our buildings to be net zero carbon, powered by renewable energy, and highly energy efficient, with demonstrated reductions in embodied carbon--the emissions associated with a building\\'s construction materials.\\nWe are also working to improve the resource efficiency of our buildings beyond energy, with a focus on water and waste reduction strategies across our facilities. In all of our buildings, we seek to create safe, productive, and inspiring spaces that support the health and well-being of our employees, local environment, and community, both inside and outdoors.\\nGreen Building Standards\\nWe are committed to holding our buildings to the highest standards of sustainable design, and we pursue third-party building certification when doing so accelerates our impact. Amazon has nearly 30 LEED certified buildings in the U.S. --the majority of which have Gold and Platinum level certification--and more than 20 BREEAM certified buildings across Europe. We also engage with industry-leading programs that support the transition to net zero carbon in the built environment, such as the Carbon Leadership Forum.\\nCorporate Offices\\nOur global corporate offices are often located in vibrant communities and urban hubs. When designing our offices, we strive to integrate seamlessly with these communities while creating easy outdoor access for our employees and visitors. Many of our buildings offer public plazas and open green spaces for communal and public use. Even more feature green roofs and other green infrastructure that provide outdoor amenity space while supporting ecological functions like stormwater management.\\nOur buildings\\' interiors integrate biophilic design concepts, such as green walls and locally-sourced woods, in addition to energy-efficient lighting, composting and recycling, and amenity spaces for employee wellness. Many Amazon buildings also offer plug-in electric vehicle charging stations for employees and visitors.\\nSustainability in Action at Our Seattle Campus: Our flagship Seattle campus features some of our most innovative sustainable design practices. A subterranean district energy system heats many of our buildings in the Denny Triangle neighborhood using waste heat generated from a neighboring data center. Above ground, employees and visitors can enjoy The Spheres, an indoor plant conservatory featuring 40,000 plants from the cloud forest regions of more than 30 countries, along with a 4,000 square foot green wall.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n28\\n100% Renewable Energy at HQ2 in Arlington: Our second U.S. headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, known as \"HQ2,\" will use 100% renewable energy to power the four-million-square-foot campus, which is scheduled to be completed by 2022. We are constructing a new solar farm in Pittsylvania County, Virginia to power HQ2 and other Amazon-owned operations in the area, including Whole Foods Market stores and nearby fulfillment centers. A portion of the renewable energy generated from this solar farm will be allocated to Arlington County, a move that also helps advance the county\\'s renewable energy goals. The location for the HQ2 campus was strategically determined to provide walkable access to public transportation, bike storage, and local amenities such as shops, restaurants, and childcare.\\nInternational Offices: We aim to take best practices from across our global locations and embed them at our offices all over the world. Our corporate offices in Munich, Germany, have been certified Gold for environmental design by the German Sustainable Building Council based on their energy-efficient interiors and use of sustainable building materials. In Luxembourg, efficient chillers and an advanced building management system cut energy costs, while rooftop beehives supply honey, and food is served in compostable and biodegradable containers.\\nOperations Facilities\\nWith more than 175 facilities covering 150 million square feet of space across the world, Amazon fulfillment centers, sortation centers, and delivery stations account for a major part of our embodied carbon. In 2020, Amazon began an in-depth study of our operations buildings in order to transition these facilities to net zero carbon. The study examines the energy intensity of these buildings and identifies ways to meet zero carbon through energy efficiency enhancements, new technology pilots, and significant reductions in embodied carbon. This year, Amazon will update its design templates and criteria to capture these changes, and apply net zero strategies across all global regions.\\nOn-Site Solar: Many of our facilities throughout the U.S., Europe, and India are powered by on-site solar, where a rooftop installation can power up to 80% of a facility\\'s energy use. In 2019, we achieved a goal to install solar technology on 50 rooftops worldwide by 2020, a year ahead of schedule. We now have more than 60 rooftop solar installations on operations facilities around the world and we continue to scale this program.\\nMinimizing Energy Use at Operations Facilities: Our operations facilities are designed with efficient building systems to minimize energy use. We are expanding our use of building control system technology and real-time data analytics to optimize our heating and cooling systems for occupant comfort while operating as efficiently as possible. We use highly-efficient motors and advanced controls in our conveyor systems to move packages efficiently throughout our facilities, and we are testing new technologies to further reduce the energy use of material handling equipment. Through building retrofits and energy studies, we are continuously improving and learning to optimize the efficiency of our operations, uncover savings opportunities, and help drive carbon out of our fulfillment operations.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n29\\nData Centers\\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) has always focused on efficiency and continuous innovation in our data centers to improve operational excellence and reduce our impact on the environment. In addition to our efforts on energy efficiency and our goal to achieve 100% renewable energy for our global infrastructure, AWS has multiple initiatives to improve our water use efficiency and reduce the use of potable (drinking) water for cooling data centers.\\nAWS develops our water use strategy by evaluating climate patterns for each AWS Region (a physical location around the world where we cluster data centers), local water management and availability, and the opportunity to conserve drinking water sources. Taking a holistic approach, we assess both the water and energy usage of each potential cooling solution to select the most efficient method.\\nWhole Foods Market\\nWhole Foods Market has several all-electric stores in California and dozens of buildings certified by LEED and Green Globes across North America. Every store provides a high-quality indoor experience for employees and customers, with ample daylight and amenity space. Stores in the San Francisco Bay Area have piloted a technology that combines advanced cloud computing, predictive analytics, and a thermal energy storage retrofit to modulate their refrigeration systems during peak energy.\\nWhole Foods Market is a founding partner of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\\'s GreenChill program, which helps food retailers transition to alternative refrigerants, reduce refrigerant charge sizes, eliminate leaks, and adopt green refrigeration technologies. Whole Foods Market has piloted various technologies to reduce carbon emissions from the use of refrigerants. For example, multiple stores across the U.S. and Canada use natural refrigerants, which contain zero ozone depletion potential and very low global warming potential.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n30\\nCircular Economy\\nWe are minimizing waste, increasing recycling, and providing options for our customers to\\nreuse, repair, and recycle their products--sending less material to the landfill and more back into the circular economy loop.\\n\\n31\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n31\\nRecycling\\nAmazon is committed to reducing our environmental footprint through recycling initiatives in our own operations and for our customers. We are developing new recycling infrastructure, inventing recyclable packaging materials, and investing in initiatives that support the recycling industry across the U.S.\\nRecycling Infrastructure\\nIn addition to optimizing our recycling efforts for common materials like cardboard, we are working to address the materials that are toughest to recycle in our operations. Plastic film, for example, is a difficult material to process and recycle, and is not accepted by most curbside recycling programs. To address this gap, Amazon is launching plastic film recycling at more than 55 fulfillment centers across our network. Through this program, we expect to recycle more than 7,000 tons of plastic film per year, in addition to the 1,500 tons of plastic already being recycled annually in Europe.\\nWe are also exploring alternative solutions for less common materials that cannot be recycled. In the UK, for example, we collect the silicone backing paper from shipping labels to convert into animal bedding. We are looking across our entire operations network to incorporate more of our own recycled plastic in products, packaging, and operational processes.\\nRecyclable Mailers\\nIn 2019, we launched a fully recyclable paper padded mailer that protects products during shipping while taking up less space in transit. This ensures customer deliveries arrive undamaged and in recyclable packaging with a lower carbon footprint. The recyclable mailer is made of four layers of paper and a water-based cushioning material using components commonly found in the glue used to make cardboard. The lightweight recyclable cushioning was specifically designed to easily separate from the paper in the same way that print inks and other paper coatings are removed during the paper recycling process.\\nRecycling Partnerships\\nAt Amazon, we know our customers care about minimizing the amount of waste that ends up in landfill. To improve curbside recycling in the U.S., we partnered with The Recycling Partnership, which supports communities and local governments with education, infrastructure, and measurement related to curbside recycling.\\nWe also invested $10 million in the Closed Loop Infrastructure Fund to finance recycling and circular economy infrastructure in North America. Through this investment, Amazon aims to increase product and packaging recycling, ensuring that material gets back into the manufacturing supply chain. Over the next decade, our investment in the Closed Loop Infrastructure Fund will improve curbside recycling for 3 million homes in communities across the U.S., diverting 1 million tons of recyclable material from landfill and eliminating the equivalent of 2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n32\\nAmazon Second Chance\\nAmazon Second Chance provides information on how to trade in, recycle, or repair products, how to recycle Amazon packaging, and how to find open-box and refurbished devices. Customers may visit Second Chance to learn about and compare programs that help eliminate waste and give products a second life.\\namzn.to/amsc\\nCustomers who have eligible items they no longer want can discover the Amazon Trade-In program, which allows them to receive an Amazon.com Gift Card in exchange for thousands of eligible items including Amazon devices, cell phones, video games, and more. In addition, customers wanting to responsibly dispose of their electronics can discover our device recycling program for a variety of electronics and related accessories.\\nAmazon also gives customers several options to shop for great deals on open-box or gently-used items. Amazon Warehouse --an online store for great deals on quality used products including furniture, toys, instruments, kitchen appliances, clothes, and more--has an extensive inspection process that ensures as many gently-used returned items as possible can be resold rather than being sent to landfill. Amazon Renewed offers refurbished, pre-owned, and open-box products such as computers, laptops, smartphones, tablets, cameras, audio devices, home appliances, and more. And Certified Refurbished and Used Amazon Devices provides customers access to pre-owned Amazon devices such as Echo, Fire Tablets, Kindle E-readers, and more. Certified Refurbished devices have been refurbished, tested, and internally certified by Amazon to look and work like new. All of these programs reduce waste and encourage reuse by ensuring that valuable products can go back into the hands of customers rather than being sent to landfills.\\nAmazon also encourages customers to fix the things they buy before replacing, returning, or disposing of them. Amazon offers free Product Support (on a select but growing number of items) with the goal of helping customers maximize the useful life of the things they already own. Product Support serves seven global geographies with technical support, parts replacement, and repair services. Helping customers responsibly dispose of Amazon packaging is another key component of Second Chance. Customers are able to view various types of Amazon packaging and are provided with instructions on how and where to dispose of the materials.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n33\\nProduct Donations\\nAt Amazon facilities around the world, we are continuously expanding initiatives to maximize the positive impact of our surplus inventory. We contribute food and non-food product donations to hundreds of food banks and nonprofits, reducing landfill waste and helping our local communities.\\nAmazon partners with Feeding America and Good360 to donate surplus inventory and distribute products to communities in need across the U.S. In 2019, Amazon and Whole Foods Market donated 37.5 million meals and 200,000 pounds (90,700 kilograms) of household essentials to Feeding America through its donation program.\\nThroughout countries in Europe, we collaborate with local food banks and non-food charities to donate products to communities in need. Amazon is a long-term partner of the German nonprofit Innatura, which brokers in-kind donations to charitable organizations. Through this partnership, Amazon has donated to more than 1,500 charities benefiting nearly 500,000 individuals and families in Germany with donations including toys, shoes, clothing, and drugstore items, among others.\\nAmazon works with In Kind Direct, a national charity in the UK that manages the donation of surplus products to charities across the country. Since partnering with In Kind Direct, we have donated more than $8.7 million (7 million) worth of products. In 2019 alone, we donated $1.2 million (1 million) to over 2,000 charities and voluntary organizations across the UK.\\nAmazon is also investing in automated systems that enable third-party sellers to donate their surplus inventory to local charities. This new program has quickly become popular, with 97% of sellers on Amazon in the U.S. opting to donate their surplus inventory. This program also launched in the UK with nine local charity partners and will expand to France by the end of 2020. In the last three months of 2019 alone, third-party sellers donated a combined 3 million products to communities in need through this new automated system.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n34\\nPackaging and Products\\nWe are redesigning packaging to reduce waste and making our private-label products\\nand devices in responsible ways.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n35\\nReducing Packaging Waste\\nOur customers want right-sized, recyclable packaging that minimizes waste and ensures damage-free delivery. We work to reinvent and simplify our sustainable packaging options using a science-based approach that combines lab testing, machine learning, materials science, and manufacturing partnerships to scale sustainable change across the packaging supply chain.\\nSustainable Packaging Initiatives\\nOur sustainable packaging initiatives reduce waste and make it easier for customers to remove products from packaging. Unlike traditional retail stores, products bought online don\\'t need the elaborate packaging used for displaying products on store shelves. Instead, customers use star ratings and reviews to guide their online shopping decisions.\\nOur Frustration-Free Packaging (FFP) program encourages manufacturers to package their products in easy-to-open packaging that is 100% recyclable and ready to ship to customers without additional Amazon boxes. Since 2015, we have reduced the weight of outbound packaging by 33% and eliminated more than 900,000 tons of packaging material, the equivalent of 1.6 billion shipping boxes.\\nTo certify products under Amazon\\'s FFP program, we help manufacturers innovate and improve their packaging functionality. By testing products in a dedicated, state-of-the-art lab in Seattle and in our fulfillment centers across the globe, we identify specific steps that manufacturers can take to\\nimprove their packaging and ensure products are protected all the way to the customer\\'s doorstep.\\nToday, more than 2 million products qualify under our FFP program. Philips, for example, was inspired by our FFP program to reinvent their packaging. The new Norelco OneBlade razor design now has 80% less packaging volume, is fully recyclable, and delights customers with print on the inside of the box which enhances the opening experience\\nMachine Learning\\nHow big of a box is needed for a given product? Is an Amazon box needed at all? To find out, we use machine learning algorithms to arrive at the best possible packaging choices for deliveries. That means identifying which products don\\'t need packaging at all, and which smaller products are suitable for envelopes or mailers. In cases where the protection of a box is needed, algorithms help us continuously optimize box choices to fit our ever-changing catalog. Computer-aided engineering also helps us redesign boxes to use less material while making sure customer orders are protected. These improvements\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n36\\nreduce volume per shipment, which means less unnecessary packaging and more efficient use of all forms of transportation, reducing carbon in small amounts to create a larger impact across our network.\\nWe also use machine learning to help target products where even small packaging improvements can have significant impacts on reducing waste. We developed a machine learning model to identify liquid products with the highest average rates of customer reported damages. We then subjected those products to extensive additional testing at our Amazon Packaging Lab, where we simulate a package\\'s journey from the manufacturer to the customer.\\nThrough this process, we\\'ve teamed up with companies like Rieke--a packaging solutions firm that makes dispensing systems for personal care, food, and healthcare products--to provide data and packaging insights on many of the conventional dispensing systems that are used in millions of products on Amazon. By strengthening materials, creating new locking mechanisms to prevent pumps from twisting open, and sealing potential leak points, Rieke\\'s team has created dispensers specially designed to withstand the journey to the customer. These new and improved designs include trigger sprayers common on household cleaners and personal care products, pumps for lotions, and pumps for foams.\\nEngaging with Vendors and Industry\\nWe work with top brands and vendors to reinvent their packaging for waste reduction in e-commerce, including optimized packaging that allow products to be shipped in their own container. The toy maker Hasbro, for example, redesigned the packaging for its popular toy, Baby Alive, reducing both the amount of material used and the overall package size by more than 50%. The pet food company Hill\\'s Pet Nutrition reworked its packaging to make bags of kibble less likely to break and spill during shipment; testing at Amazon validated the redesigned packaging.\\nWe are working across the packaging industry, using new analytics and test methods, new materials, and new ways to build enclosures that protect customer products. With packaging suppliers, for example, we have developed solutions for liquid dispensing systems on hard-to-ship items, such as household cleaners and personal care products, preventing spills and the need for extra packaging to contain spills if they happen.\\nAmazon is a member of the Sustainable Packaging Coalition (SPC), an industry working group dedicated to a more robust environmental vision for packaging. SPC uses strong member support, an informed and science-based approach, supply chain collaborations, and continuous outreach to design packaging that encourages a sustainable flow of materials. Amazon has also joined the International Safe Transit Association (ISTA), an organization focused on the specific concerns of transport packaging. ISTA is a nonprofit, member-driven association that sets the standards for optimizing the resources in packages that are designed to be survivable, sustainable, and successful.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n37\\nSustainable Products and Materials\\nAmazon aims to be Earth\\'s most customer-centric company, which means giving our customers access to the sustainable products they want. From thousands of Amazon-branded products to millions of retail and third-party items sold on Amazon, we are working to reduce the environmental impact of the products we manufacture and provide customers more information about the sustainability attributes associated with the items we sell.\\n\\nSustainable products cover a range of attributes intended to preserve the natural world, and we strive to help Amazon customers easily discover and shop products that exceed the environmental benefits of comparable products.\\nFor Amazon-owned Private Brand products and Amazon devices, we work with many of the manufacturers and suppliers that produce our private-label selection to drive sustainability improvements through materials and ingredients, design, sourcing, and manufacturing technology. Our global teams also work closely with suppliers to communicate our human rights standards, and help suppliers build their capacity to provide safe and respectful working environments.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n38\\nHousehold Goods\\nMany Amazon customers prioritize safety and sustainability when it comes to household goods like cleaning supplies and personal care products. Customers want to be sure the products they buy are safe for their families and help preserve the planet, without compromising on quality or price.\\nWe are working to increase the sustainable attributes of many of our Private Brand selections, from bio-based laundry and dish soaps that offer an effective, alternative choice to conventional formulas, to beauty products that are formulated without harmful chemicals. As part of that commitment, we implemented a Chemicals Policy and Restricted Substance List (RSL), both of which apply to Amazon-owned baby, household cleaning, personal care, and beauty brands. To support the broader retail sector\\'s collaborative effort to use safer formulations and produce more sustainable products, Amazon joined the Retail Leadership Council of the Green Chemistry and Commerce Council (GC3).\\nWe also take an active role in promoting sustainability with our selling partners. For example, we teamed up with Procter & Gamble to develop the Tide Eco-Box, a concentrated version of Tide\\'s traditional laundry detergent compressed into a fully recyclable, shipping-safe package, which is produced using 60% less plastic and 30% less water than a conventional plastic jug. Countless other Amazon selling partners offer biodegradable and plant-based options for staples like dish detergent and multi-purpose cleaners.\\nFood and Grocery\\nSustainable food selection means something different to each customer. Across our Amazon food and grocery businesses, we make it easy for customers to find a range of options like free range, pasture-fed, organic, and fair trade groceries.\\nAs sellers of animal-derived products, we recognize our responsibility to uphold animal welfare within our supply chain. We expect our suppliers to uphold the Five Freedoms framework for animal welfare, including freedom from hunger and thirst; freedom from discomfort; freedom from pain, injury, or disease; freedom to express normal behavior; and freedom from fear and distress. We expect our suppliers to comply with all applicable laws and to take a zero-tolerance approach to animal cruelty, abuse, and neglect. We encourage suppliers to continuously improve their animal welfare standards and practices, and to work towards recognized animal welfare certifications or industry guidelines that include welfare provisions.\\nAt Whole Foods Market in the U.S., we sell high quality natural and organic foods. We research ingredients and audit sourcing practices for Whole Foods Private Brand products to make shopping easier for customers. In our meat department, products are free of added hormones or antibiotics, and no cages or tethers are permitted during the animal\\'s daily life. Our seafood department sources only from responsibly managed fish farms and fisheries. The Whole Trade Guarantee found on produce and other items signifies that a product meets criteria that support both workers and the environment.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n39\\nPalm Oil\\nPalm oil is used extensively as an ingredient in consumer products. However, its cultivation has contributed to deforestation, biodiversity loss, and negative social impacts in some of the regions where it is grown. Our approach is to promote the use of sustainably-certified palm oil in our Private Brand food products and ask our Private Brand suppliers to source palm oil that is sustainably-certified. We are starting with Amazon-owned Private Brand food products in North America and across Europe, where our goal is to source 100% sustainable palm oil by the end of 2020.\\nChemicals\\nWe are committed to developing high-quality and affordable Amazon-owned Private Brand products that customers love. Part of our commitment to quality is avoiding chemicals of concern in our products that can affect human health and/or the environment. We define chemicals of concern as those chemicals that: (1) meet the criteria for classification as a carcinogen, mutagen, or reproductive or other systemic toxicant; or (2) are persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic. We strategically prioritize which chemicals of concern to focus on based on product type, customer concerns, and the availability of safer alternatives.\\nThe baseline list of chemicals of concern included on our first Restricted Substance List (RSL) identifies the chemicals that we seek to avoid in Amazon-owned Private Brand baby, household cleaning, personal care, and beauty products in the U.S. and Europe. This policy is in addition to applicable local legal requirements and associated compliance plans. It will be expanded to additional brands, product categories, and geographies over time. Read more about our chemicals policy. amzn.to/materials\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n40\\nFashion and Apparel\\nAt Amazon, we\\'re committed to making it easier for our customers to choose highquality, sustainable apparel products. We are working to lower the environmental impact of our Amazon-owned Private Brand apparel products and we partner directly with suppliers of these products to find solutions that promote the use of sustainably-produced fabrics and recycled materials. We are starting our work in the U.S. and Europe, and will expand to additional geographies over time. To incorporate industry best practices and support collective action, we are proud to collaborate with leading apparel partners, including the Better Cotton Initiative, Textile Exchange, Sustainable Apparel Coalition, and Leather Working Group.\\nCotton: We are working to ensure that all cotton used in Amazon-owned Private Brand apparel products is sourced sustainably by the end of 2022. This includes cotton sourced from recycled materials, or from farms certified as organic or licensed by the Better Cotton Initiative, a global nonprofit that aims to transform the cotton supply chain by developing Better Cotton as a sustainable mainstream commodity.\\nIn 2019, Amazon signed the Responsible Sourcing Network\\'s public Cotton Pledge, committing to not source cotton from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan until the pervasive use of government-mandated forced labor is stopped. Amazon prohibits forced labor within our supply chains, and we have internal controls and external engagements to address forced labor within global supply chains. This pledge represents an additional step in that direction and lends Amazon\\'s voice in demanding an end to forced labor in these two countries.\\nCellulosic fibers: By 2022, we will ensure that none of the man-made cellulosic fibers--including rayon/viscose, lyocell, and modal--sourced for Amazon-owned Private Brand apparel products are derived from ancient and endangered forests, or from endangered species\\' habitats or other controversial sources, as defined by the nonprofit organization Canopy\\'s tools and reports. Our approach to cellulosics includes using fabrics that provide assurance on traceability and use best available processing technology, as well as supporting the use of innovative lower impact alternative fiber sources, such as recycled fiber from used clothing.\\nRecycled fabrics: We will increase the use of recycled fabrics in Amazon-owned Private Brand apparel products, including moving from conventional to recycled polyester, and launching products made from innovative recycled fibers. In 2020, we joined the Textile Exchange, a global nonprofit that works with its members to drive industry transformation in preferred fibers, including recycled materials.\\nLeather: In 2020, we joined the Leather Working Group, a nonprofit membership organization that works to improve environmental stewardship within the global leather industry. By the end of 2023, we will source all leather used in Amazonowned Private Brand apparel and shoe products from tanneries that meet the Leather Working Group\\'s bronze level award or higher.\\nProduct labels: As of 2020, all new woven labels in Amazon-owned Private Brand apparel products are made from recycled fabric and all new swing tags are made from FSC-certified paper.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n41\\nDevices and Sustainability\\nAmazon aims to be Earth\\'s most customer-centric company, which means as part of Amazon\\'s commitment to The Climate Pledge, we are working to make Amazon devices more sustainable, from how we make them to how customers use them. We complete life cycle assessments to help us understand the environmental impact of each device type and use these learnings to set goals, from using recycled materials to investing in renewable energy. We are building a future in which customers will be able to control their smart homes or read, listen, and watch on their devices, knowing that Amazon is reducing its carbon footprint.\\n\\nRecycled Materials\\nWe are incorporating recycled plastics, fabrics, and metals into many new Amazon devices, giving new life to materials that could otherwise end up in waste streams. The recycled materials used in our devices launching in 2020 could fill over 800 garbage trucks worth of plastics, fabrics, and aluminum.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n42\\nDevice Packaging\\nWhen it comes to sustainability, we are not just focused on improving our devices, but on their packaging too. We are working to source 100% of the wood fiber in this packaging from responsibly managed forests or recycled sources. We\\'re reducing single-use plastic, eliminating over 9 million bags from our device packaging in 2020 alone. Our goal is to make Amazon devices packaging 100% curbside recyclable and plastic-free by 2023. We are also redesigning the shipping package to reduce waste.\\nEnergy\\nWe strive to make our devices energy efficient because it\\'s good for the planet and our customers. That\\'s why we\\'ve added a Low Power Mode feature to select devices that reduces their energy consumption during periods of inactivity over their lifetime. Making our devices more energy efficient is not enough to get to net zero carbon. So, starting in 2020, Amazon is building new wind and solar farms to produce clean energy equivalent to the electricity used by every customer\\'s Echo device. We have a bold goal to continue building new renewable energy projects until we account for the energy consumption of all Amazon devices.\\nInvesting in Clean Energy\\nAmazon works with energy companies to bring new renewable projects online to produce clean energy equivalent to the electricity used by our devices. To size these projects, we model and measure the energy consumed by our devices in different types of use, then project their total average global annual electricity consumption. The first new wind and solar farms are expected to come online in 2022 and 2023, and will produce clean energy equivalent to the electricity used by every customer\\'s Echo device. Until then, we will invest in renewable energy certificates to support clean energy projects, matching the quantity of electricity our customers\\' Echo devices use until the new projects come online. Our Amazon renewable energy portfolio is global, and in the coming years we will expand our devices renewable energy portfolio into other regions where our devices are used.\\nAlexa\\nCustomers can track and manage the energy consumed by compatible devices in their homes with an energy dashboard, coming soon to the Alexa app. Plus, if Alexa has a Hunch that a customer is away and forgot to turn off a light, Alexa will automatically turn it off -- helping customers conserve energy without even thinking about it. Collectively, this can help save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\\nTrade In or Recycle\\nWe build our devices to last, but there may come a time when customers want to trade in or recycle their device. Customers in the U.S. can explore their options with Amazon Second Chance. Eligible devices qualify for an Amazon.com Gift Card equal to the value of the trade-in, plus a discount toward the purchase of a new eligible Amazon device. For devices that are not eligible for trade-in, we offer customers a recycling program for electronic items including Amazon devices and accessories.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n43\\nThe Cloud\\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is committed to running our business in the most\\nenvironmentally friendly way possible and achieving 100% renewable energy usage for our\\nglobal infrastructure.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n44\\nLearn how AWS is working to achieve Amazon\\'s goal of 100% renewable energy.\\n\\nJAN 2016\\n\\nAPR 2015\\n\\nAmazon announces joining the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) and will participate in the U.S. Partnership for Renewable Energy Finance (U.S. PREF) to increase our work with state and federal policymakers and other stakeholders to enable more renewable energy opportunities for cloud providers.\\n2014\\n\\nNOV 2015\\n\\nJUL 2015\\n\\nAWS announces that it has contracted with Iberdrola Renewables, LLC to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm U.S. East.\\nAWS announces that it has contracted with EDP Renewables to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm U.S. Central.\\n\\nJUN 2016\\n\\nAmazon launches Wind Farm Fowler Ridge, marking the first of our four announced renewable energy projects to move into full operation.\\n\\nAWS and Dominion Virginia Power join forces on a landmark renewable energy delivery deal.

In addition to our efforts on energy efficiency and our goal to achieve 100% renewable energy for our global infrastructure, AWS has multiple initiatives to improve our water use efficiency and reduce the use of potable (drinking) water for cooling data centers.\\nAWS develops our water use strategy by evaluating climate patterns for each AWS Region, local water management and availability, and the opportunity to conserve drinking water sources. Taking a holistic approach, we assess both the water and energy usage of each potential cooling solution to select the most efficient method.\\nEvaporative Cooling\\nWhen possible, AWS incorporates direct evaporative technology for cooling our data centers, significantly reducing energy and water consumption. During cooler months, outside air is directly supplied to the data center without using any water. During the hottest months of the year, outside air is cooled through an evaporative process using water before being pushed into the server rooms, and we have optimized our cooling systems to use minimal water. AWS is constantly innovating the design of our cooling systems to further reduce water use, and we utilize real-time sensor data to adapt to changing weather conditions.\\nRecycled Water\\nAWS is expanding its use of non-potable water for cooling purposes to help conserve local drinking water sources. In Northern Virginia, AWS was the first data center operator to be approved to use recycled water with direct evaporative cooling technology. We partnered with Loudoun Water to demonstrate the benefits of recycled water for industrial cooling applications, and shared our operational best practices for utilizing recycled water in our data centers. In the AWS U.S. West (Oregon) Region, we have partnered with a local utility to use non-potable water for multiple data centers, and we are retrofitting AWS data centers in Northern California to use recycled water.\\nThe process for utilizing recycled water begins when wastewater from residential and industrial customers is treated at a local facility and redistributed through its own piping infrastructure. Recycled water has to meet stringent health standards and safe surface discharge standards.\\nAWS is working with local utilities to expand distribution infrastructure and drive faster implementation and adoption of recycled water for data center cooling applications, in order to reduce our usage of potable water.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n48\\nOn-Site Water Treatment\\nAWS is implementing on-site modular water treatment systems in multiple regions. As water is cycled through evaporative cooling units, minerals build up as water evaporates, eventually reaching a level of concentration that requires replacement with fresh water. On-site water treatment allows us to remove scale-forming minerals and reuse water for more cycles. Increasing our \"cycles of concentration\" allows us to continue to reduce water intake for cooling our data centers.\\nWater Efficiency Metrics\\nIn the infrastructure regions where we use water for cooling, AWS has developed water efficiency metrics to determine and monitor optimal water use for each AWS Region, and we employ a data-driven approach to select the most effective water reduction technologies. Water metrics from each of our Regions help AWS evaluate technologies and understand the long-term impacts on our water usage, in order to increase efficiency as our infrastructure grows and we expand to new regions.\\nWe are partnering with utilities to connect directly to utility water meters, and we are also installing our own meters to track real-time water usage to provide consistent data for our operations and sustainability teams. By analyzing this data, AWS can identify opportunities to reduce water usage and rapidly make operational changes, rather than waiting for bills or usage reports.\\nAWS will continue to implement these strategies and test new technologies in order to reduce our water consumption and conserve potable water sources. Saving water is good for the environment and also benefits our customers as we increase our operational efficiency.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n49\\nAmazon Sustainability Data Initiative\\nThe Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) seeks to accelerate sustainability research and innovation by minimizing the cost and time required to acquire and analyze large sustainability datasets.\\nASDI currently works with scientific organizations like NOAA, NASA, the UK Met Office and Government of Queensland to identify, host, and deploy key datasets on the AWS Cloud, including weather observations, weather forecasts, climate projection data, satellite imagery, hydrological data, air quality data, and ocean forecast data. These datasets are publicly available to anyone. In addition, ASDI provides cloud grants to those interested in exploring the use of AWS\\' technology and scalable infrastructure to solve big, long-term sustainability challenges with this data. The dual-pronged approach allows sustainability researchers to analyze massive amounts of data in mere minutes, regardless of where they are in the world or how much local storage space or computing capacity they can access.\\nInnovating for Sustainability in the Cloud\\nFrom university researchers to local governments, federal agencies to private startups, many organizations are leveraging ASDI to better understand the long-term opportunities to address big challenges like climate change. Below are some examples of how AWS customers are innovating and problem solving for sustainability.\\n Satellite imagery for five countries in Africa has been compiled in the African Regional Data Cube (managed by the UN Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data), a tool developed in the AWS Cloud that enables authorities in countries like Ghana, Sierra Leone and Senegal to monitor deforestation, illegal mining and manage coastal erosion.\\n In Virginia, flood-prone towns are using sensors to monitor water levels and upload them to the AWS cloud as part of the StormSense project. Local residents can ask Alexa about water levels in specific places or subscribe to an app with alerts on dangerous flooding. \"The only way you can scale this well is by being in the cloud,\" said Sridhar Katragadda, data officer for the City of Virginia Beach, which is participating in the project.\\n Projects like Temperate and CalAdapt are also providing cloud-based tools to help communities better understand and prepare for climate change. These projects leverage large datasets staged on AWS to evaluate future climate changes and how those changesmay impact people, assets, and operations.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n50\\n The BlueDot Observatory is using open satellite Earth Observations on AWS to monitor closely at-risk inland water bodies. The tool hopes to raise awareness about the vulnerability of these water resources and to provide timely insights that inform water management efforts.\\n Some work that ASDI is enabling is more foundational and is expanding our knowledge and understanding of key processes. For example, a group of researchers at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the American Bird Conservancy published some exciting understandings about bird migration patterns based on NOAA\\'s NEXRAD weather data that is freely available on AWS.\\nASDI supports innovators and researchers with the data, tools, and technical expertise they need to move sustainability to the next level.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n51\\nPeople\\n53 Human Rights 60 Employees 73 Supply Chain 85 Community\\nHuman Rights\\nAmazon is committed to ensuring the people and communities that support our entire value chain are treated with fundamental dignity and respect, and we strive to ensure the products and services we provide are produced in a way that respects\\ninternationally recognized human rights.\\n!\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n53\\nOur Approach to Human Rights\\nOur approach is informed by international standards: we respect and support the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Core Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.\\nOur human rights strategy has four pillars:\\n1 Strong Policies\\nOur efforts are anchored in policies that apply across all aspects of our business--from our own operations, to our supply chain, to the communities in which we operate. In 2019, we codified our commitment to human rights in Amazon\\'s Global Human Rights Principles, which underline the importance we place on embedding respect for human rights throughout our business.\\n Human Rights Principles From the associates in our fulfillment centers, to the drivers delivering packages to our customers, to the factory workers making the products we sell--people are critical to our mission of being earth\\'s most customer-centric company. These values have been long-held at Amazon and codifying them into a set of Human Rights Principles demonstrates our support for fundamental human rights and the dignity of workers everywhere we operate around the world.\\n Supply Chain Standards We set a high bar for ourselves and our suppliers. Our Supply Chain Standards detail the requirements and expectations for suppliers in our supply chain and are grounded in principles of inclusivity, continuous improvement, and supply chain accountability. We engage with suppliers that are committed to these same principles; suppliers commit to these standards as a condition of doing business with us.\\nWe are committed to consistently evolving and improving our approach. We continuously review our policies and, at least every other year, conduct an in-depth benchmarking of our policies against international standards and evolving industry best practices to identify areas for update and improvement.\\n2 Embedding Human Rights Into Our Business\\nIn order to prevent and mitigate adverse impacts in the long run, we are committed to embedding human rights considerations into decision-making across the company and into our policy and governance framework. This governance starts with the Amazon Board of Directors, which appoints committees for oversight on specific issues. Among other duties, its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees Amazon\\'s global environmental, corporate social responsibility, and corporate governance policies and initiatives, and its Leadership Development and Compensation Committee oversees Amazon\\'s global human capital management strategies and policies.\\nWe are also building an employee training and engagement program to raise awareness of important human rights topics across the company. For example, in 2019, we launched training on human trafficking and forced labor for employees in our logistics network--educating our employees on how to recognize the warning signs of this criminal behavior.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n54\\nHuman Trafficking Awareness\\nAmazon does not tolerate the use of child labor, forced labor, or human trafficking in any form--including slave labor, prison labor, indentured servitude, or bonded labor--in our operations or value chain. We have detailed the components of this commitment to combating human trafficking (also referred to as \"modern slavery\") in our annual Modern Slavery Statement, our Supply Chain Standards, and our Global Human Rights Principles.\\nWe\\'re raising awareness through employee training and partnerships. As a global retail and technology company employing hundreds of thousands of workers around the world, we recognize the responsibility and opportunity we have to raise awareness among our employees through education and training on relevant human rights and social responsibility issues. In 2019, we launched a human trafficking awareness program for employees around the world. In the program\\'s first phase, we trained fulfillment network managers in our UK operations. In 2020, we expanded this training to teach employees across our entire global fulfillment network to recognize signs of modern slavery using localized scenarios.\\nThe training focuses on raising awareness and teaching employees how to identify indicators of modern slavery and report concerns to appropriate authorities in a way that puts the interests of victims first. To develop the training, we relied on input from organizations with expertise in modern slavery, including Verit, a recognized leader in global labor protections, and incorporated videos and materials from the Gangmasters and Labor Abuse Authority (GLAA), a UK public agency focused on investigating labor exploitation. In 2020, we expanded our English training module to cover more languages and are developing region-specific training for our global employees. Our global security operations team has immediate response protocols in the event of a suspected human trafficking related issue, regardless of where the issue arises.\\nIn October 2019, we became an official corporate sponsor of Truckers Against Trafficking (TAT), an organization dedicated to combating human trafficking in the trucking industry, and began incorporating TAT training modules into trainings for our internal fleet of drivers to teach them how to identify and respond to potential victims of human trafficking. Our goal is to train 100% of our internal fleet of drivers on the Truckers Against Trafficking curriculum by the end of 2020.\\nOur social responsibility team regularly reviews and updates Amazon\\'s approach to human trafficking prevention and updates executive leadership on our progress throughout the year.\\n\\n3 Transparency and Stakeholder Engagement\\nWe are committed to driving industry-wide best practices in human rights due diligence through increased disclosures about our approach and expanding our stakeholder engagement.\\nIn 2019, we published our first interactive supplier map that provides details on suppliers of Amazon-branded apparel, consumer electronics, and home goods products. We expanded the map in 2020 to include additional suppliers and product categories, and to include information on capacity building programs completed by individual suppliers. In 2020, we disclosed additional information about our supplier assessment process and audit results, about our approach to worker engagement, and about the goals we have set for ourselves on such topics as forced labor training and women\\'s empowerment. To continue to expand our disclosures and transparency on these issues, we report against the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights Reporting Framework.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n55\\nEngagement with external stakeholders is key to our human rights due diligence approach. We rely on experts and affected rights holders to inform our approach and ensure our efforts have the intended impact. In the last year, we have built new relationships with: the Better Buying Initiative to promote improved purchasing practices, Nest to improve conditions in the handworker economy, the Amader Kotha Worker Helpline to provide access to grievance for workers in the Bangladesh garment sector, Truckers Against Trafficking to train our drivers on how to identify victims of human trafficking, and Unseen to support the UK Modern Slavery Helpline and Resource Centre. Through these partnerships we access invaluable expert input to our work, helping us achieve greater impact on working conditions around the world.\\n4 Mechanisms to Address Risk\\nWe are committed to identifying, preventing, and mitigating adverse human rights impacts, and are continuously working to improve our approach.\\nIn our supply chain, we assess and respond to risk by leveraging internal and external data, and guidance from external stakeholders including industry experts, civil society groups, and non-governmental organizations. We use independent auditors to verify compliance with our Supply Chain Standards though regular on-site inspections and confidential worker interviews. We also recognize that audits alone are insufficient to drive long-term change across industries. We are exploring new ways to encourage improvement in worker protections, including supplier capacity building programs, worker trainings, and collaborations with other brands and civil society.\\nWithin our own operations, we have teams dedicated to assessing and addressing risk to our employees. Those teams focus on employee engagement--establishing open communication with our employees around the world and providing them with meaningful grievance mechanisms and avenues for dialogue with leadership. We are dedicated to building a diverse and inclusive workplace, where every employee feels comfortable sharing their unique perspectives and is supported in growing their career. And, we are obsessed with keeping our employees safe while on the job. We are working relentlessly to innovate and create new industry benchmarks for health and safety.\\nWe know we have more to do--we are committed to continuously widening our lens to better understand the potential human rights impacts of our business. In 2020, we are partnering with sustainability and human rights consulting firm Article One Advisors to identify salient human rights risks across our business. The UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework recommends this systematic review of risks as a way to prioritize a company\\'s work on human rights. The results will help us prioritize and design human rights impact assessments--deep dives on specific products, regions, or risk areas, which we will communicate to customers and stakeholders.\\nOUR GOALS: Launch a review of Amazon\\'s salient human rights risks by the end of 2020. Execute our first human rights impact assessment by the end of 2020.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n56\\nAmazon Global Human Rights Principles\\nWe are committed to ensuring the people, workers, and communities that support our entire value chain are treated with fundamental dignity and respect. We strive to ensure that the products and services we provide are produced in a way that respects human rights.\\nWhile it is the duty of governments to protect human rights, Amazon recognizes our responsibility to respect and uphold internationally recognized human rights through the ethical treatment of our workforce and those within our value chain. Guided by the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we commit to embedding respect for human rights throughout our business. We continuously evaluate our operations and value chain to identify, assess, and address salient human rights risks; engage key stakeholders; and prioritize key areas where we have the greatest opportunity to have a positive impact on workers and communities. Our approach on human rights is informed by international standards; we respect and support the Core Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\\nWe are committed to investing in our employees, the workers who make our products, and the communities in which we operate. These principles outline our approach to human rights across all aspects of our company.\\nOur Workplace\\nWe endeavor to provide safe, inclusive, and respectful workplaces, in both our own operations and those throughout our value chain.\\nSafe and Healthy Workplaces: We strive to be the most safety-centric organization in the world. We provide a clean, safe, and healthy work environment. The health, wellness, and safety of our workers is our number one priority. Everyone has the right to a safe and healthy workplace with appropriate rules and practices for reporting and preventing accidents, injuries, and unsafe conditions, procedures, or behaviors.\\nDiversity and Inclusion: We are committed to diversity and inclusion throughout our business. We seek individuals from all backgrounds to join our teams, and we encourage people to bring their authentic, original, and best selves to work.\\nEqual Opportunity: We are committed to ensuring that all workers are treated equally, and we do not tolerate discrimination based on race, color, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, creed, the presence of any physical, sensory, or mental disabilities, age, political ideology, pregnancy, citizenship, migrant status, veteran status, ethnicity, ancestry, caste, marital or family status, or other legally protected status in hiring and working practices, such as job applications, promotions, job assignments, training, wages, benefits, and termination. Our aim is to ensure employment decisions and actions are based only on business-\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n57\\nrelated considerations--focused solely on an individual\\'s ability to perform the work, not their personal characteristics. As outlined in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, we do not tolerate discrimination, violent and threatening behavior, or harassment.\\nFreely Chosen Employment: We do not tolerate the use of child labor, forced labor, or human trafficking in any form--including slave labor, prison labor, indentured servitude, or bonded labor--in our operations or value chain.\\nEmployee Communication: We value worker feedback. We firmly believe it is in our employees\\' and the company\\'s best interests to continue our direct communications, and the best way to effect positive change is for our employees to continue working directly with their managers throughout the company. We respect freedom of association and our employees\\' right to join, form, or not to join a labor union or other lawful organization of their own selection, without fear of reprisal, intimidation, or harassment. We provide training to employees on topics covered within the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, including how to submit anonymous complaints to Amazon\\'s third-party Ethics Hotline. We are committed to providing our employees with appropriate access to grievance mechanisms and remedial action.\\nOur Suppliers\\nWe promote safe, inclusive, and respectful workplaces with our third-party suppliers and service providers. We seek suppliers committed to these same principles. Amazon\\'s Supply Chain Standards set forth requirements governing labor standards and working conditions. We implement this commitment through dedicated programs that communicate our expectations to the third-parties we work with, monitor working conditions where Amazon-branded products are made or services provided, implement plans to address issues and make improvements where necessary, and engage with stakeholders working to address specific and systemic issues.\\nHow We Do This\\nIntegration Throughout our Business: We expect and encourage everyone in our business to embed these principles into their everyday work and provide employee training to raise awareness on them. We strive to evaluate and understand the impact of each part of our business on human rights, to address and mitigate negative impacts, and to invest in the people behind the products and services we provide.\\nContinuous Improvement: To ensure we are continuing to hold the highest standards, we continuously review our policies and practices to ensure alignment with these principles and regularly provide updates on progress to senior leadership.\\nCollaboration: In support of these efforts, we value ongoing collaboration with a broad range of stakeholders, helping us remain vigilant and aware of the potential impacts--both positive and negative--of our products and services on the rights, interests, and well-being of our employees, customers, and communities around the world.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n58\\nOur Business\\nAmazon seeks to be Earth\\'s most customer-centric company. We are passionate builders guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. We bring these principles to everything we do, including how we approach human rights.\\nOur Operations: Amazon believes the people, workers, and communities who support our business should be treated with fundamental dignity and respect. As of July 2020, we employed approximately 876,800 full-time and part-time workers across the globe. We manage our operations, including the people working in them, in three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Our online and physical stores enable hundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties. We source, manufacture, sell, and deliver millions of products to consumers.\\nOur Products: Amazon Consumer Private Brands and Amazon Devices offer our customers products spanning diverse categories including apparel, food and beverage, electronics, and home goods. Amazon\\'s suppliers are located around the world and produce, manufacture, assemble, or provide goods or services that are sold and delivered to Amazon.\\nThird-Party Sellers: Third parties sell products directly to customers on Amazon.com spanning broad product categories. These orders are either fulfilled by Amazon using our operations or shipped directly by the seller to the customer.\\nFulfillment and Logistics: More than 250,000 full-time associates support our global network of fulfillment centers. Amazon Fulfillment is where our employees, technology, and innovation come together every day to deliver for our customers. Fulfillment facilities run multiple shifts per day, and employees perform a number of roles--from leading teams to boxing up orders and shipping directly to our customers. We fulfill customer orders in a number of ways using our transportation supply chain. We operate North America and International fulfillment and delivery networks and have co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries. We also provide digital delivery and offer products in our physical stores as well.\\nAWS: AWS offers over 175 fully featured services from data centers globally. Ours is the largest global infrastructure footprint of any provider, and this footprint is constantly increasing. AWS teams around the world are building the future. Our people solve a wide variety of technical challenges, always focusing on the customer. Millions of customers-- including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies--trust AWS to power their technology infrastructure. aws.amazon.com\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n59\\nEmployees\\nFrom our software engineers, to the associates in our fulfillment centers, to the drivers delivering packages\\nto our customers--our employees are critical to our mission of being Earth\\'s most customer-centric\\ncompany. Our ranks are full of smart, passionate people who are building new products and services\\nevery day on behalf of our customers.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n60\\nWorkplace Health and Safety\\nSafety is a top priority throughout our fulfillment operations and on the roads in communities where we operate. Our vision is to synthesize leading health and safety expertise with Amazon\\'s tech capabilities and relentless innovation to create new industry benchmarks for the health and safety of our employees. Leaders in our facilities set the example for the highest safety standards.\\nFrom coaching and ergonomic training to ensuring processes and equipment in work areas are safely operated, leaders proactively verify and validate that safety protocols are followed. The industry-leading safety technology we use every day is designed to protect and promote our employees\\' health, and we consistently test and refine processes to improve working conditions in our facilities.\\nAbove all, safety at Amazon is about our people and partners. In 2019, we provided more than one million hours of safety training to employees. To make it all happen, we employ one of the largest health and safety organizations on the planet, with approximately 5,000 people worldwide focused on safety. Safety, however, is the responsibility of each and every person working at Amazon. In Amazon\\'s dynamic, positive safety culture, every team is engaged and encouraged to look out for one another.\\nSome of Amazon\\'s recent investments and technologies that support employees and make our workplaces safer include:\\nSafety Leadership Index (SLI): Amazon employees across the world are routinely surveyed through our innovative Connections program. Employees are asked the same series of questions each month, and those answers are used to measure employees\\' perception of safety at each of our facilities. An example of the kinds of questions which are asked include, \"Does your manager care about the safety of you and your team?\" Amazon employees have provided thousands of safety ideas, concerns, and suggestions since the program started, and Amazon has implemented more than 600 changes as a result of these responses. Last year, thanks to SLI feedback, we made personal safety equipment more easily available through free vending machines placed in fulfillment centers in several U.S. locations. Thanks to this improvement, employees can now get new equipment any time they want, which enhances safety for everyone.\\nWorkingWell: Over the past two years, we\\'ve developed WorkingWell, a program that uses academic research and certified athletic trainers to educate employees and leaders about health and wellness. WorkingWell is a training and conditioning program designed for new hires and tenured employees, which includes a new hire ramp-up schedule aimed at preventing musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). It also includes a two-week classroom course about proper body movements, health, and wellness, as well as routine safety training engagements.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n61\\nMind and Body Moments: Piloted in 2019, this new program employs 30-second, guided physical and mental exercises, offered directly at an employee\\'s workstation. The intent of these \"moments\" is to help reduce muscle fatigue and stress, thereby promoting wellness and mitigating injury risks. Employees at pilot sites have reported statistically significant reductions in discomfort. We\\'ve seen a nearly 13% improvement in employees who report no discomfort at all during their workday. We will continue to evaluate expansion of this program to other site types and countries, targeting the rest of North American and European facilities with expanded language offerings.\\nSafety Capital Investments: Our facilities are purposefully designed to incorporate innovative technologies that enhance safety and improve efficiency. We don\\'t stop there. In 2020, we are making a substantial investment in the safety of our people and facilities, with $296 million earmarked for safety-related programs in the U.S. alone. As examples of past investments, in 2019, we invested $14 million to further improve the safety of employee parking lots at our facilities; $9 million to retrofit pallet racking with state-of-the art equipment; and $1.6 million on pedestrian safety controls in some of our specialized distribution centers.\\nPowered Industrial Truck Technology: Powered Industrial Trucks (PIT) are an important part of any warehousing operation. Our goal of eliminating PIT incidents can only be met if we take a leadership role in innovating in this industry and developing technologies not currently available in the market. We are partnering with vendors and investing $66.5 million to pilot PIT units that incorporate real time location systems (RTLS) and light detection and ranging technology (LiDAR). Additionally, we are augmenting telemetry controls on PITs we already own, which allows us to better monitor and control speeds in congested areas, implement access control, and ensure only certified operators are able to activate PITs.\\nRobotic Tech Vest: Several reports of near misses at our robotic sites, involving objects inadvertently falling into the path of drive units, led us to invest $9.8 million into engineering controls that could significantly reduce these types of risk. These controls were implemented before any human injury occurred, which speaks to how seriously we take near misses and how we\\'re constantly looking to improve safety. One example of such investment is the Robotic Tech Vests worn by employees at Amazon Robotics facilities, which allow robotic drive units to detect employees and plan alternative travel paths to avoid interactions.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n62\\nInvestments in Our Employees\\nWe know that a strong culture and active investment in our people allows us to attract the diverse, innovative employees we need to understand and exceed our customers\\' expectations today and into the future. We are committed to providing the support, benefits, and opportunities our employees need to be successful, whether they are building their careers at Amazon or building skills with us to help them on their career journey.\\n876,800 full-time and part-time employees globally as of July 2020.\\n$15 per hour minimum wage for 100% of full-time, part-time, and temporary U.S. employees\\nComprehensive benefits from day one for 100% of full-time employees.\\nUp to 20 weeks paid parental leave.\\n24-hour a day free confidential counseling services.\\nOver 90% of Amazon regular full-time and part-time employees in the U.S. are eligible for healthcare benefits.\\nMore than 30,000 veterans and military spouses employed by the company, surpassing our goal of 25,000 by 2021.\\nUpskilling 2025 commitment: a $700 million commitment to pilot, launch, and scale training programs for 100,000 Amazonians by 2025.\\nOver the last decade, no other U.S.-based company has created more jobs than Amazon. Our investments have led to the creation of over 2 million direct and indirect jobs in the U.S. alone.\\nFor example, in the U.S., Amazon\\'s minimum wage begins at $15 an hour (in the UK at 9.50 GBP per hour and in Canada at 16 CAD per hour) for all full-time, part-time, temporary (including those hired by agencies), and seasonal employees. In addition to our $15 minimum wage, we offer full-time employees industry-leading benefits starting on their first day of employment with Amazon. These include: comprehensive healthcare coverage with affordable premiums (paycheck contributions) that extend to eligible family members, including medical, prescription drug, dental, and vision coverage; a 401(k) with a 50% match up to 4% of compensation; a Flexible Spending Account for health and dependent care; 24-hour a day free and confidential counseling services; and paid time off and holiday overtime pay. In 2020, Amazon is collaborating with Crossover Health to establish convenient health centers in the communities where our fulfillment centers and operations facilities are located, starting in Texas, with additional centers planned for other states in the months ahead.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n63\\nWe are proud to offer generous, flexible paid leave for all parents--from our most senior executives to our hourly employees, including parents of all genders and adoptive parents. Birth mothers get up to 20 weeks of paid leave and non-birth parents have access to six weeks paid leave. We also offer Leave Share--an innovative program that allows Amazonians to share their parental leave with a partner whose employer does not provide paid parental leave. Additionally, Ramp Back enables employees to return to work on a flexible schedule for up to eight weeks after birth or adoption. Where possible we provide unlimited gender transition benefits, including gender affirmation. We have internal resources to help managers and team members support employees who are going through a gender transition.\\nFor employees reaching their one-year employment mark, we offer our innovative Career Choice Program, which prepays 95% of tuition for courses in high-demand fields. Since the program\\'s launch eight years ago, more than 40,000 employees in 14 countries have pursued degrees in five broad fields of study: IT, Healthcare, Advanced Manufacturing and Skilled Trades, Administration and Business Services, and Transportation. We are also now offering graduate-school-level training for our employees through Machine Learning University, a program designed to give current Amazon employees the chance to develop expertise in machine learning, critical skills in an area of rapidly growing professional opportunities within and outside of Amazon.\\n\\nAdditional employee benefits include:\\n\\nA free employee assistance program, which provides confidential 24/7 support, resources, and referrals for different aspects of work and personal life.\\n\\nOnline resources for parents whose children experience developmental disabilities, as well as help finding child and elder care referrals and assistance.\\n\\nFinancial counseling, estate planning, and other services in the event of a lifethreatening illness or death.\\n\\nAdoption assistance for qualified domestic and international adoption expenses including attorney fees, court costs, and travel.\\n\\nCompany-paid basic life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, with the option to enroll in additional coverage for dependents.\\n\\nAdoption benefits, including reimbursement for parents of up to $5,000 per child associated with the domestic or international adoption of a child.\\n\\nFertility treatment coverage.\\n\\nCompany-paid short-term and long-term disability.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n64\\nDiversity and Inclusion\\nOur customers represent diversity in many forms--and we serve them better with a diverse and inclusive team. Our diverse perspectives help us push each other to think bigger, and differently, about the products and services we build for our customers and the day-to-day nature of our workplace.\\nWe want our employees and the communities we operate in to embrace that we are all human, we are all different, and we are all equal. Coming into work, every Amazonian should feel comfortable sharing their unique perspectives and seeking out the perspectives of others--this is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and constantly earn others\\' trust.\\nOur Workforce Data\\n\\nData reflects metrics as of December 31, 2019. Among Amazon\\'s global employees, 42.7% identify as women and 57.3% identify as men. Among managers globally, 27.5% identify as women and 72.5% identify as men. In the U.S., 15.4% of Amazon employees identify as Asian, 26.5% as Black/African American, 18.5% as Hispanic/Latinx, 1.3% as Native American, 3.6% as two or more races, and 34.7% as White. Among managers in the U.S., 20.8% identify as Asian, 8.3% as Black/African American, 8.1% as Hispanic/Latinx, 0.6% as Native American, 3.0% as two or more races, and 59.3% as White.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n65\\nGender Pay Gap A review of the compensation awarded in 2019 at Amazon, including both base and stock, shows that women earned 99.3 cents for every dollar that men earned performing the same jobs, and minorities earned 99.1 cents for every dollar that white employees earned performing these same jobs. We continue to prioritize pay equity.\\nDiversity\\nWe recognize we have room for improvement and we are not yet where we need to be. Increasing diversity in our workforce is a collective challenge that requires a team effort; it calls for both near- and long-term strategies:\\nBuilding an Inclusive Culture To better understand what inclusion means for our employees, we conducted a global internal survey which led to Amazon\\'s definition of inclusion: \"Being valued, trusted, connected, and informed so that we can deliver the best results for our customers.\" We use this definition to guide us as we create educational initiatives, continually improve our mentorship program, and deliver benefits for all of our employees. Amazon has 12 affinity groups created and led by employees-- comprised of over 50,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally--who passionately and positively impact our company, each with an executive sponsor that ensures these groups are engaging at every level of the company. Groups such as Amazon People with Disabilities, Amazon Women in Engineering, the Black Employees Network, and Glamazon (for LGBTQIA+ employees and their allies) lead in community-building, mentorship, and programs to build awareness around customer inclusion. We engage and consult their leaders and seek their ideas to improve our inclusion efforts internally and externally. Our efforts have received external recognition: we are proud to have been recognized on the NAACP Equity, Inclusion, and Empowerment Index and the Disability Equality Index.\\nDeveloping the Pipeline and Hiring the Best Talent We recognize there is a diversity problem in tech. We are investing in solving this in our own company as well as building out the next generation of technical talent for the industry and expanding the opportunities for students from underrepresented backgrounds. Our efforts focus on two goals. First, contribute to changing the talent pipeline long-term. Last year we announced Amazon Future Engineer, a childhood to career program that will inspire and teach more than 10 million underprivileged and underrepresented students each year about computer science. And in 2017, we committed $50 million over five years to STEM programs for diverse communities. Second, we want to immediately accelerate this change. To find the best talent now for technical and non-technical roles, we actively partner with organizations and academic institutions that reach underrepresented communities like Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), and women\\'s colleges. In addition, we\\'ve created nontraditional learning pathways, like the Amazon Veteran Technical Apprenticeship, which places transitioning members of the military into apprenticeships at Amazon with the intent to later hire them with the technical skills needed for a fulltime role.\\nObsessing Over Customer Inclusion Amazon\\'s focus on accessibility has made shopping and other daily experiences simpler for people with disabilities. From voice technology to Frustration-Free Packaging, Amazon\\'s customer obsession for accessibility was recognized with the 2019 American Foundation for the Blind Helen Keller Achievement Award.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n66\\nRacial Justice and Equity The inequitable and brutal treatment of Black and African Americans is unacceptable. Black lives matter and Amazon stands in solidarity with our Black employees, customers, and partners. We are committed to helping build a country and a world where everyone can live with dignity and free from fear. We support the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. We also support policies that protect and expand voting rights, as well as initiatives that provide better health and educational outcomes for Black people. As a part of that effort, Amazon and our employees--through a donation match program--were able to donate more than $27 million to organizations working to bring about social justice and improve the lives of Black and African Americans. Recipients--selected with the help of Amazon\\'s Black Employee Network (BEN)--include groups focused on combating systemic racism through the legal system as well as those dedicated to expanding educational and economic opportunities for Black communities. BEN will also receive a grant to fund local organizations that support education and racial equity initiatives in communities across the country where our employees live and work. We plan to continue building our relationships with these organizations and supporting movements for racial equity around the world. Amazon is committed to being part of the strategies, solutions, and partnerships that will enable long-term, sustainable change.\\nLGBTQIA+ Rights The rights of LGBTQIA+ people must be protected. We were early and strong supporters of marriage equality and will continue to advocate for protections and equal rights for transgender people. We stand together with the LGBTQIA+ community and are working at the U.S. federal and state levels on legislation, including supporting passage of the Equality Act. Amazon provides gender transition benefits based on the Standards of Care published by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). Amazon has held gender identity conferences since 2018 to build community, educate to those outside of the LGBTQIA+ community, and provide professional development opportunities for those at Amazon while transitioning openly in the workplace. In 2017, Amazon released our Transgender Toolkit for Trans/NB identifying employees at Amazon and we provide trans-inclusive medical benefits for Amazon employees. We are proud to have our efforts recognized, scoring 100% on the Human Rights Campaign\\'s Corporate Equality Index for LGBTQIA+ rights for the last three years.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n67\\nDiversity Conferences\\nBuilding on our Leadership Principle of Learn and Be Curious, we organize conferences every year where employees can learn and exchange their ideas and experiences, several focused specifically on diversity issues:\\nAmazeCon is our largest internal conference at Amazon and has highlighted the benefits of gender diversity since 2015. At AmazeCon, Amazonians examine the intersection of gender with race, sexual orientation, disability status, veteran status, and other dimensions of diversity. This conference has included talks from external leaders in technology, entrepreneurship, entertainment, and leadership. It also includes Amazon-specific programs focused on personal and team development.\\nAmazeWIT is a conference we host in India bringing together women technologists, including Amazon\\'s technical leaders and external guests. The day-long event focuses on technology deep dives (including voice technology, machine learning, Fire OS, and others) and leadership discussions from senior Amazonians and peer companies.\\nConversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) is our internal conference that explores how race impacts our daily lives. Launched in 2018, the conference leads Amazonians through content on historical context, productive conversations, being an ally, and customer inclusion. At CORE, external scholars, activists, and writers dive deep on topics to educate Amazonians from all backgrounds on the experiences people of color have in the workplace, and how to create supportive and inclusive teams.\\nGlobal Accessibility Awareness Month has been recognized each May at Amazon since 2015. Around the world, the month is full of events, technical talks, experiential trainings, podcasts, and workshops that showcase accessibility best practices. Amazonians take time throughout the month to learn about accessibility, even if it is not a part of their day-to-day work. In 2018, participants attended events across 13 locations in six countries. In 2018, Amazon also hosted the first A11yCon, a conference focused on increasing visibility and awareness to accessibility challenges. The conference also included a multi-location accessibility hackathon focused on finding solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing people with disabilities in today\\'s technology-focused world.\\nLearn more about our efforts to promote diversity and inclusion at Amazon.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n68\\nEmployee Engagement\\nOur more than 870,000 employees globally are the foundation of our success as a company. Consistent, honest, and open communication with our employees allows individuals to raise concerns and have them directly addressed by leadership; it allows us to continuously improve our workplace and employee experience. Our goal is to hear from and listen to everyone. Here are some of the many ways an employee can choose to communicate with management:\\n\\nOpen Door Philosophy We believe candid and constructive communication in an environment of mutual respect is essential to our collective success. We have an \"open door\" policy, which means we welcome and encourage any employee to discuss suggestions, concerns, or feedback with their manager, a Human Resources team member, or any member of Amazon\\'s leadership team.\\nVoice of the Associate Boards Voice of the Associate boards are in Amazon fulfillment centers around the globe--physically and virtually--providing employees a forum for expressing their concerns, offering suggestions, and asking questions on a daily basis to leadership. Leadership teams reply directly to questions, promoting dialogue and efficient remediation of issues. In 2019, our fulfillment center managers received and responded to over 225,000 comments, questions, and issues raised on the Voice of the Associates boards.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n69\\nConnections Connections is a real-time, company-wide employee feedback mechanism designed to listen to and learn from employees at scale to improve the employee experience. Each day, Connections questions are delivered to every Amazon employee on a computer, a workstation device, or hand scanner. Employees may choose to answer or not answer any question, and individual responses are aggregated and shared with managers at the team level to maintain confidentiality. Connections analyzes response data and provides insights to managers and leaders to review and take actions as they uncover issues or see opportunities to improve.\\n Connections generates over 500,000 responses from employees daily.  Connections is live in 51 countries, at over 2,500 unique sites/locations, and questions are delivered in\\n21 languages.\\nExecutive Escalations Suggestions or complaints sent to a member of the senior leadership team are considered \"Executive Escalations.\" Any employee can utilize this method of providing a suggestion or raising a concern to leadership. All escalations are independently reviewed by Human Resources, used as a learning opportunity, and may be used to update our processes to prevent gaps in the future.\\nAppeals Process In the U.S. and Canada, the Appeals Process is a dispute resolution mechanism for employees in our in-scope lines of business (such as customer service, customer fulfillment, and sort centers) to challenge certain disciplinary actions. A second level manager, General Manager, or a panel of peers may review the issues raised in an appeal, including management decisions, to determine if a policy or practice was applied properly and consistently. If not, we will remediate the issue in line with our policies and practices.\\nEthics Hotline Employees may raise questions or report suspected violations of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics through Amazon\\'s Ethics Line in over 20 languages. Calls to the Ethics Line are answered by an independent third party and may be made anonymously upon request. Our Business Conduct and Ethics team records, reviews, and investigates calls for potential violations of the Code and tracks cases through to remediation where necessary. Allegations of violations of the Code are also reported up to the Audit Committee.\\nAssociate Insight Surveys and Pulse Surveys Annual surveys ask employees to anonymously express opinions about issues in the workplace, and managers respond by remediating issues or making improvements.\\nRegular In-Person Meetings Through all-hands meetings with General Managers, stand-up meetings with direct supervisors, and regular roundtables with senior leadership, employees have daily opportunities to engage with leaders, raise issues, and make suggestions to continually improve our workplace.\\nFreedom of Association We respect freedom of association and our employees\\' right to join, form, or not to join a labor union or other lawful organization of their own selection, without fear of reprisal, intimidation, or harassment. These rights should be exercised in an informed and thoughtful manner. Amazon has associates represented by some form of collective bargaining in many countries. We value worker feedback, and are committed to providing our employees with appropriate access to grievance mechanisms and remedial action, regardless of collective bargaining presence. We firmly believe it is in our employees\\' and the company\\'s best interests to continue our direct communications, and the best way to effect positive change is for our employees and us to continue working together directly.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n70\\nSustainability Ambassadors\\nAt Amazon locations around the world, more than 4,500 employees join together as Sustainability Ambassadors--a grassroots organization of Amazonians working to expand the efforts of the global teams that work directly on managing Amazon\\'s environmental and social impacts. The Sustainability Ambassadors program started in 2017 with chapters in corporate offices and fulfillment centers in the U.S. and Europe. The program continues to expand, now with over 160 teams around the world.\\nRecognizing that global challenges require global participation, Sustainability Ambassadors seek opportunities to lead and collaborate, using their collective action to amplify and deliver on Amazon\\'s ambitious sustainability goals. Ambassadors raise awareness of sustainability as a practice for all Amazonians by delivering environmental education through on-site events. They lead projects and pilot initiatives within buildings and across communities, striving to make Amazon the most sustainable place to work.\\nExamples of initiatives include: diverting products from waste into donations for people in need; developing innovations in recycling programs to include new products and locations; setting up local commute options like carpool programs and bike to work challenges; conducting energy audits with local utilities and implementing new energy efficiency programs; organizing community cleanup events at local beaches, parks, and wetlands; and developing services aimed at helping customers meet their own sustainability goals.\\nAmbassadors based in our fulfillment centers and operations facilities focus on sustainability projects that help sites deliver on their carbon reduction goals. The program provides a community platform to share best practices and scale sustainability across our worldwide networks. In Poland, one Ambassador team collectively redesigned the waste segregation process in their fulfillment center, driving waste recycling rates up by over 40%.\\nAmbassadors in our corporate offices have a unique opportunity to launch ideas with data-driven analysis using Amazon technology. For example, after auditing waste at our global headquarters in Seattle, Ambassadors developed a proposal to improve waste sorting using DeepLens--a deep learning enabled video camera from Amazon Web Services. A team of Amazon employees built a dataset and model that used DeepLens\\' object detection capabilities to identify the waste items being discarded and use built-in audio to tell people which bin to use for a given item.\\nThe combination of ground-level action with scalable ideas and advanced technology makes Sustainability Ambassadors critical partners in achieving Amazon\\'s larger sustainability goals.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n71\\nCOVID-19\\nFrom the beginning of the pandemic, we have worked tirelessly to support and protect our employees, customers, and the communities we operate in during this time of crisis. Our top concern is ensuring the health and safety of our employees, and we expect to invest approximately $4 billion on COVID-related initiatives getting products to customers and keeping employees safe.\\nWe\\'ve made over 150 process updates--from enhanced cleaning and social distancing measures to new efforts like aerosol disinfectant spraying. We\\'re spending over $85 million redeploying team members, including some of our most talented software engineers, moving them from their typical roles onto teams where they can work on cutting-edge safety programs. We distribute personal protective equipment to our employees and require them to use face coverings while at work. We introduced and scaled temperature checks across our worldwide facilities. As of May 2020, we have:\\nProvided 100 million+ masks to our fulfillment center and office sites. Added 2,298 handwashing stations. Added 5,765+ janitorial staffers to our typical teams. Provided an additional 34 million gloves. Added 48 million ounces of hand sanitizer. Purchased 31,000+ thermometers and 1,115+ thermal cameras. Worked on building scalable testing for coronavirus.\\nWe\\'re continuing to innovate and find new ways to support the health and safety of our employees. One of the most promising opportunities we\\'ve discovered to improve workplace safety comes from artificial intelligence and machine learning. We are now using computer vision technologies in our buildings to help site leaders identify high traffic areas and implement additional measures to improve social distancing. This program, which we call \"Distant Assistant,\" provides immediate feedback to our employees on whether they are maintaining six-feet of physical distance from one another. As people walk past the camera, a monitor displays live video with visual overlays. Individuals remaining six feet apart are highlighted with green circles, while those who are closer together are highlighted with red circles. The on-screen indicators are designed to remind and encourage employees to maintain appropriate distance from others. We are excited to open source the software and AI behind this innovation so that anyone can create their own Distance Assistant. Individuals and businesses large and small can download the package at no cost and get up and running with just a computer and camera.\\nOur colleagues are on the front lines, helping customers in communities around the world in a way very few can--delivering critical supplies directly to the doorsteps of people who need them, particularly the elderly and those with underlying health issues. Here are some of the things we are doing to support our employees:\\n We gave our employees a special one-time Thank You bonus totaling over $500 million. All front-line employees and partners who were with the company throughout the month of June 2020 will receive a bonus.\\n If one of our employees is diagnosed with COVID-19, they will receive up to two weeks of paid time off. This time off is in addition to their other paid and unpaid time off options.\\n We established a $25 million relief fund for partners (e.g., delivery drivers) and seasonal employees facing financial hardship or quarantine.\\nLearn more about how we are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic on our Day One blog.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n72\\nSupply Chain\\nAmazon is strongly committed to conducting our business in a lawful and ethical manner, including engaging with suppliers who respect\\nhuman rights, provide safe and inclusive workplaces, and promote a sustainable future.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n73\\nAbout Our Supply Chain\\nOur mission is for our products to be made in a way that respects human rights and the environment. Our global teams work closely with suppliers to communicate our standards, and help suppliers build their capacity to provide working environments that are safe and respectful of human rights.\\nOur Approach to Responsible Sourcing Our standards are derived from the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Core Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. To ensure our policies and programs incorporate these internationally recognized human rights standards, we conduct formal benchmarking with industry peers and multi-stakeholder organizations to continually improve our program. We regularly review our Supply Chain Standards against policies developed by industry associations (such as the Responsible Business Alliance and the Consumer Goods Forum) in consultation with external stakeholders including Nest, Business for Social Responsibility, Impactt Limited, and Verit.\\nOur Sourcing Footprint Hundreds of thousands of workers, employed by suppliers around the globe, make our Amazon-branded products. The suppliers that produce Amazon-branded apparel, consumer electronics, food and beverage, and home goods products are shown on our supply chain map, which is updated regularly and is available to download. We believe supply chain transparency is crucial to our approach to human rights due diligence and ensuring worker protections. We publish our supplier list to provide customers and external stakeholders visibility into where we source and to contribute to transparency efforts across industries. When we receive information about potential issues in our supply chain we investigate and take appropriate action to remediate.\\nAssessment of Risk We routinely evaluate our supply chain to understand the highest risks to workers and prioritize our efforts. To do this, we engage key internal and external stakeholders, analyze our risks using international risk indices such as the World Bank\\'s Worldwide Governance Indicators, run worker surveys, and conduct assessments that include worker interviews, management interviews, document review, and on-site visits. We regularly consult industry experts to review our approach to risk assessment against globally recognized international standards and industry best practices.\\nSupplier Assessments Our Responsible Sourcing Program focuses on suppliers of Amazon-branded products, consisting of Amazon Private Brands and Devices and a curated selection of brands exclusively sold on Amazon. Through this program, we engage in robust supplier due diligence, prioritizing mechanisms that drive continuous improvement. We are committed to working with our suppliers to remedy issues and establish systems to prevent future issues. We expect our suppliers to consistently monitor and enforce our standards in their own operations and supply chain as well as make improvements to meet or exceed our expectations. We use independent auditors to verify supplier compliance with our standards though regular on-site inspections and confidential worker interviews.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n74\\nIn 2019, we conducted a total of 4,082 assessments to help us determine which suppliers to work with and, for those we do engage, to help us continually understand and improve those suppliers\\' practices. We utilize three types of assessments:\\nPre-Production Assessments Suppliers must submit an Amazon-approved assessment of their facilities before beginning production of Amazonbranded products.\\n 44% of assessments conducted in 2019 were Pre-Production Assessments.\\nOngoing Assessments Suppliers must submit Amazon-approved assessments on an ongoing basis while producing Amazon products.\\n 35% of assessments conducted in 2019 were Ongoing Assessments of active suppliers.\\nVerification Assessments Where issues are identified, suppliers must develop a corrective action plan detailing actions to address identified issues, a long-term plan to prevent reoccurrence, and where necessary, undergo a follow-up assessment to ensure issues are properly remediated.\\n 21% of assessments conducted in 2019 were Verification Assessments to verify remediation.\\nOur approach is based on a commitment to workers and to continuous improvement; we put the safety and interests of workers first. Suppliers are required to meaningfully participate in any investigation and take immediate action in the event that issues are found. An acceptable corrective action plan details the root cause of the issue and the steps, both short- and long-term, that supplier management will take to fix it. In most situations, we will support suppliers through the remediation process, but where a supplier refuses to remediate, we may choose to terminate the relationship. Failure to meet our standards has been a factor in our decision to terminate hundreds of suppliers.\\nSupply Chain Standards and Supplier Manual\\nOur mission is for our products to be made in a way that respects human rights and the environment. Our global teams work closely with suppliers to communicate our standards and help suppliers build their capacity to provide safe and respectful working environments.\\nSupply Chain Standards We set a high bar for ourselves and our suppliers. Our Supply Chain Standards detail the requirements and expectations for suppliers, vendors, and service providers throughout our supply chain, and suppliers must commit to these standards as a condition of doing business with us.\\nSupplier Manual Our Supplier Manual provides guidance and resources to suppliers of Amazon-branded products on how to meet and exceed the expectations outlined in our Supply Chain Standards.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n75\\nSupplier submits\\nAmazon-approved audit of facility\\n\\n    Key Stages of Supplier Assessment and Issue Remediation:\\n\\nIf issues are identified, Amazon will issue a request for\\na Corrective Action Plan\\n\\nRemediation of identified issues is tracked through follow-on verification audits\\n\\nOnce in production, supplier is audited on an\\nongoing basis\\n\\nIf supplier refuses to remediate an issue, Amazon may choose to\\nterminate relationship\\n\\nAbout Our Assessment Results: Suppliers are assessed across four main categories: 1) Labor, 2) Health and Safety, 3) Environment, and 4) Ethics. These categories are divided into subcategories, such as non-discrimination, emergency preparedness, hazardous substances, and transparency. Findings within each subcategory are flagged as High, Medium, or Low depending on the level of severity.\\nOver the last three years, Amazon has focused on setting a high bar for new suppliers and refusing to go to production until suppliers remediate all High level findings identified in our assessments. Since 2017, the proportion of audits with High and Medium level findings on Labor and Health and Safety has decreased (Labor decreased by 15.7 percentage points and Health and Safety decreased by 8.8 percentage points).\\nWe recognize that some issues may take time to effectively remediate. For Medium level issues, we expect suppliers to show they are making meaningful progress toward remediation within a defined timeline. For Low level issues, we monitor suppliers for continuous improvement. We have dedicated teams based in key sourcing countries around the globe that work directly with our suppliers to identify solutions to challenging problems and promote open dialogue. We seek to create long-term relationships with suppliers who align with our values and who are committed to constantly improving conditions for workers. Where we see trends in issues beyond individual suppliers, such as widespread health and safety deficits or industry-wide failures to responsibly protect migrant workers, we work to define regional or global strategies to address underlying systemic challenges.\\nThe most common High and Medium level finding in 2019 was the Wages and Benefits subcategory. Examples of findings in this subcategory are: failure to pay overtime at the appropriate overtime rate, wage payments were delayed, or required government deductions have not been properly paid. The second most common finding in 2019 was Emergency Preparedness and Response--for example, a malfunctioning fire detection system or a blocked emergency exit. We are committed to driving improvement in these areas.\\n\\nOur Supply Chain\\n\\nAcross the Globe\\n\\n14%\\n\\n1% 1%\\n2% 2% 2% 2%\\n5%\\n\\n40%\\n\\n15%\\n\\n16%\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n76\\nProgress in 2019\\nBeyond individual supplier improvements, in 2019, we invested in programs to address complex regional and systemic issues identified through assessment data, risk assessments, or by external stakeholders:\\n\\nAddressing Wages and Benefits: Compliance with our standards on wages and benefits persists as a common issue across suppliers in our Responsible Sourcing Program, as evidenced by the frequency of this finding among our suppliers. In 2019, we updated our Supply Chain Standards to include language encouraging suppliers to pay a fair wage and announced that worker wages is one of our key commitments areas as a program. In 2020 and 2021, we will dive deeper in to the root causes of this issue and the actions that Amazon and our suppliers need to take to reduce future findings on wages.\\nWomen\\'s Empowerment: Women have the power to be agents of change in workplaces and society. Ensuring women workers in our supply chain have the resources and information to make choices on their health, their safety, and their finances empowers them to overcome structural and societal disadvantages and improves outcomes for all workers. We have committed to investing in women\\'s empowerment and, in 2019, we began a partnership with the BSR HERproject, an initiative that brings together global brands, their suppliers, and local partners to create and implement workplace-based interventions on health, financial inclusion, and gender equality. Through our partnership with HERproject, we engage with suppliers in China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and India. As of June 2020, we reached over 8,700 women, building the capacity of workers and factory management to combat gender-based discrimination in the workplace.\\nEmphasis on Supplier Transparency: Supplier transparency issues were one of our most common High and Medium severity findings in both 2017 and 2018. Over the last year, we focused on increasing our communication with suppliers through pre-assessment outreach and on-site engagements to explain our standards and expectations of suppliers. We also improved our supplier-facing materials--including publication of a Supplier Manual--detailing our process and the importance of transparency. Building on our leadership principle of Earns Trust, we seek to build solid, trusting relationships with our suppliers over time that lead to better sharing of information.\\n\\nIncreased Investment in Health and Safety Programs: Health and Safety subcategories continue to be one of our most common assessment findings, particularly Emergency Preparedness and Response and Industrial Hygiene. In 2019, we began working with the International Labor Organization\\'s SCORE Program, a lean manufacturing program focused on improving productivity and working conditions in small- and medium-sized manufacturers. We enrolled suppliers in India and China to improve supplier management systems and their ability to effectively and efficiently meet health and safety standards. The program offers training and assistance in implementing improvement plans across five areas: workplace cooperation, health and safety, quality management, clean production, and human resources. In 2020, we will continue to enroll additional suppliers and develop a monitoring and evaluation mechanism for measuring impact on health and safety performance.\\nResponsible Recruitment: Forced labor is a complex and often hidden crime. Suppliers frequently lack basic awareness of the risks inherent in worker-paid recruitment fees or the importance of a process for responsibly managing migrant worker recruitment. Our standards require suppliers to reimburse in full any fees paid during the recruitment process. We are working to educate our suppliers on the issue, helping them develop the appropriate management systems, and ultimately minimizing the risks of forced labor. In 2020, we developed a Responsible Recruitment Guidebook in collaboration with labor rights nonprofit Verit. This guide provides suppliers with practical strategies to prevent forced labor risks and remediate worker-paid recruitment fees. In 2020, we will launch in-person trainings on responsible recruitment for our suppliers in Malaysia, Taiwan, and Japan. We are also working with the Responsible Labor Initiative to advance industry-wide approaches to ensuring responsible recruitment.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n77\\nCASE STUDY\\nEnhancing Worker Safety and Well-Being in the Bangladesh Garment Industry\\nHealth and safety in Bangladesh factories persists as an issue, particularly in the garment industry. In 2019, we learned that products sold by third-party selling partners in the Amazon Store were potentially linked to factories with unsafe working conditions in Bangladesh. We took immediate action to remind selling partners that Amazon\\'s Supply Chain Standards apply to all products sold on Amazon and that under those standards, Amazon expects all products sold in the Amazon Store or provided to Amazon to be manufactured or produced in safe, healthy, and inclusive work environments.\\nWe issued new guidance specifically prohibiting the selling of products made in factories deemed ineligible under the Bangladesh Accord or Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which evaluates Bangladesh garment factories for workplace safety. We removed any products connected with such factories from our Amazon Store. We also notified selling partners that we will evaluate all credible allegations or reports of selling partner violations of our Supply Chain Standards, including but not limited to those published by governments, reputable investigators, journalists, or human rights defenders.\\nIn addition to engaging third-party selling partners at issue in the allegations, we went further to proactively engage all suppliers manufacturing Amazon-branded products in Bangladesh. We require verification of the safety of building structures and electrical and fire safety issues, and we conduct on-site inspections with certified engineers for the highest risk issues to track closure. We enhanced our pre-sourcing screening process for new Bangladesh suppliers to ensure that adequate building safety equipment and systems are in place as a pre-condition to being approved for Amazon production.\\nAs a way to further support workers in the Bangladesh garment industry, we also invested in the Amader Kotha Helpline which provides workers throughout the region, including many of Amazon\\'s own suppliers, with a grievance mechanism to report and quickly resolve factory concerns in the ready-made garment sector in Bangladesh.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n783\\nThe following table includes data from our assessments in 2019, including suppliers not currently producing for Amazon.\\nHigh and Medium Level Findings by Subcategory in 2019 (% of all assessment findings)\\n\\nSubcategory Labor\\nFreedom of Association Freely Chosen Employment Humane Treatment Non-Discrimination Subcontractor and Next-Tier Supplier Responsibility Wages and Benefits Worker Grievance/Complaint Mechanism Working Hours Young Workers Ethical Behavior Business Integrity Transparency Environment Hazardous Substances Pollution Management and Prevention Health and Safety Emergency Preparedness and Response Industrial Hygiene Machine Safeguarding Sanitation, Dormitory, and Canteen\\n\\nHigh/Medium Severity\\n0.4% 3.2% 0.1% 0.4% 0.1% 40.7% 0.0% 7.9% 0.5%\\n2.3% 2.9%\\n0.0% 0.1%\\n10.5% 9.5% 0.1% 2.3%\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n79\\nSupply Chain Commitments\\nWe evaluate our supply chain to identify the industries, countries, and issues where we have the greatest opportunities to identify and address risks and have a positive impact on workers. In the event we identify an issue in our supply chain, we act fast and prioritize solutions from the workers\\' point of view.\\nWe work with industry partners to tackle systemic issues and implement programs that support continuous improvement for our suppliers and workers. As a part of our due diligence efforts to identify, prevent, and mitigate adverse impacts, we leverage internal and external data and guidance from external stakeholders including industry experts, civil society groups, and non-governmental organizations.\\nWe are committed to assessing our impact and focusing our efforts in the following key commitment areas:\\nSafe Workplaces: Safe and healthy workplaces are a top priority for Amazon. We have global teams who partner with suppliers to increase worker awareness of safety issues, promote worker participation in their facility\\'s safety culture, and promote initiatives focused on the well-being of workers on issues that matter most to them.\\nOur suppliers must provide workers with a safe and healthy work environment; suppliers must, at a minimum, comply with applicable laws regarding working conditions. Additionally, we are committed to driving improvement in these key priority areas: (1) occupational safety, including adequate machine safeguarding, and ensuring suppliers continually identify, evaluate, and control physically demanding tasks to ensure that worker health and safety is not jeopardized; (2) emergency preparedness and response planning; and (3) sanitation and housing--if suppliers provide residential facilities for their workers, they must provide clean and safe accommodations.\\nWe conduct on-site assessments of Amazon-branded suppliers to determine safety conditions throughout our business relationship. This includes assessments of protections such as adequate fire safety systems, sanitary dormitories and facilities, and adequate machine safeguarding.\\nWe require that these suppliers address material safety issues prior to beginning production with Amazon. Assessment results are reviewed regularly by the leadership of our Amazon-branded businesses, and corrective action plans are implemented with suppliers as needed.\\nFreely Chosen Employment: We will not tolerate the use of forced labor in our supply chain. Our Supply Chain Standards prohibit all forms of forced labor and human trafficking; this includes charging workers recruitment fees, holding passports or personal documentation, and coercion to work through threats of deportation or contacting immigration authorities. During assessments of Amazon-branded suppliers, we track where workers migrated from and how much they paid in recruitment fees. If fees have been paid, we require the supplier to reimburse workers in full. Forced labor is a hidden crime that is hard to combat. We recognize real progress in this space will only be achieved through collaborative action--by companies, governments, and civil society--to spur system-wide change. Learn more about our approach to forced labor in our annual Modern Slavery Statement. Amazon is currently working with these organizations to devise holistic approaches to combating forced labor:\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n80\\nPolaris: Amazon supports Polaris, a nonprofit that assists trafficking victims and survivors. Through the U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline, Polaris has identified and responded to over 63,000 cases of human trafficking and labor exploitation since 2007. AWS works with Polaris to infuse cutting-edge technology into its infrastructure to accelerate the development of the largest known U.S. data set on trafficking. Polaris uses that data to understand and improve the way trafficking is identified, how victims and survivors are assisted, and how to prevent this abuse.\\nResponsible Labor Initiative: The Responsible Labor Initiative is a multi-industry, multi-stakeholder initiative focused on ensuring that the rights of workers vulnerable to forced labor in global supply chains are consistently respected and promoted.\\nTech Against Trafficking: Tech Against Trafficking (TAT) is a coalition of technology companies collaborating with global experts to help eradicate human trafficking using technology. Amazon sits on the TAT steering committee and has leveraged the expertise and resources of AWS to help scale tech solutions in the anti-trafficking field.\\nThorn: Thorn, an organization that builds technology to defend children from sexual abuse, leverages AWS architecture and machine learning tools in their product Spotlight. Spotlight\\'s sophisticated machine learning capabilities save time for investigators by automatically flagging ads likely to represent at-risk children. Investigators can set customized alerts and search Spotlight\\'s constantly growing database of ads to aid in their investigations. Spotlight has helped identify more than 14,000 child sex trafficking victims.\\nUnseen: Amazon has made a three-year commitment to work with UK modern slavery helpline Unseen, investing in their efforts to provide immediate and long-term support to potential victims of modern slavery and to ensure the helpline\\'s continued growth.

Launch supplier improvement program focused on responsible recruitment by the end of 2020.\\nEmpowering Women: Quality jobs for women translate to positive impacts for communities, and we are actively working to empower women to make their own decisions on health, finances, and career development. This includes collaborating with globally recognized programs such as Better Work and Business for Social Responsibility\\'s HERproject. Through our partnership with HERproject, we engage suppliers in China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and India. As of June 2020, we had reached over 8,700 women with training on health and financial skills, building the capacity of workers and factory management to combat gender-based discrimination in the workplace.\\nOUR GOAL: Launch empowerment programs to reach over 25,000 women in our supply chain by 2023.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n81\\nFair Wages: We are committed to working closely with suppliers, business partners, and multi-stakeholder associations to monitor and promote continuous improvement in working conditions, including fair and on-time payment of wages. We have dedicated teams across the globe that work directly with suppliers to track and report performance against these standards.\\nOur suppliers are required to pay legally required compensation (including overtime and benefits) and we encourage our suppliers to continuously evaluate whether workers earn enough to meet their basic needs and the needs of their family.\\nWe require Amazon-branded suppliers in a number of regions to enroll in Better Work--a partnership between the International Labor Organization and the International Finance Corporation focused on improving working conditions in the garment industry and making the sector more competitive. By working with suppliers and training workers on their rights, Better Work is able to help workers improve wages over time.\\nOUR GOAL: Launch in-depth research into fair wages within our Amazon-branded products supply chains in 2021.\\nEnvironmental Protection: Our aim is to ensure that the manufacturing of our products does not cause unnecessary environmental harm, and positively impacts people and communities. We are a member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (Coalition), an industry-wide group of leading apparel and footwear brands, retailers, manufacturers, non-governmental organizations, academic experts, and government organizations working to reduce the environmental and social impacts of apparel products around the world. We encourage our Amazon-branded suppliers to evaluate their practices using the Coalition\\'s Higg Index, a tool to help manufacturers measure the social and environmental performance of their facilities. We are committed to driving adoption of this assessment and helping our suppliers understand their environmental impact.\\nOUR GOAL: Collect environmental performance data from 200 suppliers by the end of 2021.\\n\\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\\n\\n82\\nCOVID-19\\nAmazon is committed to supporting our suppliers, their workers, and their communities as they are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have dedicated over $1 million in initial investments to support response and recovery efforts in our supply chain.\\nWe are continuing to monitor suppliers for compliance with our Supply Chain Standards and are making necessary modifications to supplier assessment procedures based on internal and external stakeholder recommendations. We are working to balance the need to limit the movement of people and allow suppliers time to support workers and prepare production schedules with the need to have our eyes and ears on the ground.\\nWe have urged suppliers to take the following steps to mitigate risk to workers:\\nFollow all government safety recommendations before resuming or continuing to manufacture Amazon-branded products and take appropriate steps to ensure safe and clean workplaces.\\nAvoid ending worker contracts where workers are sick or caring for sick family members.\\nEnsure monitoring of worker hours and proper overtime notices as factories ramp up production.\\nWe are partnering with organizations providing critical support to suppliers and workers during this devastating pandemic:\\n In Bangladesh, we\\'ve partnered with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to distribute medical supplies and COVID-19 related resources for front-line doctors, nurses, and medical workers operating in the largest refugee camp in the world. The contribution supports the procurement of lifesaving PPE for 23 IOM-managed health facilities, serving to benefit both refugee and host community populations in the region.\\n Amazon is supporting the implementation of SCORE Training in 42 factories, which is helping factories plan their production schedule, reorganize production lines, and implement guidelines for more social distance and increased safety. Factories enrolled in the SCORE program receive support implementing health and safety protocols and providing workers with training on health and sanitation, which has improved the working conditions of 20,000 workers, including 9,000 women.\\n As part of our longstanding relationship with BSR\\'s HERproject, we helped to launch HERessentials, a new venture that will digitize HERproject\\'s and Empower@Work\\'s learning modules into a six-module Digital Worker and two-module Digital Manager Toolkit curriculum for remote access. The toolkit covers topics like personal hygiene, reproductive health and breastfeeding, and financial planning, and offers local resources on mental health and domestic violence services.

As part of this partnership, we have been able to distribute over 100 economic relief grants to artisan businesses across the globe. We were also able to support the Nest\\'s PPE Purchasing initiative--a program that purchased over 200,000 protective masks to be delivered to front-line workers. This program distributed over $500,000 in economic relief value to 57 businesses, which altogether employed 10,510 skilled artisans.\\n We are supporting the Amader Kotha Helpline, which provides workers with a grievance mechanism to report and resolve factory concerns in the ready-made garment sector. Our contribution will help support the organization\\'s increased call volumes and the 24/7 factory grievance lines in regions impacted by COVID-19. The Helpline serves as a resource for 600+ factories, 30 of which are Amazon suppliers, reaching 1.5 million workers in Bangladesh, and supporting them in safely transitioning back into the workplace.\\n In India, we partnered with Swasti--a global nonprofit committed to ensuring access to quality healthcare for workers and those in marginalized communities--to adapt their worker well-being program (Invest4Wellness) to provide support to workers in factories impacted by COVID-19. With our support, Swasti is setting up a worker helpline, developing health protocols for workers to return to work safely, establishing an emergency response team, and providing critical mental health, healthcare, and social entitlement support to workers, their families, and their communities.

Resolving to do this without taking precious resources from the planet means holding ourselves and our suppliers to ever higher standards. We know that accomplishing this work will require all of our best efforts. At Apple, we are committed to building groundbreaking products and services with the mission to leave our world better than we found it.\\nIt was just a year ago that we reached our goal of covering 100 percent of our operations with 100 percent renewable electricity. That work continues as we source the clean energy needed to maintain that standard -- even as our company grows. And our learnings have paid off in significant ways as we help the manufacturers in our supply chain make the same energy transition we have. To date, more than 40 suppliers have made commitments to join us, putting us well on track to exceed our goal of putting 4 gigawatts of clean energy online by 2020.\\nAt the same time, we are launching the next phase of our industry-leading work to better use and reuse materials with a state-of-the-art lab to support our research and innovation with material recovery. This initiative, along with Daisy - our fearless disassembly robot, means we\\'re doing even more with the materials from old devices our customers return for recycling. And we\\'ve found new ways to make it easier for devices that still have value to go on to another user. Our launch of the new MacBook Air and Mac Mini with enclosures made from 100% recycled aluminum was just the beginning: Together, we\\'re pioneering a future where we no longer need to mine precious materials from the Earth to make our products.\\nAt Apple, it\\'s simple. We apply the same level of innovation that goes into everything we create, design, power and manufacture to making things better for people and the planet. And we make it simple for customers and partners who share our passion to join us in this work. In a time where the threats facing our planet are too great to ignore, we are demonstrating that businesses must play a vital role. We are proud to do the hard work, to make the breakthroughs, and tirelessly search for ways to ensure the better future for our planet that we all deserve.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 3\\nOur ambition: to make products without taking from the Earth.\\n\\nWe\\'ve embarked on a bold mission to make products without taking from the Earth.

The electricity at all of our facilities worldwide, including every Apple office, store, and data center, comes from 100 percent renewable energy--a standard we have maintained, even as we continue to grow. And we\\'re doing even more to transition our suppliers to 100 percent renewable energy and make our products of low-carbon materials.\\n\\nHighlights\\n\\nEmissions reductions\\nWe\\'ve significantly reduced our carbon emissions: by 64% since 2011 for Apple\\'s direct operations (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and by 35% for Apple\\'s entire footprint since it peaked in 2015.\\n\\nSupplier clean energy\\n44 Apple suppliers have committed to power all of their Apple production with 100% renewable energy.

That includes the emissions beyond our direct control, like those from sourcing materials, making our products, and our customers using their devices. We calculate our carbon footprint in five major areas: corporate facilities, product manufacturing, product use, product transportation, and product end-of-life processing. We use this information to tell us where to focus.\\nWe prioritize use of renewable energy, starting with our own facilities. We\\'ve transitioned to 100 percent renewable energy for the electricity we use at our offices, retail stores, and data centers around the world, which has reduced facilities emissions to only 2 percent of our comprehensive carbon footprint.5 And we\\'ve extended our efforts into our supply chain, where product manufacturing represents 74 percent of overall emissions. Whether designing a product, an operating system, or a manufacturing process, we consider the environmental impact--alongside cost, durability, form, and functionality. And because the cleanest energy is the energy you never use, we\\'re reducing energy use at facilities we operate as well as those where our suppliers make our products.\\n\\nOur approach to climate change\\n\\nRenewable energy Transition Apple and our suppliers to 100%\\nrenewable energy\\n\\nLow-carbon design Transition product materials,\\nmanufacturing processes, and operating systems to low-carbon alternatives\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\nEnergy efficiency Reduce energy use\\nat corporate and supplier facilities\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 8\\nApple\\'s overall carbon footprint (fiscal year 2018)\\nApple calculates its life cycle carbon footprint to understand where to focus reduction efforts.\\n\\n74% Manufacturing\\n\\nmaciOdlSe12\\n\\nother13\\n\\n19% Product use 5% Product transport\\n2% Corporate facilities <1% End of life\\n\\nactimvaec 11OS\\n\\niOS active charge 10\\n\\nApple\\'s carbon footprint\\n25.2 million\\nmetric tons of CO2e\\n\\nfinal assembly\\n\\nintegrated circuits6\\n\\nsteel\\n\\nelectronics9\\n\\ndispla\\n\\ny other manufacturing 8\\n\\naluminum\\n\\nboards and flexes7\\n\\nNote: Manufacturing, Product use, Product transport, and End of life are Scope 3 emissions.

A major contributor to the decrease was Apple\\'s Supplier Clean Energy Program, which lowered our carbon footprint by nearly 3.6 million metric tons compared to last year. We also made several product design changes that reduced our carbon footprint, like sourcing aluminum made with hydroelectricity and recycled content, improving product energy efficiency, and redesigning integrated circuits to use less silicon. Together, these product design changes resulted in 4.8 million fewer metric tons of carbon emissions compared to last year.\\nHistorically, Apple\\'s carbon footprint has paralleled its financial performance. However, beginning in 2015, our environmental work has driven down our carbon emissions, even as revenue has increased.\\n\\nHistorical carbon footprint\\n\\n40\\n\\n270\\n\\nApple\\'s carbon footprint (million metric tons CO2e) Annual revenue (billion $)\\n\\n30\\n\\n210\\n\\n20\\n\\n140\\n\\n10\\n\\n70\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\\n\\nFiscal year\\n\\nApple revenue\\n\\nLifecycle carbon footprint\\n\\nEmission reductions\\n\\nSince 2015, Apple\\'s emissions reduction efforts have led to a significant decline in its comprehensive carbon footprint. Without these efforts, Apple\\'s fiscal year 2018 emissions would have been 35 percent greater.\\n\\nNote: We have been calculating the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of our products since 2007. Over time, we have greatly refined our model to include more Apple-specific data instead of industry averages. We made significant modeling changes in fiscal year 2016 to improve how we calculate emissions from the integrated circuits in Apple products, which resulted in a decrease in manufacturing emissions. And we make systematic changes each year to reflect changes in global electricity grids.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 10\\nRenewable Energy\\nCharting the course to 100%.\\nApple pursues the strongest possible renewable solution in all markets where we operate. We stress a regional approach, with long-term energy contracts from new projects we help create. The following three principles guide this strategy:\\n Local displacement. We seek to displace more-polluting forms of energy in the same electric grid region as our facilities. We accomplish this by having Apple-created projects deliver into the grid as much renewable energy as our facilities take from it. In difficult renewable energy markets where our needs are less than 0.5 percent of our total energy use, we seek a renewable energy solution in the broader geographic region.\\n Materiality. We want our involvement in a renewable energy project to be a driving force to getting it built. That might mean providing needed financial support or helping the project overcome regulatory barriers. With the rapidly changing policy dynamics in some of our key countries, we\\'re adapting our framework to continue to comply with local laws and regulations and to yield the most positive and real energy transformation.\\n Accountability. We apply rigor in measuring and tracking our energy supply resources and use third-party registries such as WREGIS and NC-RETS, certification programs such as Green-e Energy, and contractual provisions to ensure that only Apple takes credit for the renewable energy it generates or procures. When no such system exists, we work with industry partners and governmental entities to create them.\\nApple Park, our newest corporate headquarters, obtains about 75 percent of its power from onsite fuel cells and rooftop solar PV panels.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 11\\n600+ MW\\nOf the renewable energy projects Apple has helped create, we have direct ownership in over 600 megawatts. This is among the largest direct investments in renewable energy by a non-energy company.\\n\\nPowering all our facilities with 100% renewable energy.\\nSince 2018, 100 percent of the electricity we\\'ve used at our facilities has come from renewable sources. To secure renewable energy projects, we\\'ve taken on project ownership, made equity investments, sparked creative new partnerships with utilities, and entered into power purchase agreements. We\\'ve also deployed a variety of technologies like wind, solar PV, micro-hydro projects, and biogas fuel cells. (See Appendix B for a comprehensive view of solutions we\\'ve implemented to secure renewable energy at our facilities.)\\nWe first focus on energy efficiency to reduce the total electricity we use, then source renewables for our remaining needs. We create new renewable energy projects whenever possible. As of January 2019, approximately 66 percent of the renewable energy Apple uses comes from projects that Apple created. And we aim to soon cover our entire electricity load with Apple-created projects. We use three contracting structures to do this.\\n Direct ownership. Where feasible, we source our own renewable energy by building our own projects, including solar, wind, biogas fuel cells, and low-impact hydro projects.\\n Equity investment. In some markets, we invest capital to become part owner of new solar PV or wind projects and match that renewable generation with our energy use.\\n Long-term renewable energy contracts. At other times, we sign long-term contracts for renewable energy in order to support new, local projects that meet our robust renewable energy sourcing principles, primarily solar PV and wind projects.\\nIn cases where we need more renewable energy than what\\'s generated by our Apple-created projects, we directly purchase renewable energy from newer projects in nearby markets, or through available utility green energy programs. When these options are not available, we are willing to procure robust renewable energy credits (RECs) tied to recently constructed projects, applying the same rigor to these purchases as we do to our Apple-created renewables. When Apple acquires RECs, we require that they are Green-e Energy certified, where available, and come from the same power grid--and preferably in the same state or country--as the Apple facility they support.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 12\\nHow we\\'re staying at 100%.\\nTo get to--and stay at--100 percent renewable energy for the electricity at our global facilities, we\\'ve implemented new approaches to securing renewable energy: We\\'ve expanded into new markets, we\\'re leveraging large projects to increase others\\' access to renewable energy, and we\\'re investing in projects without support of government subsidies.\\nNew markets.\\nSince 2017, we have been procuring renewable energy in new markets that we only recently entered or in which we have small loads--like India, Turkey, Israel, Brazil, Mexico, and Taiwan-- to cover our loads in those and neighboring countries. And as we continue to grow our global operations, we\\'ll continue building projects in new markets.\\nFor example, in Taiwan we worked with a local partner to build a rooftop PV system and secured a long-term contract for Apple to own the project\\'s renewable energy certificates. We will verify our purchase by using Taiwan\\'s newly created T-REC tracking system.\\nAggregation.\\nWe\\'re investing in large-scale renewable energy projects in the Great Lakes and mid-Atlantic regions totaling 245 megawatts of generation: an Illinois wind farm and a Virginia solar PV array. These projects will cover our electricity use at our retail stores and offices on the East Coast, as well as co-located data facilities in Chicago, Illinois, and Ashburn, Virginia. In addition, we\\'ve directly helped other companies access the same high-quality renewables that Apple is procuring. By working with others, we can help open the renewable energy market to companies of all sizes and accelerate the pace of new renewable generation.\\nSubsidy-free projects.\\nAs renewable energy markets around the world evolve and the technology becomes more cost-competitive, we\\'re looking to develop projects without the government subsidies that were designed to encourage development of renewable energy. This will enable us to retain ownership of the renewable energy credits of projects we invest in. In Denmark we contracted for a new wind farm and a 42-megawatt solar PV project--one of Denmark\\'s largest--using a commercially backed contract-for-difference power purchase agreement, the first of its kind in Denmark.\\nIn China, we\\'re working to create cost-competitive, subsidy-free renewable energy solutions for our facilities and suppliers. To encourage this transition, we supported China\\'s voluntary REC market with the largest purchase to date, and kept our retail stores and corporate offices at 100 percent renewable in the process.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 13\\nWe\\'ve significantly reduced our emissions.\\nOur transition to renewable energy has reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 64 percent since 2011, preventing over 2.8 million metric tons of COe from entering the atmosphere. That\\'s equivalent to taking more than 590,000 cars off the road for one year.14\\n\\nThe WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol defines the methodology for calculating carbon emissions.\\nScope 1 emissions are those greenhouse gases resulting from fuel combustion from sources we own or operate--like vehicles or natural gas for heating.\\nScope 2 emissions refer to those resulting from use of electricity.

As of April 2019, we already have commitments far exceeding our goal.\\n\\nLeading suppliers to switch to renewable energy.\\nApple also takes responsibility for the carbon emissions that occur in our supply chain. Manufacturing makes up 74 percent of our carbon footprint. Most of those emissions come from the electricity used to make the parts in our products. So we\\'re helping our suppliers reduce their energy use and transition to new renewable energy sources.\\nWe announced Apple\\'s Supplier Clean Energy Program in 2015, and we\\'ve seen enormous growth in just three years. In 2018, Apple and our suppliers invested in, or procured from, 1.9 gigawatts of operational clean energy that collectively generated 4.1 billion kWh. This clean energy generation avoided about 3.5 million metric tons of COe--roughly equivalent to the electricity needed to power over 600,000 homes in the U.S. for a year.14\\n\\nProgress toward 4 gigawatts\\n\\nApril 2017 April 2018 April 2019\\n\\nGoal: 4 GW by 2020\\n\\n0\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\nOperational (GW)\\n\\nCommitted (GW)\\n\\nTo ensure our program achieves the greatest positive impact, we have stringent social and environmental standards for supplier clean energy projects.

Initially, 10 suppliers and Apple will jointly invest nearly $300 million over the next four years.\\n\\nApple\\'s role.\\nApple supports supplier transitions to clean energy. We work with them to advocate for policy change in key markets. We connect suppliers with high-quality clean energy projects and developers. And we educate them on how they can take full advantage of the benefits of clean energy.\\nDemonstrating leadership.\\nThe transition to renewable energy can be highly complex. It often requires complicated deal structures across many regions, each with their own statutory and regulatory requirements. We gained invaluable experience by meeting our own 100 percent renewable energy goal in 43 countries, and we\\'re using that expertise to help develop nearly 500 megawatts of solar and wind projects in China and Japan. These projects are addressing upstream emissions in our supply chain as well as demonstrating our commitment to the Supplier Clean Energy Program.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 15\\nEducating partners.\\nWe share our learnings with our supplier partners and help them plot their transition to renewable energy. In 2017, Apple developed the Clean Energy Portal, an online platform to help suppliers identify commercially viable renewable energy solutions in regions around the world. We continue to add new content, including policy guidance and financial analysis tools, intended to make adoption of clean energy in key markets even easier. Over 100 suppliers have registered for the site.\\nAdvocating for strong policy.\\nClean energy technology offers tremendous benefits to our suppliers, to electricity grids, and to countries. So we actively support policies that create cost-effective renewable energy markets, and we work closely with suppliers to engage local, regional, and national governments. This encourages the development of policies that support scalable renewable energy solutions.\\n\\n\"The Supplier Clean Energy Program is at the center of Apple\\'s commitment to making world-class products with greener manufacturing.

We think about how to make them powerful while using as little energy as possible. We use materials efficiently, and we source from materials that have a low-carbon profile.\\nDesigning our products to use less energy.\\nEnergy efficient products not only maximize battery life, but they\\'re better for the environment, too. We establish aggressive efficiency targets early in the design phase, and we consistently outperform ENERGY STAR, which sets the standard across commercial products in the U.S. In the last 10 years, we\\'ve decreased average product energy use by 70 percent across all Apple\\'s major product lines.4 For example, the 11-inch iPad Pro introduced in fall 2018 is 69 percent more efficient than the ENERGY STAR standard. MacBook Air with Retina display consumes three times less power in sleep mode than the previous-generation MacBook Air. When you multiply these reductions by all the Apple devices in the world, the impact on our carbon footprint really adds up.\\n69%\\nThe 11-inch iPad Pro models are more than 69 percent more efficient than the ENERGY STAR standard.\\n40%\\niMac Pro consumes 40 percent less power during sleep and off mode--the result of an innovation in power supply design.15\\n3X\\nMacBook Air with Retina display consumes three times less power in sleep than the previous-generation MacBook Air.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 18\\nLowering impact by design.\\nOur carbon footprint tells us which components are carbon intensive, so we know where to focus our efforts. We reduce the amount of material we need to make certain components by changing the design and re-engineering manufacturing processes. And by sourcing from recycled or renewable materials, we can often further decrease the carbon emissions from certain components.\\nIntegrated circuits, or chips, make up a large portion of our manufacturing carbon footprint. Turning a silicon wafer into an integrated circuit is an energy-intensive process. So we seek out ways to reduce the amount of silicon used in chips, while maximizing their performance. The A11 and A12 chips used in iPhone 8, X, XS, XS Max, and XR allow more processing power to be packed into smaller silicon dies, which reduced Apple\\'s 2018 carbon footprint by 160,000 metric tons.\\nThe carbon footprint of aluminum enclosures of MacBook computers has been steadily decreasing since 2015--for some products, it\\'s over six times less. We\\'ve done this by sourcing aluminum from hydro-powered smelters, improving the material efficiency of manufacturing processes, and increasing recycled content in our products. And by using 100 percent recycled aluminum for the enclosure of the new MacBook Air with Retina display, we cut the product\\'s carbon footprint in half.\\n\\nPaving the way for carbon-free aluminum smelting\\n\\nAluminum is a key material in many of Apple\\'s products, and, for more than 130 years, it\\'s been produced through a carbon-intensive process. Through a partnership with aluminum manufacturers Alcoa Corporation and Rio Tinto Aluminum, announced in May 2018, that\\'s changing. The joint venture between Alcoa and Rio Tinto will commercialize patented technology that eliminates direct greenhouse gas emissions from the traditional smelting process, a key step in aluminum production. This is a revolutionary advancement in the manufacturing of one of the world\\'s most widely used metals.\\nAs part of Apple\\'s commitment to reducing the environmental impact of its products through innovation, the company helped accelerate the development of this technology. And Apple has partnered with both aluminum companies, and the governments of Canada and Quebec, to collectively invest a combined $144 million to future research and development.\\n\\nThe world\\'s first aluminum produced through a carbon-free smelting process.\\n\\n\"Apple is committed to advancing technologies that are good for the planet and help protect it for generations to come. We are proud to be part of this ambitious new project, and look forward to one day being able to use aluminum produced without direct greenhouse gas emissions in the manufacturing of our products.\"\\nTim Cook\\nApple\\'s CEO\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 19\\n8 million sq. ft.\\nIn fiscal year 2018, we implemented energy efficiency measures in more than 8 million square feet of Apple facilities, with a combined annual electricity use of over 350 million kWh--resulting in an average energy savings of about 12 percent. In the past two years, we have made energy efficiency improvements to 17 million square feet.\\n\\nEnergy Efficiency\\nThe cleanest energy is the energy you never use.\\nEven as we\\'re aggressively transitioning to renewable energy at our corporate facilities and in our supply chain, we prioritize energy efficiency. When we use less energy, we have less to procure from clean sources.\\nTo increase energy efficiency at our Apple\\'s offices, data centers, and retail stores, we start with designing buildings to optimize energy use. For existing buildings at our facilities and in our supply chain, we conduct energy efficiency audits to identify system improvements that could reduce energy use.\\nA more energy efficient Apple.\\nIn 2018, we have continued to expand our energy efficiency programs to data centers, retail stores, offices, and R&D facilities located around the world. This past year, we have opened new buildings on Apple campuses in Cork, Ireland; Hyderabad, India; and Shenzhen, China. Each of these buildings exemplifies Apple\\'s commitment to energy efficiency with measures such as efficient HVAC systems with optimized air distribution, heat recovery, and radiant cooling; rooftop solar thermal; and occupancy controlled efficient lighting throughout.\\nWe also implemented a program within the past year to significantly reduce the energy consumption of new retail stores worldwide. We\\'re creating energy models during the design process to benchmark energy use and using those models to evaluate specific efficiency measures. The result is energy savings of approximately 10 to 30 percent, thanks to more thoughtful design and selection of building envelope components, lighting, and HVAC systems, as well as controlling all of these systems as efficiently as possible.\\nIn fiscal year 2018, we reduced our energy use by an additional 42 million kWh and 150,000 therms--a significant increase in energy savings compared to last year, due to the expansion of our program. Combined with ongoing energy savings from past years, we are now cumulatively saving over 113 million kWh of electricity and 2.5 million therms of natural gas per year, which corresponds to avoiding 43,199 metric tons of CO2e from entering the atmosphere.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 20\\nA more energy efficient supply chain.\\nIn 2015, we started engaging directly with suppliers to help them reduce their energy use. We aim to educate them about energy efficiency, identify energy efficiency project opportunities, and manage those projects to completion. We prioritize facilities with the highest energy use and potential for improvement. Then we conduct energy audits and train suppliers to uncover opportunities for energy efficiency--like replacing outdated or inefficient heating, cooling, and lighting systems; repairing compressed air leaks; and recovering waste heat. The assessments provide suppliers with a cost-benefit analysis for implementing energy efficiency improvements.\\nSince the inception of this program in 2015, we have engaged 59 suppliers at 85 facilities. In 2018, our program implemented energy efficiency measures that prevented 466,000 metric tons of COe from entering the atmosphere.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 21\\nDaisy, Apple\\'s line of disassembly robots, can now disassemble 15 models of iPhone, recovering more of the important materials stored inside.\\n\\nResources\\nPutting the planet\\'s limited materials to good use.

We make the most of materials by reducing waste and creating long-lasting products. And when our customers return products through Apple Trade In, we make sure the materials in those devices are used again and again.\\nOur strategy is to create circular supply chains and reduce our impact on the planet\\'s resources by:  Designing and building products and packaging with recycled and renewable materials,\\nand using materials more efficiently.

Learn more >\\n\\nSourcing recycled and renewable materials.\\nWe aim to end our reliance on mining. That\\'s why we are transitioning to recycled16 and renewable materials, and maximizing material efficiency, all while maintaining the exceptional quality and finish of our final products.\\nWith such a broad ambition, we needed a robust, data-driven way to determine where to start. So we assessed 45 elements and raw materials based on their environmental, social, and supply impacts. The resulting Material Impact Profiles helped us identify a short list of materials on which to focus first. And we continue to use these profiles to determine which materials to tackle next.\\nEach material requires a different solution. For some, like rare earth elements, recycled material is not widely available. So simply understanding the barriers to recovery requires significant exploration, and the learning represents meaningful progress. For other materials, like tin, recycled material markets are more robust. So we piloted uses of recycled tin in select applications and brought them to scale. Throughout these explorations and across many materials, we\\'ve deepened our relationships with downstream recyclers. And we\\'ve partnered with suppliers further upstream to use fewer materials and find alternative, recycled sources.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 26\\nAluminum\\nTo use 100 percent recycled aluminum, we had to invent a whole new kind. Standard recycled aluminum accumulates impurities each time it\\'s recycled. So we engineered an alloy that can accommodate scrap sources of aluminum and delivers the same strength, durability, and flawless finish. We use sophisticated computational models to identify an alloy chemistry that can withstand a countless number of recycling loops. Our own products and processes are a valuable source of aluminum scrap for our custom alloy, including iPhone enclosures recovered by Daisy. In fall 2018, we introduced MacBook Air and Mac mini models with 100 percent recycled aluminum enclosures. And use of recycled materials helped cut the carbon footprint of each product nearly in half. In 2019, these efforts will allow us to avoid mining more than 900,000 metric tons of aluminum-bearing bauxite.\\nCobalt17\\nWe use cobalt primarily in batteries. A limited supply of recycled cobalt is available on the market for use in batteries like ours, not because recyclers lack the ability to recover cobalt, but because many recyclers don\\'t have enough scrap sources, like batteries. So we set out to find new sources of scrap for our recyclers, starting with our own supply chain. We began sending iPhone batteries recovered from Daisy, Apple\\'s iPhone disassembly robot, to our upstream recycler in Apple\\'s battery supply chain. And after a successful pilot program, select battery and final assembly suppliers now send Apple\\'s battery scrap to our recycler upstream. Recycled cobalt from both scrap sources is being recycled into the batteries of new Apple products--a true circular supply chain.\\nCopper\\nAs a highly conductive metal, copper is used to make our printed circuit boards, cables, and connectors. We\\'re engaging with our suppliers to investigate new methods to manufacture our printed circuit boards in a way that uses less copper. For the copper we do use, we are moving to recycled sources. We are currently certifying the recycled copper content in the printed circuit boards of select iPhone models and estimate that the recycled copper used for these products represents over 60,000 metric tons of mined ore. To increase our contribution to recycled material streams, Daisy now liberates seven different components from which copper can be recovered, including the main logic board and the camera. And we\\'re directing these components to recyclers and smelters that can recover copper at high rates.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 27\\nGlass\\nFor glass, we\\'re focused on material efficiency and recovery. We\\'re working with our cover glass suppliers to ensure that all glass scrap generated during the manufacturing process is recycled at the highest level possible. Glass is incredibly sensitive to impurities and changes in composition--even the production of new devices introduces impurities--so maintaining the quality is essential for recycling glass.\\nGold18\\nGold is already recovered at high rates due to its value. We\\'re continuing to identify ways to reduce the amount of gold we use in the plating of components like our printed circuit boards. In iPhone XS, for example, gold represents less than 0.01 percent of the overall product mass. We\\'re working within the complex gold supply chain in order to increase the use of certified recycled gold.\\nPaper\\nWe\\'ve successfully created a closed-loop, circular supply chain for paper. For the second year in a row, 100 percent of the wood fiber in our packaging was either from recycled sources or from responsibly managed forests or controlled wood sources. And to ensure we\\'re not taking away from the world\\'s supply of responsibly sourced paper, for the third year in a row, we are protecting or creating enough sustainably managed forests to cover all the wood fiber we use in our packaging.\\nPlastics\\nWe\\'ve first focused on using less plastic through material efficiency. For example, we re-designed the way plastic was injected into the mold of a high-volume part in iPhone XS and iPhone XR, cutting the scrap produced by one-third. For the plastic we do use, we\\'re looking for renewable or recycled alternatives to fossil fuel-based plastics. However, we use vast numbers of distinct grades of plastic, each designed to meet specific requirements. We are systematically exploring and qualifying recycled and renewable alternatives for each grade, so that whatever type of plastic a product needs, we will have a recycled or renewable option. So far, we\\'ve identified recycled alternatives for 24 different grades of plastic, allowing us to use an average of 38 percent recycled plastic across 82 components for products released this year. In our packaging, we\\'re working to eliminate the need for plastics altogether, and we have reduced plastic in our product packaging almost by half in three years.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 28\\nRare earth elements\\nElements like neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium are used in magnets for audio applications, in cameras, and in haptics technology. Traditional recyclers don\\'t recover these rare earth elements, because they are used in small quantities and technology has not advanced sufficiently to recover them. However, Daisy recovers the small components that contain rare earth elements from iPhone. By consolidating these sources, we\\'re creating an opportunity for new technology to efficiently recover these materials.\\nSteel\\nOur primary use of stainless steel is in the enclosure of iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, and in some Apple Watch models. We\\'re working with our suppliers to increase and certify the recycled content in the stainless steel we source. And we\\'ve updated Daisy to recover the steel from iPhone enclosures and bands, which we then send to recyclers who are able to recover this highly recyclable material.\\nTin18\\nA market supply of recycled tin exists, but we need to make sure it meets our quality standards. In 2017, we proved we could use 100 percent recycled tin for the solder on the main logic board--where the majority of tin is found--of iPhone 6s. We\\'re now specifying 100 percent recycled tin for the solder of the main logic boards of seven subsequent iPhone models plus the newly released MacBook Air with Retina display, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Using recycled tin in Apple devices will prevent us from mining almost 29,000 metric tons of tin ore in 2019. But we want to recover as much tin as we\\'re using--and make sure the tin is recycled and put back into the world\\'s supply. Unfortunately, tin is not recovered by all electronics recyclers. So we\\'re prioritizing recyclers that recover tin, in addition to copper and precious metals, from the main logic boards and camera modules retrieved by Daisy.\\nTungsten18\\nTraditional recyclers shred products to quickly break them down. Though shredding makes separation easier, it can cause the recycler to lose many materials, like tungsten. That\\'s why we designed Daisy as an alternative to whole unit shredding. Daisy is able to separate out the Taptic Engine, which we send to speciality recyclers that recover tungsten from it. We\\'re also working with our suppliers to certify the use of recycled tungsten in our products.\\nLithium, tantalum,18 and zinc\\nAs we\\'ve advanced in our work to create circular supply chains, we\\'ve expanded our program to include other materials in our products, using the Material Impact Profiles to guide us. We recently added lithium, tantalum, and zinc. And we\\'ve already begun exploring new recycled sources and prioritizing recyclers that can recover these key materials.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 29\\niPhone XS meets the IP68 international standard for dust and water resistance. That means it can withstand being submerged to a depth of 2 meters for up to 30 minutes.\\n\\nBuilt to last as long as humanly possible.\\nYou count on your device day after day. So we design our products with durable materials, support them with ongoing OS updates, and make them easy to get repaired if anything happens. Because the longer a device is in use, the better use we make of the Earth\\'s resources.\\nDurable by design.\\nWe design our products for durability. For example, we built iPhone XS to meet the IP68 international standard for dust and water resistance, which means the devices can withstand being submerged to a depth of 2 meters for up to 30 minutes. And we prove that recycled and renewable materials can also meet our standards. For example, the solder in the main logic board of iPhone is made with 100 percent recycled tin that performs every bit as well as newly mined tin.\\nIn our Reliability Testing Lab, we amplify real-world conditions to enhance the durability of our designs. We test your device\\'s ability to withstand mechanical stresses, such as a sudden impact with a hard surface. In climate tests, we pit our devices against extreme heat and cold, dry and humid conditions, and intense sun exposure. Our chemical sensitivity tests evaluate the ability of devices to stand up to accidental spills like coffee, soda, sunscreen, or ketchup. We often go beyond international standards, and sometimes even create our own.\\nWith these tests, we intentionally push our products beyond their limits so we can study what happens. We then use state-of-the-art equipment, such as CT scanners and electron microscopes, to thoroughly understand impacts to the microstructure. This information flows back to our designers and engineers to enable further durability improvements. We repeat this cycle through our product development process until our products meet our rigorous performance standards.\\niOS updates your older device with new capabilities.\\niOS has the best software update mechanism in the industry, bringing updates to more devices than anyone else.

It makes devices faster and more responsive; for example, iOS 12 enables an up to 70 percent faster camera swipe, up to 50 percent faster keyboard display, and up to two times faster app launch on the iPhone 6 Plus.19 And many past generations of iPhone or iPad can take advantage of the latest features like Group FaceTime and Screen Time. Out of all devices using iOS--including those released many years ago--80 percent are using iOS 12.\\nBetter use of materials through repair.\\nWhen devices are repaired rather than replaced, we make better use of the materials in them. And we know even the most dependable products sometimes need service. That\\'s why we offer a network of more than 5,000 Apple Store locations and Apple Authorized Service Providers worldwide to provide safe, high-quality repairs. We offer battery replacement for all of our products--and we make sure the replaced batteries are recycled responsibly. Customers can access these repair locations in person or by mail. And we are continuing to expand our services.\\nTo make sure that repairs are performed safely, securely, and to the highest quality, we continuously train and certify service channel personnel, with over 265,000 active trained personnel. Our providers perform diagnostics and calibrations to target repairs precisely, avoiding unnecessary service and replacements of parts. When new parts are needed, only genuine Apple parts are used, so repaired devices work exactly the way they should. And all Apple-certified repairs are backed by Apple.\\nWe continue to expand access to high-quality and convenient repair options for our customers. Our new method for optimizing iPhone screen repairs has allowed thousands more independent shops to start offering this repair service.\\nWe offer a network of more than 5,000 retail stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers worldwide to repair devices so that they can be used longer.\\n\\n  Apple Authorized Service Providers Retail stores\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 31\\nApple Trade In\\nTrade in your device for credit toward a new one, or recycle it responsibly for free.\\nWe work closely with our recycling partners to help make sure:  Privacy is protected.  Devices are recycled safely and\\nresponsibly.  Applicable regulations are followed. See how it works >\\nIn spring 2019, we are launching a program with Best Buy in the U.S. and KPN in the Netherlands so that eligible iPhones will be sent to our disassembly robot Daisy.\\n\\nTrade it in. Help the planet out.\\nEven when you\\'re done with your device, chances are it still has more to give to the world. Apple Trade In is a simple way to exchange your old device for credit so that it can be reused by a new owner. If it isn\\'t eligible for credit, we\\'ll recycle it free of charge.20 Either way, your trade-in helps reduce the amount of materials that need to be mined from the Earth. That\\'s a trade-off that works for everybody.\\nRefurbishing for a new life.\\nOur devices are built to last. That\\'s why they often go on to a second or even third user. Through Apple Trade In, customers in 27 countries can trade in their devices either online or in-store. For products that still have more to give, customers can receive an Apple Store Gift Card or a refund on their purchase. These devices are repaired when necessary and sent to their next owner. If a product is at the end of its life, we\\'ll recycle it for free. We also collect and refurbish used devices through our iPhone Upgrade Program, AppleCare, and, inside Apple, our Hardware Reuse Program for employees. Altogether, we directed 7,860,000 devices to new users in fiscal year 2018. Keeping these devices in use rather than needing to make new products to serve those customers resulted in tangible material and carbon emissions savings.\\nRecycling for material recovery.\\nAfter sourcing responsibly and creating long-lasting products, we focus next on recovering materials. We participate in and offer product collection and recycling programs in 99 percent of the countries in which we sell products.21 These programs recycle our products and other electronics, all for free. In fiscal year 2018, we helped divert more than 48,000 metric tons of electronic waste from landfills. And we continue to make these programs more accessible.\\nTo truly end our reliance on mining, we also need to better capture the materials inside the products we recover. We created our disassembly robot, Daisy, to remove and sort components, so we can recover more materials at a higher quality than traditional recyclers can. This year, we updated Daisy to disassemble six additional iPhone models--15 models in total--from iPhone 5 to iPhone XS. Even while identifying models in real-time and disassembling devices with greater variation, Daisy can take apart 200 iPhone devices per hour. In the U.S. and the Netherlands, Daisy is now processing end-of-life iPhone models returned to us through Apple Trade In and AppleCare.\\nSome of the recovered materials are already heading back into our supply chain for new products. Most of the aluminum recovered from iPhone, for example, became part of the 100 percent recycled aluminum enclosure of MacBook Air. And cobalt we recovered from the iPhone battery is used to make new Apple batteries. Because of our efforts to keep harmful substances out of our products, these materials are safer to recover and reuse.\\nFor some materials, however, efficient recycling technologies don\\'t exist. We don\\'t believe technology should be a barrier to conserving the Earth\\'s resources. That\\'s why we created our new Material Recovery Lab in Texas. The lab will focus on three key areas: optimizing existing recycling practices, improving the ability to disassemble devices, and advancing research and development of the next generation of recycling technologies. We aim to benefit the broader recycling industry through this research. After all, the more material that gets reused, the less that needs to be mined from the Earth.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 32\\nComponents and materials Daisy recovers\\nMain Logic Board Tin Gold Copper Silver\\nReceiver Steel Copper Rare earth elements\\n\\nTaptic Engine Tungsten Rare earth elements Steel Copper\\n\\nWireless Charging Coil Gold Copper\\n\\nFor every 100,000 iPhone devices, Daisy has the potential to recover:*\\n\\nAluminum Gold Silver Rare earth elements Tungsten Copper Tin Cobalt Steel\\n\\n1,500 kg 1.1 kg 6.3 kg 32 kg 83 kg 1,000 kg 29 kg 790 kg 1,400 kg\\n\\nNew Enclosures (iPhone 8 and later)** Aluminum Copper Steel\\n\\nOld Enclosures (iPhone 7 and earlier) Aluminum Steel\\n\\nBattery Cobalt\\n\\nSpeaker Steel Copper Rare earth elements\\n\\nDock Flex Tin Gold Copper\\n\\nRear Camera Copper Tin Gold Rare earth elements\\n\\nFront Camera and Face ID Copper Tin Gold Steel\\n\\n* These quantities are based on an estimated product mix for what Daisy is likely to disassemble in the upcoming year, reflecting additional iPhone models.

The results are more beautiful than ever--for our packaging and for the planet.\\nCutting down on plastic.\\nIn three years, we\\'ve reduced our plastic use in U.S. product packaging by 48 percent. Starting with iPhone 7 and iPad Pro, we changed the plastic tray in the packaging to an all molded fiber alternative. This switch allowed us to also create iPhone XS and XR, iMac Pro, MacBook Air, iPad mini, and iPad Pro with majority-fiber packaging. And as of March 2019, we\\'ve transitioned to 100 percent fiber retail bags in all retail stores. These new bags even have a knitted paper handle and contain 80 percent recycled fiber.\\nUsing recycled and responsible sources.\\nWe aim to maximize the use of recycled paper in our packaging. In fiscal year 2018 we used 58 percent recycled paper, on average. When virgin paper is needed, we require our suppliers to source wood fiber from responsibly managed forests or Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) controlled wood sources.22 For the second year in a row, all of our packaging suppliers sourced their paper responsibly. And we conduct regular audits to ensure their claims.\\nOutside of packaging, less than 1 percent of our total fiber use is for our corporate offices--of which approximately 85 percent came from recycled or responsible sources in 2018.\\n\\nPackaging fiber and plastic footprint* (metric tons)\\n\\n37,000 21%\\n\\n34,000 21%\\n\\n24,000 14%\\n\\n19,000 10%\\n\\n2015 171,500\\n\\n2016 165,000\\n\\n53,000 31%\\n\\n81,500 48%\\n\\n50,000 30%\\n\\n81,000 49%\\n\\nPlastic\\n\\nRecycled fiber**\\n\\nVirgin fiber**\\n\\n* The packaging fiber and plastic footprint includes retail and shipping boxes. ** Beginning in FY18, we considered bagasse to be virgin fiber, instead of recycled fiber.\\n\\n2017 169,000\\n\\n51,000 30%\\n\\n94,000 56%\\n\\n2018 187,000\\n\\n60,000 32%\\n\\n108,000 58%\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 34\\nOur journey to responsible packaging\\n\\nProtecting responsibly managed forests.\\nWe don\\'t just specify that all of our virgin fiber be sourced responsibly, we also want to make sure we\\'re not diminishing the world\\'s supply of responsible paper. For the third consecutive year, production from the responsibly managed forests we\\'ve protected or helped to improve exceeded the amount of virgin fiber we used in our product packaging.23\\nOne year early, we achieved our 2020 goal of transitioning one million acres of forest across China to improved management. This is part of our five-year partnership with World Wildlife Fund, which is focused on three primary objectives:\\n Increase responsible management of working forests in China--by creating up to 375,000 acres of FSC-certified forests. And improve the management of up to 640,000 acres.\\n Contribute to the improvement of China\\'s policy framework to encourage responsible forest management.\\n Help China establish long-term market incentives for responsibly sourced paper.\\nIn addition to improving the management of 1 million acres of forest directly, the project has the potential to influence millions more by supporting the development of the China Sustainable Plantation Management Guidelines. These guidelines, informed by our project and released by China\\'s National Forestry and Grassland Administration, have been selected by the national government for use in the National Reserve Forest Plan, which guides the management of more than 40 million acres of forest.\\nIn the U.S., we continue to partner with The Conservation Fund (TCF) and support its innovative Working Forest Fund model. Through this fund, TCF purchases threatened working forests, protects them into the future through conservation easements, then sells the protected forest to begin the process again. So far, we\\'ve protected 36,000 acres of forest in the Eastern United States that are now certified as sustainably managed. And when forests thrive, so do local communities and wildlife.\\n\\n48%\\nreduction in plastic use\\nin 2018, compared to 2015\\n\\n58%\\naverage recycled wood\\nfiber content\\n\\n100%\\nof wood fiber in our packaging\\ncomes from responsibly managed\\nforests\\n\\n100%\\nWe are protecting or creating enough responsibly managed forests to cover all of the virgin paper we use in our packaging\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 35\\nZero Waste\\nFinding new ways to keep old materials out of landfills.\\nWe\\'re working to reuse, recycle, compost, or when necessary, convert into energy all the waste created by our own facilities and in our supply chain. Reaching this goal requires collaboration among multiple Apple teams, local governments, and specialty recyclers, and we\\'ve already seen great success.\\nA zero waste program for Apple facilities.\\nWe\\'re currently pursuing an ambitious goal of Zero Waste to Landfill at our more than 450 corporate facilities, our more than 500 retail stores, and our five data centers.24 Our first aim is to reduce the waste we generate by rethinking the materials we use--in areas from building renovations to food service. And for the waste we do create, we\\'re working to recover it to its highest and best use through robust composting, recycling, and reuse programs.\\nIn fiscal year 2018, we generated 74,000 metric tons of waste and diverted about 74 percent from landfill through recycling and composting, up 3 percentage points from fiscal year 2017. To reduce the waste we generate, we work with our upstream vendors to streamline materials used and select those designed with the environment in mind. For example, we set up new packaging standards for all of our data centers, eliminating unnecessary packaging and finding ways to reuse the packaging shipped. When we do create waste, we focus on managing it responsibly. In renovations across our hundreds of corporate facilities, nearly 85 percent of the furniture is recovered, repaired, and made available for reuse. And because lack of data is one of the biggest obstacles to managing waste well, we installed remote monitoring systems that allow us to identify problem areas and resolve them quickly and accurately.\\nAcross facilities that generate hazardous waste, Apple takes great strides to ensure it is managed responsibly. We complete regular audits of the Transportation, Storage, and Disposal Facilities (TSDFs) where hazardous waste is ultimately sent to be treated, recycled, or incinerated. Only facilities we audit are allowed to accept and treat the hazardous waste Apple generates. We take this commitment seriously--if any TSDF does not meet our strict standards for environment, health, safety, and waste management protocols, we send waste to an alternate, approved facility.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 36\\n1 million metric tons\\nThrough our supplier Zero Waste Program, we\\'ve diverted enough waste to cover more than 4,000 soccer fields 1 meter deep.\\n\\nA zero waste program for our suppliers.\\nIn 2015, we launched a Zero Waste Program for suppliers, which provides them with onsite support to recycle and reuse materials. The aim is to divert 100 percent of waste from landfills. We provide tools and guidance, including the services of experts in sustainable waste management.\\nInitially we prioritized suppliers with the most significant waste impact: final assembly facilities where components from all over the world come together to be assembled into Apple products. Our goal was to help these facilities drastically reduce the waste they send to landfill. And in 2018, we achieved UL\\'s Zero Waste to Landfill certification for all final assembly facilities across iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, AirPods, and HomePod.25 This includes the Appleoperated final assembly site in Cork, Ireland, which was the first Apple facility to receive the designation from UL.\\nWe\\'ve since expanded our efforts further upstream in our supply chain to include sub-assembly suppliers. However, the deeper we go, the more complex the waste streams become. So we are looking for new technological innovations, exploring up-cycling techniques to reuse by-products, and even reassessing manufacturing processes.\\nIn 2018, we diverted 375,000 metric tons of waste from landfills. And to date, we\\'ve engaged 90 suppliers and diverted more than 1 million metric tons of waste--enough to cover more than 4,000 soccer fields a meter deep.\\nWater Stewardship\\nProtecting Earth\\'s most precious resource.\\nWater supports all life on Earth. And while water itself is plentiful, only a small fraction is available to those who need it. The scarcity of freshwater continues to increase, a trend exacerbated by climate change. So we hold ourselves accountable for the water we use, whether at our corporate offices, data centers, distribution centers, and retail stores, or at our suppliers\\' facilities around the globe.\\nHow we\\'re tackling our water footprint.\\nWater is necessary to operate our corporate facilities, including for cooling at our data centers. At our manufacturing facilities, suppliers use water for processes like etching, cutting, cleaning, and cooling. So we work to conserve it and be smarter about the water we do use. We focus both on improving water use in our facilities and--through our Clean Water Program--helping our suppliers conserve water and prevent water pollution. And we are engaging communities where we operate and manufacture products to make sure shared water resources are protected and accessible. We\\'re proud of the progress we\\'ve made, but we know there\\'s still work to do.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 37\\nWe mapped our global water use to different levels of water risk. As a result, we\\'re focused on three locations with elevated water risk--Maiden, North Carolina; Mesa, Arizona; and Santa Clara Valley, California--where 52 percent of our total use occurs.\\n\\nTo continue to improve our water use by our facilities and our suppliers, we focus on:\\n Using water efficiently to reduce overall use.  Identifying alternative water sources, such as recycled and reclaimed water.  Discharging water responsibly to prevent pollution.  Expanding our water stewardship to keep watersheds healthy for all who rely on them.\\nWater resources are extremely local. That\\'s why we focus on areas where our efforts can have the largest positive impact. We map our global water use against water quality, quantity, and regulatory factors to understand which regions have an elevated risk. We then prioritize those locations based on how much water we`re using. We continually update our risk assessment based on new data and better understanding of the regional environments in which we are operating. And when engaging with suppliers, we put a special emphasis on working with those with high water usage, the potential for poor discharge quality, and facilities in waterstressed regions. Working with suppliers is key, as early assessments show that manufacturing represents the majority of our water footprint.26\\nUsing water efficiently.\\nWater is essential to the work we do. However, we aim to minimize the water used by our facilities and our suppliers\\' operations, especially in areas of elevated water risk. And by continuing to expand our reduction efforts, we aim to improve our footprint over time.\\nIn fiscal year 2018, Apple used about 1.26 billion gallons of water directly, a 26 percent increase over the previous year. This increase was driven largely by growth in a few locations, and by increased visibility into temporary water use. These temporary uses accounted for 140 million gallons of water in 2018, and include things like dust control for new construction and the establishment of mature, drought-tolerant trees in landscaping.\\nWater use at Apple facilities We track our corporate water use for our data centers, retail stores, and corporate offices.\\n\\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2018\\n\\n0\\n\\n300\\n\\n600\\n\\n900\\n\\n1200\\n\\n1500\\n\\nMillions of gallons\\n\\nFreshwater use\\n\\nRecycled water use\\n\\nTemporary freshwater use\\n\\nBeginning in fiscal year 2017, our boundary expanded to include more than 150 million gallons of water used annually at distribution centers and co-located data centers.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 38\\n5X\\nincrease in total water savings from the Clean Water Program in two years\\n\\nOur water footprint shows us that we need to continue to reduce our water demand. This year, a number of different water efficiency efforts helped minimize our freshwater use. We designed our latest data centers buildings in Maiden, North Carolina; Reno, Nevada; Viborg, Denmark; and China to use 80 percent less water for cooling than at previous data centers. In our retail stores, our newly launched back-of-store, or \"backstage,\" design includes low-flow fixtures that save up to 30 percent more water compared with our previous design. And at our corporate offices in Santa Clara Valley, our landscape efficiency program continues to reduce our outdoor water use--by more than 15.3 million gallons per year--through turf replacement and irrigation system upgrades. Around the world, our pursuit of water efficient design is expected to save more than 90 million gallons of water per year.\\nThrough our supplier Clean Water Program, we help those who make our products improve their water use by performing baseline assessments, providing technical support on watersaving improvements, and monitoring progress. Our suppliers conserved 7.6 billion gallons of water across 116 facilities in 2018, bringing the total cumulative savings to 21 billion gallons since 2013. These savings were achieved through diverse initiatives including installation of low-flow fixtures, use of meters to control consumption, and employee education. And since many of our suppliers also build components for other companies, we\\'re reducing the water footprint of non-Apple products, too.\\nFinding alternative sources.\\nAs we work to minimize our overall water use, we also look to alternative sources to help reduce freshwater withdrawals, including recycled water, reclaimed water, and harvested rainwater.\\nAcross our facilities, use of recycled water worldwide grew from 24 million gallons to 63 million gallons in fiscal year 2018. This reflects recycled water use in two of our three largest co-located data centers as well as offices in Elk Grove, Singapore, and India. We have also made significant investments to bring recycled water to our campuses in Santa Clara Valley, an effort that will replace over 30 million gallons of potable freshwater a year.\\nCaptured rainwater represents another alternative source of water for our facilities. In 2018, we captured and reused 4 million gallons of rainwater for cooling, irrigation, and construction needs at our Maiden, North Carolina, data center, and at our corporate offices in Cork, Ireland, and Yokohama, Japan. And our newest retail location, Apple Champs-lyses, features a rainwater collection system which can collect up to 1,800 gallons of water a day. This system will reduce potable freshwater use by 15 percent per year at the store.\\nWhen we engage suppliers, we also focus on ways to reclaim and reuse water. We look for creative sources of water to reclaim, including condensation from centralized air conditioning. For water reuse, even simple solutions can be highly impactful. For example, we encourage the re-use of the water used to wash products in-between production stages. As they are rinsed, products are moved from tub to tub of water, and as they do so, both the device and water gets cleaner. Simply moving rinse water in the opposite direction of the devices as it gets dirtier, rather than dumping it, allows the same rinse water to be reused two to three times. With solutions both simple and complex, we\\'ve increased the average water reuse to 39 percent across suppliers.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 39\\nWater Treatment Manager at a Clean Water Program facility for packaging manufacturing, China.\\n\\nDischarging water responsibly.\\nManaging wastewater discharge is also an important way to conserve water resources in a watershed.\\nAt our Santa Clara Valley campus, we\\'re implementing an onsite wastewater treatment system that will treat approximately 550,000 gallons per year of water onsite and return it to the municipal wastewater system. And at our data centers in Prineville, Oregon, and Reno, Nevada, our teams have been deploying a mineral filter media that allows us to recapture more of the water we use in cooling, reducing water discharge by up to 30 percent.\\nOur Supplier Code of Conduct includes standards for wastewater discharge quality, and we regularly audit for compliance with these high standards. Our Clean Water Program engagement goes beyond compliance to help our suppliers build world-class water management systems. We target supplier sites based on water discharge risk and launch intensive, multi-year engagements. We begin with a comprehensive assessment that leads to targeted improvements, including installation of improved infrastructure, use of cutting-edge wastewater treatment technologies, and the creation of systems for validating discharge. Throughout the program, we engage deeply to create cultural change and promote greater water literacy.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 40\\nPursuing water stewardship.\\nWater connects communities. It\\'s also essential for human health and thriving ecosystems. So we look beyond our own operations to restore water resources in critical regions and ensure that local communities have water access.\\nIn Prineville, Oregon, we created a water supply solution to meet the needs of Apple\\'s local data center and the broader community for years to come. We partnered with the City of Prineville to build an aquifer storage and recovery system, which uses natural underground spaces to costeffectively store water throughout the year for use in peak demand months. With a storage capacity of up to 180 million gallons--significantly more than we use for our data center--the system also helps mitigate future climate-related risks of water shortages.\\nApple and our suppliers have also partnered with the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS), a collaboration between businesses and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), in a program to support water management beyond the factory and into the community. We\\'ve launched a pilot project with five suppliers in the Kunshan region of China, an area with a cluster of electronics suppliers that is experiencing water-quality challenges. These five suppliers aim to meet the AWS global standards, which promote effective water management and safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) for local communities. Already, two Apple suppliers have received AWS certification, including the first Gold certification ever to be awarded in the electronics industry. And we plan to expand our supplier stewardship program to improve water quality at other sites like the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 41\\nApple Champs-lyses is expected to receive a BREEAM \"Very Good\" green building rating.

We actively apply green building principles to all of our offices, data centers, and retail stores around the world.\\nWherever possible, we pursue green building certifications like U.S. Green Building Council\\'s LEED certification and the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM). Apple Park, our new headquarters in Cupertino, is on track to be the largest LEED Platinum-certified office building in North America. When we constructed our Hollyhill building at our campus in Cork, it was one of only six in Ireland to be awarded an \"Excellent\" rating by BREEAM. And our data center in Viborg, Denmark, is LEED Gold certified--as are buildings at our data centers in Reno, Nevada; Maiden, North Carolina; Mesa, Arizona; and Prineville, Oregon.\\nAt our retail stores, we also apply green building principles to reduce our demand on the environment, while providing healthier spaces for our customers to experience our products. When we renovated a historic building on the Avenue des Champs-lyses for our new retail location, we installed environmental features like high-efficiency lighting systems, rainwater collection, and onsite PV panels, which are expected to earn the building a rating of \"Very Good\" from BREEAM. Our newly launched back-of-store design for retail locations reduces energy load by 40 percent and is made of recycled materials, including insulation made with 80 percent post-consumer recycled denim. More than 50 stores have already been built with this design. We have also committed to sourcing only Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified materials for all tables, benches, and wood fixtures in all new retail stores--nearly 150 locations and hundreds of tables in 2018 alone. FSC only certifies wood made from forests that protect water resources, promote biodiversity, and enhance the lives of workers and local communities.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 42\\nSince 2017, 100 percent of supplier assembly sites have adopted safer cleaners and degreasers with our help.\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\nMaking products as safe as they are sound.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 43\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\n45\\n\\nOur Approach\\n\\n46\\n\\nMapping and Engagement\\n\\n46\\n\\nAssessment and Management\\n\\n48\\n\\nChemistry Innovation\\n\\nMaterials are what make products faster, tougher, and more beautiful.

Our approach begins with collecting comprehensive chemical composition information for the substances used to make our products as well as the process chemicals, like cleaners and degreasers, suppliers apply when making our products. We use this information to evaluate supplier compliance with the Apple Regulated Substances Specification (RSS)--our own set of global chemicals restrictions that goes beyond regulatory requirements and is based on best industry practices or toxicology properties. We go even further by using the chemical composition information we\\'ve collected in order to assess the hazard and risk of unregulated substances. And if we ever identify a substance that needs replacement, we innovate with our suppliers to find safer alternatives.\\n\\nOur approach to smarter chemistry\\n\\nMapping and engagement Create a comprehensive inventory of chemicals used by suppliers to make our products\\n\\nAssessment and management\\nAssess and manage chemicals for risks to\\nhuman health and environment\\n\\nInnovation Transition to safer chemistries through chemical innovations, beyond what is required\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 45\\nGRE\\n\\nE N\\n\\nENSCRE\\nWe screen our materials with comprehensive risk assessment tools, including GreenScreen, which evaluates substances against 18 different hazards, including carcinogens, mutagens, and endocrine disruptors.\\n\\nMapping and Engagement\\nWe\\'re exhaustively mapping materials in our products.\\nEvaluating the chemicals in the tens of thousands of components used in our products is an enormous task, but it\\'s essential to our commitment to customer safety. It starts with creating an extensive inventory of chemicals used to make them. That means collecting information not just from our suppliers, but from their suppliers, too. We\\'re working closely with our partners to construct a detailed map of every chemical inside our materials, including many of the chemicals used to manufacture them.\\nWe go beyond what\\'s required by law to eliminate harmful chemicals from our products. In 2016, we launched the Full Material Disclosure (FMD) program, an ambitious initiative aimed at helping us more comprehensively understand the chemical composition of every substance in every part of our products. This can be challenging because it requires that suppliers disclose proprietary information. We overcome this by storing the data securely and limiting access to a select number of people within Apple who are responsible for toxicological assessments. We prioritize materials with the greatest risks, such as those used in high quantities or those with the greatest human exposure. We collect detailed chemical information for tens of thousands of components and over 75 percent of product mass for new iPhone, iPad, and Mac products. We won\\'t stop until we rigorously understand the chemistry of every material.\\nIn 2015, we went a step further by creating an inventory of chemicals that are used at supplier facilities but don\\'t reside in the products. We mapped the process chemicals used in our final assembly facilities and evaluated all control measures such as ventilation, personal protective equipment, and worker training programs. The mapping resulted in the further identification-- and continued replacement--of potentially harmful substances that required controls and personal protective equipment from cleaners at final assembly sites.\\nAssessment and Management\\nWe evaluate chemicals for risks to your health, and the planet\\'s.\\nIn 2002, we introduced the RSS, which identifies the harmful chemicals we limit or prohibit in our manufacturing processes and products. In 2006, we built our own Environmental Testing Lab, where our chemists look for any potentially harmful substances and test products to evaluate compliance with the RSS. Since the lab\\'s opening, we have expanded it to more than 30 times its original size and have regularly updated it with state-of-the-art equipment--like an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, liquid and gas chromatography mass spectrometers, and a laser-induced breakdown spectrometer similar to the one used by NASA. We even manufacture artificial sweat to simulate human exposure and evaluate the safety of our materials that come into contact with skin.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 46\\nAt Apple\\'s onsite environmental testing lab, chemists assess products for harmful chemicals.\\n\\nWith information collected from the environmental testing laboratory, and the FMD and chemical mapping programs, we can then generate comprehensive toxicology assessments. This includes GreenScreen, which considers 18 criteria to help us understand the materials\\' effects on people\\'s health and the environment. We also have inhouse, board-certified toxicologists who use lab testing and computer modeling to create toxicological profiles that previously didn\\'t exist--addressing a major challenge in this field. Only materials that pass our rigorous review process are accepted for our products.\\nWe\\'re just as committed to the safety of the people who make our products. We require our suppliers to follow the standards set in our RSS. In 2014, we launched our Chemical Management Program to help suppliers develop a comprehensive approach to managing chemicals safely. The program, which has grown to 113 participating supplier facilities, enables our partners to shift to safer chemicals and improve general safety, awareness, and training. And to help drive toward safer chemicals, we map chemicals use and screen them using GreenScreen to assess the safety of cleaners and degreasers used at supplier final assembly facilities.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 47\\n100%\\nSince 2015, 100 percent of the process chemicals used at our supplier final assembly facilities complied with Apple\\'s Regulated Substances Specification.\\n\\nChemistry Innovation\\nInventing ways to replace bad substances with good ones.\\nWe\\'re continually evaluating the materials used in our products and design to avoid harmful substances altogether. We seek to reduce and remove toxins, by developing new, safer chemistries. When there is not an existing alternative to a chemical we\\'ve determined harmful, we innovate. We work with our suppliers to develop custom chemistries made with safer substances. To find a replacement for PVC and phthalates, for example, we and our suppliers invested in four years of research and development to create power cords and headphone cables that had both the performance and chemistry that met Apple standards.27 This deep commitment to innovating on safer chemistries sets Apple apart from many others who still use PVC and phthalates in their cables.\\nWe began to identify and phase out harmful substances in the late 1990s, beginning with PVC in our packaging, and moving on to the lead that was in our display glass and solder.28 Since then, we\\'ve also replaced mercury displays with energy efficient and mercury-free LEDs and OLEDs; eliminated arsenic from display glass;29 replaced brominated flame retardants from thousands of parts such as enclosures, cables, circuit boards, and connectors, using safer metal hydroxides and phosphorus compounds in their place;30 and eliminated beryllium-copper connectors and springs from all new product designs.\\nWe\\'re also focused on replacing harmful substances in manufacturing process chemicals to keep workers in our supply chain safe. We have long been engaging with our manufacturing partners to ensure safe working conditions. After analyzing the chemical composition of cleaners and degreasers used at supplier final assembly sites, we chose to go a step further and replace all identified hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives such as ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, glycerol, and water. In our first year of this Safer Cleaner Substitution program, we helped 18 sites replace 24 problematic formulations.31 In addition, in 2018, we added n-Propyl Bromide (nPB) to our RSS list of banned process chemicals for cleaning and degreasing. These efforts seek to avoid use of harmful chemicals, which protects the people who make, use, and recycle our products and keeps pollutants out of the land, air, and water.\\nWe removed PVC and phthalates from all our power cords, headphones, and cables.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 48\\nA timeline of smarter chemistry\\nOur program initially moved beyond a strictly compliance focus in the late 1990s, when we started to phase out PVC from our packaging.

So we listen. We speak. We convene. We advocate. We lead. We learn. And we engage at all levels: locally, nationally, and internationally; and with policymakers, researchers, non-governmental organizations, other companies, and our customers. Every conversation, every meeting, and every presentation brings us closer to unlocking more environmental innovations that we--and others--can apply. Because bold ideas and creative solutions can emerge anywhere, from anyone, at any time.\\nMore partnerships. More progress.\\nWe work with a wide range of nonprofit, industry, government, and business partners from across the globe. We\\'ve built strong relationships with a broad group of stakeholders, including those who might disagree with our approach. We do this because we believe that addressing their concerns often leads to better solutions. Exposing ourselves to varied perspectives helps us challenge our assumptions and refine our methods. That\\'s critical when you\\'re pursuing a vision that\\'s as bold and complex as ours: to one day make products without taking from the Earth.\\nJoining industry associations allows us to work closely with some of the best companies across all sectors. Our memberships in organizations like the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), World Economic Forum\\'s Platform for Accelerating Circular Economy, Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Aluminum Stewardship Initiative, Ceres, Corporate Eco Forum, the Chinese Association of Circular Economy, Digital Europe--and most recently, the Japan Climate Leaders Partnership--provide us the opportunity to exchange ideas with those who share our commitment to a more sustainable future.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 51\\nLisa Jackson speaks at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union about the role of the private sector in spurring smart, innovative environmental action.

We also collaborated with Tsinghua University\\'s School of Public Policy and Management on its Summer Institute for China\\'s Green Innovators (SICGI) program. In the past three years, 112 students from 50 universities joined the program to identify creative policy solutions to environmental challenges through course training and internships with local environment agencies.\\nTo support our Smarter Chemistry work, in 2015, we formed a Green Chemistry Advisory Board, made up of some of the world\\'s leading toxicologists, researchers, and academics. The board helps us explore innovative ways to minimize or eliminate toxins from our supply chain and to incorporate the latest breakthroughs in green chemistry into our products and processes.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 52\\nCustomer engagement.\\nWe seek to engage customers in our environmental mission, giving them opportunities to join in our efforts. In the past three years, we have launched two customer-facing campaigns: Apps for Earth; and communications around the benefits of returning devices to Apple for trade-in or recycling.\\nApps for Earth was a 2016 partnership with app developers and customers that generated over $8 million to support World Wildlife Fund\\'s global environmental projects. As of November 2018, World Wildlife Fund has fully invested the funds raised in conservation projects spanning all seven continents. These projects have helped protect wildlife through improved tracking, increase access to freshwater in vulnerable communities, promote sustainable food production and consumption, improve community management of forests, use technology to advance ocean conservation, and build resilience in ecosystems threatened by climate change.\\nFor every device received through Apple Trade In during a two-week period around Earth Day 2018, Apple made a donation to Conservation International. We then partnered with the nonprofit to use the funds to protect and restore a 27,000-acre mangrove forest in Colombia, which is expected to sequester 1 million metric tons of CO2 over the project\\'s lifetime. These mangroves not only protect the coasts and help support the livelihood of those communities where they grow, they can also store up to 10 times more carbon than forests on land. This is because mangroves store significant amounts of \"blue\" carbon in the soil below the water line, in addition to storing carbon in their roots, leaves, and branches like other trees. Our project with Conservation International was the first to fully value the entire ecosystem-- trees and soil--for its climate mitigation value. We hope this effort will encourage the protection of threatened mangrove ecosystems globally as important resources in the fight against climate change.\\nWe also donated to the SEE Foundation in China with funds raised from the Earth Day campaign. With this contribution, SEE Foundation supported 20 grassroots NGOs in China focused on enhancing waste management and pollution control. SEE also facilitated crossindustry collaboration such as introducing Zero Waste concepts to the outdoor sports industry.\\nStakeholder roundtables.\\nOver the past several years, we have invited key stakeholders to participate in roundtables in Europe, the United States, and China to obtain feedback on Apple\\'s key environmental programs, like our work on Smarter Chemistry and our ambition to create a circular supply chain for the materials in our products. Attendees at these roundtables have included a range of academics, NGOs, industry leaders, and other companies. Since these meetings, we have collaborated with subject-matter experts, think tanks, NGOs, and consulting firms to support our work.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 53\\nSpeaking up for stronger climate policies.\\nClimate change is one of the greatest threats facing our planet. Clean energy technology offers tremendous benefits to our suppliers, electricity grids, and communities around the world. We believe that if policymakers fully and properly value these benefits, clean energy becomes more cost-competitive than fossil fuel energy. Market and policy design is not one-size-fits-all, so we work closely with our suppliers and local experts to find the best solution for each country. For the past four years, we have been advocating for strong climate policies that promote decarbonizing our economy and support procurement of renewable energy.\\n\\nJuly 2015 (U.S.): Apple joined the White House\\'s American Business Act on Climate Pledge, in which participating companies voiced support for a strong outcome at the COP21 in Paris and demonstrated an ongoing commitment to climate action.\\nApril 2016 (U.S.): Apple joined Google, Microsoft, and Amazon to sign an amicus brief in support of the U.S. EPA\\'s Clean Power Plan\\nJune 2016 (World): Lisa Jackson addressed 700 senior government, business, and community leaders at the seventh Clean Energy Ministerial, where she called for governments across the world to put a price on carbon to address climate change.\\nApril 2017 (Japan): Apple joined nine other companies, including Fujitsu, Ikea, Microsoft, Patagonia, and Sony to formally encourage the Japanese government to promote corporate renewable energy use.\\nJune 2017 (China): Apple spoke at the eighth Clean Energy Ministerial in China to highlight our commitment to climate change, particularly our partnership with suppliers to reduce carbon emissions from manufacturing.\\nJune 2017 (U.S.): Apple urged the White House to remain in the Paris climate agreement and take meaningful action on climate change\\nAugust 2017 (China): Apple met with central and provincial-level policymakers across China to advocate for corporations to be able to purchase directly from renewable energy power plants.\\nNovember 2017 (China): Apple hosted a roundtable with the Green Electricity Consumption Cooperative Organization (GECCO) to create a platform for buyers in China to discuss renewable energy procurement challenges and opportunities, and inform future policy.\\nNovember 2017 (Vietnam): Apple joined a number of other companies urging the government of Vietnam to make regulatory changes allowing companies to procure renewable energy through direct power purchase agreements.\\n\\nMarch 2019 (Kenya): Apple participated in the UN Environmental Assembly and conducted bilateral discussions with a number of countries to advocate for policies that enable a circular economy and bold action on climate.\\nJanuary 2019 (Vietnam): Apple met with government officials to discuss benefits of electricity market reform, including allowing businesses to purchase power directly from renewable power plants.\\nDecember 2018 (China): Apple provided feedback and insights on its approach to renewables procurement in China in support of a publication developed to help the broader corporate community identify renewable energy solutions.\\nOctober 2018 (Japan): Apple spoke about clean energy and closed loop innovation at Japan\\'s Innovation for Cool Earth Forum (ICEF), an international gathering to tackle climate change through technical innovation.\\nOctober 2018 (South Korea): Apple met with government officials in Korea to advocate for increased renewable generation and for retail choice, whereby consumers can select their power source.\\nApril 2018 (U.S.): Apple filed individual comments to the U.S. EPA, urging it not to repeal the Clean Power Plan because of its importance in reducing emissions.\\nApril 2018 (China): Apple submitted formal comments to China\\'s National Development and Reform Commission about the implications of draft policy on corporate clean energy procurement.\\nFebruary 2018 (Japan): Apple filed comments with the Japanese government, calling for the development of a robust and verifiable renewable energy trading system.\\nJanuary 2018 (U.S.): Apple filed comments to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, urging it not to finalize a rule that would subsidize fossil fuels, which would limit the ability of renewables to compete in the electricity market.

Over time, we have greatly refined our model to include more Apple-specific data instead of industry averages. The decrease in Scope 3 emissions in fiscal year 2016 is partly due to these modeling changes, including improved modeling of the integrated circuits in Apple products. Further, there are systematic changes made in some emissions factors to reflect changes in global electricity grids.\\n Scope 3 emissions associated with employee commute and business travel are included in the table \"Facilities Environmental Performance Indicators.\"\\n Carbon emissions associated with our products\\' end of life decreased in fiscal year 2017, because of changes in methodology to more accurately reflect disposal and recycling practices.\\n Arsenic is present in minute quantities in some semiconductor devices.\\nEvery Apple product is free of PVC and phthalates with the exception of power cords in India, Thailand, and South Korea, where we continue to seek government approval for our PVC and phthalates replacement. 7Apple products comply with the European Union Directive 2011/65/EU and its amendments, including exemptions for the use of lead such as high-temperature solder. Apple is working to phase out the use of these exempted\\nsubstances where technically possible. 8 While Apple\\'s phaseout covers the vast majority of products and components, products by Beddit, which Apple recently acquired, and some older Apple product designs may not be fully BFRfree and PVCfree. However, these\\nproducts, including their replacement parts and accessories, were still designed to meet regulatory requirements.\\nOverview of Apple\\'s product life cycle carbon assessment (LCA) methodology\\nApple uses five steps when conducting a product LCA.\\n1. To model the manufacturing phase, we use part-by-part measurements of the entire product along with data on part production. The measurements help us accurately determine the size and weight of the components and materials in the product, while data on manufacturing processes and yield loss during production allows us to account for the impact of manufacturing. The LCA includes accessories, packaging, and units that are repaired and replaced through AppleCare.\\n2. To model customer use, we measure the power consumed by a product while it is running in a simulated scenario. Daily usage patterns are specific to each product and are a mixture of actual and modeled customer use data. For the purposes of our assessment, years of use, which are based on first owners, are modeled to be four years for macOS and tvOS devices and three years for iOS and watchOS devices. Most Apple products last longer and are passed along, resold, or returned to Apple by the first owner for others to use. More information on our product energy use is provided in our Product Environmental Reports.\\n3. To model transportation, we use data collected on shipments of single products and multipack units by land, sea, and air. We account for transporting materials between manufacturing sites; transporting products from manufacturing sites to regional distribution hubs; transporting products from regional distribution hubs to individual customers; and transporting products from final customers to recycling facilities.\\n4. To model recycling, we use material composition data on our products and cover the treatment steps carried out by the recycler to obtain metal, plastic, and glass material streams. Subsequent processing and remelting steps are not included, as these are considered stages of production and not endoflife processing.\\n5. After we collect data about production, use, transport, and recycling, we combine it with detailed greenhouse gas emission data. This emission data is based on a combination of Apple-specific and industry-average datasets for material production, manufacturing processes, electricity generation, and transportation. Renewable energy used in the supply chain, initiated by suppliers independently or through the Apple Supplier Clean Energy Program, are also accounted for. Combining product-specific data with emission data in our LCA tool allows us to compile detailed results for greenhouse gas emissions as they relate to the product. The data and modeling approaches are checked for quality and accuracy by the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany.\\nThere is inherent uncertainty in modeling carbon emissions due primarily to data limitations. For the top component contributors to Apple\\'s carbon emissions, Apple addresses this uncertainty by developing detailed process-based environmental models with Apple-specific parameters. For the remaining elements of Apple\\'s carbon footprint, we rely on industry average data and assumptions.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 57\\nScopes 1 and 2 Carbon Emissions Breakdown (metric tons COe)\\n\\nFiscal Year\\nLocation\\nCorporate Cupertino, CA Elk Grove, CA Austin, TX Other U.S. Cork, Ireland Singapore China Other International\\nData centers Maiden, NC Newark, CA Prineville, OR Reno, NV Mesa, AZ Viborg, Denmark Colocation facilities (U.S.)** Colocation facilities (International)**\\nRetail stores U.S. International\\nBusiness fleet\\nProcess emissions***\\nOther Scope 1 (Diesel, Propane, fugitive emissions)\\nTotals\\n\\nScope 1\\n29,980 24,720 630 320 1,350 890 30 200 1,840\\n60 30 0 20 0 10 -- N/A N/A\\n4,300 2,720 1,580\\n11,110\\n3,490\\n5,640\\n54,600\\n\\n2018\\nScope 2\\n7,980 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7,980\\n410 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 410\\n350 0 350\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n8,730\\n\\nScope 1\\n25,430 20,580 530 330 1,160 710 90 220 1,810\\n4,210 150 70 950 1,530 1,510 -- N/A N/A\\n4,920 2,490 2,430\\n8,300\\n2,540\\n--\\n45,400\\n\\n2017*\\nScope 2\\n33,290 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 33,290\\n1,520 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1,520\\n1,440 0 1,440\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n36,250\\n\\nScope 1\\n20,537 17,121 397 248 883 780 65 38 1,005\\n2,738 126 139 1,077 713 683 -- N/A N/A\\n3,679 1,597 2,082\\n7,370\\n--\\n--\\n34,324\\n\\n2016\\nScope 2\\n30,408 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 30,408\\n1,621 0 0 0 0 0 -- 0 1,621\\n8,920 0 8,920\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n40,953\\n\\nScope 1\\n15,415 13,248 369 233 121 892 0 117 435\\n13 0 0 13 0 -- -- N/A N/A\\n3,800 2,269 1,531\\n8,744\\n--\\n--\\n27,972\\n\\n2015\\nScope 2\\n19,564 0 0 0 0 0 3,767 2,201 13,596\\n0 0 0 0 0 -- -- -- --\\n22,893 0 22,893\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n42,457\\n\\nFiscal Year\\nLocation\\nCorporate Cupertino, CA Elk Grove, CA Austin, TX Other U.S. Cork, Ireland Singapore China Other International\\nData centers Maiden, NC Newark, CA Prineville, OR Reno, NV\\nRetail stores Domestic (U.S.) International\\nBusiness fleet\\nTotals\\n\\nScope 1\\n15,335 12,929 411 148 115 1,000 51 385 296\\n18 0 0 18 0\\n5,355 2,812 2,543\\n7,778\\n28,486\\n\\n2014\\nScope 2\\n21,555 0 0 0 0 0 6,852 8,577 6,126\\n0 0 0 0 0\\n41,658 11,036 30,662\\nN/A\\n63,213\\n\\nScope 1\\n13,727 10,747 509 83 337 743 50 390 868\\n2,201 2,201 0 0 0\\n6,158 3,548 2,610\\n7,214\\n29,300\\n\\n2013\\nScope 2\\n17,503 0 0 0 0 0 5,826 7,490 4,187\\n0 0 0 0 0\\n74,002 44,606 29,397\\nN/A\\n91,505\\n\\nScope 1\\n11,343 9,132 560 59 237 715 32 -- 609\\n146 146 0 0 0\\n2,812 787 2,025\\n6,923\\n21,224\\n\\n2012\\nScope 2\\n48,215 25,450 0 0 4,265 0 4,946 1,049 12,505\\n7,664 0 7,664 0 0\\n83,285 -- --\\nN/A\\n139,164\\n\\nScope 1\\n12,656 9,238 556 45 564 804 -- -- 1,449\\n0 0 0 -- --\\n2,600 746 1,854\\n6,400\\n21,656\\n\\n2011\\nScope 2\\n59,516 39,428 0 0 2,141 0 3,243 280 14,424\\n28,988 0 28,988 -- --\\n65,769 -- --\\nN/A\\n154,273\\n\\n-- Indicates that the energy source is not yet online.\\nScope 1 emissions result from natural gas use in buildings, and fuel use for fleet vehicles.

In fiscal year 2018, combustion of biogas for our fuel cells resulted in 41,040 metric tons of direct COe emissions. The biogas fuel cells are included in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions since they are within our operational control and their renewable certificates are matched with our data center load.

We\\'ve learned a lot about how best to secure renewable energy, which has helped us educate suppliers and expand our renewable energy efforts into our supply chain. This Facilities Renewable Energy Supplement summarizes the types of renewable energy solutions we\\'ve deployed, and details how we implement renewable energy at our data centers--our largest energy loads.\\nHow we secure renewable energy\\nSince launching our renewable energy program in 2011, we have implemented a number of solutions to procure renewable energy. Our strategy has evolved over time to create the most positive impact.\\nOwnership and PURPA. In 2011, Apple\\'s 100 percent equity ownership of our Maiden solar arrays was the first time a non-energy commercial company built its own utility-scale solar PV project. We used a 1978 federal law called the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) to structure the project. We then applied this same structure to two more large solar PV and biogas fuel cell projects in North Carolina and two micro-hydro projects in Oregon. This was a landmark moment in corporate renewable energy development and led to an increased use of PURPA in these states.\\nDirect Access. Since 2012, in California and Oregon, we\\'ve used a program called Direct Access to bypass the default electricity generation offered by the utilities servicing our data centers in those states. Instead, we contracted directly with independent power producers who could supply 100 percent renewable electricity. After initially buying from existing, third-party owned projects, we\\'re now procuring renewable energy from projects we created: The Solar Star II project delivers renewables to our Oregon data center, and the California Flats solar project to our data center in California.\\nGreen rider. In 2013, we opened a new data center in Reno, Nevada. With no PURPA or Direct Access options in Nevada, we worked directly with the local utility, NV Energy, to create a whole new regulatory structure. The \"Nevada Green Rider\" enables us to secure a long-term, fixedprice contract for renewable electricity from a new solar PV project built for us, but managed by the utility. We\\'ve used this partnership to create four solar projects totaling 320 megawatts.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 60\\nEquity investment. In 2014, we invested in two 20-megawatt solar PV projects in Sichuan, China to support all our in-country retail stores, corporate offices, and data storage facilities. This project represented the first time a commercial company created a new large-scale project in China for its own use. We\\'ve since replicated this model many times for Apple\\'s supply chain.\\nPortfolio solutions. In 2015 and 2016, we adapted to land scarcity constraints in Singapore and Japan by contracting for solar PV on 800 rooftops in Singapore and 300 in Japan. We adapted our approach in each country to fit local partnerships and regulatory structures: We signed a long-term agreement similar to a power purchase agreement in Singapore and made an equity investment in Japan. These projects offer us long-term flexibility as our load grows.\\nRenewable microgrid. Since 2017, we\\'ve been powering Apple Park with 100 percent renewable energy--about 75 percent of which is generated onsite and managed by a microgrid. The onsite generation comes from 14 megawatts of rooftop solar PV and 4 megawatts of baseload biogas fuel cells. Any additional energy required is drawn by Direct Access from the California Flats solar project in nearby Monterey County. The microgrid system with battery storage manages the renewable energy generation and the building\\'s energy use; optimizes demand management, load shifting, and frequency regulation services; and ensures uninterrupted energy reliability against local grid outages.\\nA focus on data centers\\nWe used over 1.3 billion kWh of electricity in fiscal year 2018 to power our data centers and colocation facilities around the world, representing over 60 percent of Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We\\'re proud that 100 percent of that electricity came from clean, renewable sources including solar, wind, biogas fuel cells, and low-impact hydro power. To cover our needs, we build our own renewable power projects and work with utilities to purchase clean energy from locally obtained resources. In fiscal year 2018, we avoided the equivalent of more than 466,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions by using 100 percent renewable energy for our data centers--that\\'s equivalent to taking almost 100,000 cars off the road for a year.1\\nWe\\'re staying at 100 percent even as Apple\\'s data center presence continues to grow. We now operate five data centers, and several more are being developed. These data centers are spread across North America, Europe, and Asia. Each has unique design features that conserve energy and reflect the climate, as well as other aspects, of its location.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\n1 G reenhouse gas equivalencies calculated using the U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator: http://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 61\\nSolar + Biogas Fuel Cells\\nMaiden, North Carolina\\nBetween 2011 and 2015, we installed 68 megawatts of Apple-created projects: two 20-megawatt solar projects, an 18-megawatt solar project, and 10 megawatts of biogas fuel cells. We then partnered with the local utility, Duke Energy, to help build five solar projects through its Green Source Rider program. These solar projects came online beginning in 2015 and were Duke Energy\\'s first Green Source Rider projects to become operational. We worked with Duke Energy for several years to develop this green energy tariff option, which allowed Apple and Duke Energy to work together to develop new renewable energy projects. The five projects have a combined capacity of 20 megawatts. In 2017, we made long-term commitments to five more solar projects in North Carolina, for an additional 86 megawatts of clean energy. In fiscal year 2018, the Maiden data center was supported by projects that generated 303 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the energy used by almost 24,000 North Carolina homes.2\\nEnergy efficiency measures we\\'ve implemented at our Maiden data centers include use of outside air cooling through a waterside economizer during night and cool-weather hours, which, along with water storage, allows the chillers to be idle 75 percent of the time.\\n\\nMaiden, North Carolina--100% renewable since opening June 2010\\n\\n303 million kWh energy use in fiscal year 2018\\n\\nDuke Energy Default Grid Mix\\n\\nApple Actual Renewable Energy Use\\n\\nNuclear\\n\\n51% Apple\\'s Solar Projects\\n\\n38%\\n\\nCoal\\n\\n33% Apple\\'s Biogas Fuel Cells\\n\\n24%\\n\\nOther\\n\\n16% Duke Green Source Rider\\n\\n12%\\n\\n(100% solar)\\n\\nRenewable\\n\\n<1% NC GreenPower (100% solar)\\n\\n14%\\n\\nOther Solar Contracts\\n\\n12%\\n\\n2018 Default Emissions\\n\\n110,910 2018 Effective Emissions\\n\\n0\\n\\n(mtons COe/year)\\n\\n(mtons COe/year)\\n\\nFrom Duke Energy Carolinas 2015 Statistical Supplement generation data\\n\\nActual fiscal year 2018 energy data\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\n2 C arbon emissions equivalences calculated using U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2017 data: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf.\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 62\\nWind + Solar + Low-Impact Hydro\\nPrineville, Oregon\\nTo support our Prineville data center, we recently signed a 200-megawatt power purchase agreement for a new Oregon wind farm, the Montague Wind Power Facility, set to come online later in 2019. It\\'s our largest project to date, producing over 560 million kWh of clean, renewable energy a year.\\nAdditionally, we executed a power purchase agreement for the 56-megawatt Solar Star Oregon II project located just a few miles from our data center. This solar PV project, which came online and began supporting the data center in 2017, produces 140 million kWh of renewable energy a year. To strengthen the connection between Apple and these projects, we use Oregon\\'s Direct Access program to supply the renewable energy from these projects directly to our data center.\\nAlso supporting the data center are two micro-hydro projects that harness the power of water flowing through local irrigation canals that have been operating for over 60 years. These microhydro projects generate about 7 to 10 million kWh of renewable energy a year.\\nTo supplement these projects, we executed a long-term purchase agreement for all environmental attributes from a 50-megawatt portfolio of six solar projects in Oregon.\\nIn fiscal year 2018, the Prineville data center was supported by projects that generated 252 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the energy used by 21,670 Oregon homes.2\\nOur Prineville data center takes advantage of the cool and dry climate by cooling the servers with outside air whenever possible.

So, in 2013, we created a partnership with the local utility, NV Energy, to develop the Fort Churchill Solar project. Apple designed, financed, and constructed the project, and NV Energy operates it and directs all the renewable energy it produces to our data center. The Fort Churchill Solar project uses a photovoltaic panel with curved mirrors that concentrate sunlight. The 20-megawatt array has an annual production capacity of over 43 million kWh.\\nTo facilitate further renewable development in Nevada, Apple worked with NV Energy and the Nevada utility commission to create a green energy option open to all commercial customers, called the Nevada Green Rider, that does not require the customer to fund project development up-front. Thanks to this new option, in 2015 we announced our second Nevada solar project, the 50-megawatt Boulder Solar II project. This project came online in 2017, producing 137 million kWh of renewable energy a year.\\nWe have used the Nevada Green Rider two more times, first for the 200-megawatt Techren Solar II project. Apple\\'s largest solar project to date, it is estimated to produce over 540 million kWh when it comes online later this year. Next was the 50-megawatt Turquoise Nevada project, estimated to produce 110 million kWh a year and come online in 2020.\\nIn fiscal year 2018, the Reno data center was supported by projects that generated 253 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the energy used by 24,690 Nevada homes.2\\nLike in Prineville, our Reno data center takes advantage of the mild climate by cooling the servers with outside air whenever possible.

As our loads grow over time, we\\'ll continue working with our colocation suppliers to match 100 percent of our energy use with renewables.\\nFurthermore, we worked with one of our main suppliers of colocation services to help it develop the capability to provide renewable energy solutions to its customers. This partnership advances Apple\\'s renewable energy program and those of other companies that use this colocation provider.\\n\\nEnergy Use and Emissions at Apple\\'s Colocation Facilities\\n\\nFY2011 FY2012 FY2013 FY2014 FY2015 FY20164 FY2017 FY2018\\n\\nTotal Energy Use (kWh) 42,500\\n38,552,300 79,462,900 108,659,700 142,615,000 145,520,900 289,195,800 327,663,800\\n\\nRenewable Energy (kWh) 0\\n1,471,680 46,966,900 88,553,400 121,086,100 143,083,200 286,378,100 326,959,700\\n\\nDefault Utility Emissions1\\n(metric tons CO2e) 10\\n17,200 31,800 44,300 60,500 66,300 125,600 146,600\\n\\nApple\\'s Emissions-- Including Renewable\\nEnergy2 (metric tons CO2e)\\n10\\n16,500\\n14,500\\n11,000\\n12,700\\n1,600\\n1,500\\n400\\n\\nPercent Renewable Energy3 0% 4% 59% 81% 85% 98% 99% 99.8%\\n\\n1 We calculate \"default utility emissions\" to provide baseline emissions of what our carbon footprint would have been without the use of renewable energy.

Beginning January 1, 2018, all of the electricity use at our colocation facilities is from 100 percent renewable energy.\\n4 Over the past two years, we have been installing submeters in colocation facilities to better track electricity usage. Beginning in FY2016, we started reporting this submetered electricity usage. Prior to fiscal year 2016, reported electricity usage was conservatively estimated based on maximum contract capacity quantities. We\\'ve updated our fiscal year 2016 colocation facilities footprint to reflect more accurately Apple\\'s operational boundaries. Per the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol, we\\'ve removed from our electricity usage and Scope 2 calculations those emissions associated with colocation facility cooling and building operations.\\n\\nRegional Energy Use at Apple\\'s Colocation Facilities\\n\\nU.S. Europe APAC FY2018 Total\\n\\nTotal Energy Use (kWh)\\n244,376,400 30,831,400 52,456,000\\n327,663,800\\n\\nRenewable Energy (kWh)\\n244,376,400 30,114,500 52,368,800\\n326,859,700\\n\\nPercent Renewable Energy 100% 98% 100% 99.8%\\n\\nBeyond the use of our own data centers and colocation facilities, we also use third-party computing services to support some of our on-demand cloud storage-based services.

This review and verification focuses on Scope 3 emissions for products sold by Apple Inc. (as defined by WRI/WBCSD/Greenhouse Gas Protocol  Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard). It is noted that emissions relating to the facilities that are owned or leased by Apple (scope 1 and 2 emissions) as well as business travel and employee commute were subject to a separate third party verification and are therefore excluded from the scope of this statement. Confidential data relating to product sales and shipments were also excluded from the scope of this verification.\\nThis review and verification covers Apple\\'s annual greenhouse gas emissions and does not replace reviews conducted for individual product LCAs for greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). The life cycle emissions data produced by Apple for individual products has been calculated in accordance to the standard ISO 14040/14044: Environmental management  Life cycle assessment  Principles and framework / Requirements and guidelines. This review and verification furthermore complies with ISO 14064-3: Greenhouse gases -- Part 3: Specification with guidance for the validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions.\\nThe review of the annual carbon footprint has considered the following criteria:\\n The system, boundaries and functional unit are clearly defined\\n Assumptions and estimations made are appropriate\\n Selection of primary and secondary data is appropriate and methodologies used\\nare adequately disclosed\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\nComprehensive Carbon Footprint Letter of Assurance Client: Apple Inc.\\n\\n1\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 72\\nThese criteria are also fundamental to the review of LCAs conducted for individual product emissions. The reviewers note that the largest share (98%) of Apple Inc. annual carbon footprint is comprised of scope 3 emissions from individual products. The aforementioned criteria have been regularly reviewed by Fraunhofer IZM since 2007 with a view to providing independent feedback that can facilitate continuous improvement and refinement in the LCA methodology applied by Apple Inc.\\n\\nData reported by Apple is as follows:\\n\\nManufacturing Transportation Product Use\\n\\n2018\\n\\n18.49\\n\\n1.33\\n\\n4.65\\n\\n[MMT CO2e]\\n\\n[MMT CO2e]\\n\\n[MMT CO2e]\\n\\nMMT CO2e: million metric tons carbon dioxide equivalents\\n\\nRecycling\\n0.05\\n[MMT CO2e]\\n\\nIncluding a reported value of 0.58 million metric tons CO2e for facilities (out of scope of this verification), total comprehensive carbon footprint is reported to be 25.2 million metric tons CO2e.\\n\\nApple\\'s comprehensive carbon footprint includes an increasing amount of greenhouse gas emissions reductions for manufacturing resulting from Apple renewable energy projects, supplier renewable electricity purchases, and supplier renewable electricity installations. These reductions are part of Apple\\'s Clean Energy Program. Fraunhofer IZM has not verified these emissions reductions.\\n\\nBased on the process and procedures conducted, there is no evidence that the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) assertion with regards to scope 3 carbon footprint\\n\\n is not materially correct and is not a fair representation of GHG data and\\ninformation, and\\n\\n has not been prepared in accordance with the related International Standard on\\nGHG quantification, monitoring and reporting.\\n\\n2 Reviewed Data and Plausibility Check\\n\\nA verification and sampling plan as required by ISO 14046-3 has been established for the comprehensive carbon footprint review and verification, defining the level of assurance, objectives, criteria, scope and materiality of the verification.\\nAs part of this review and verification Apple disclosed following data to Fraunhofer IZM:\\n Sales data for FY2018, including accessories and including AppleCare, Apple\\'s\\nextended warranty and technical support plans for their devices.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\nComprehensive Carbon Footprint Letter of Assurance Client: Apple Inc.\\n\\n2\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 73\\n Product specific data on transportation including breakdown of air and sea\\nshipment\\n Life cycle GHG emissions for all products, differentiating the actual product\\nconfigurations (e.g. memory capacity)\\n Calculation methodology for the comprehensive carbon footprint and\\nmethodological changes implemented in 2018\\n The total carbon footprint  scope 3 for the fiscal year 2018\\n Detailed analysis of the comprehensive carbon footprint including:\\no The breakdown of the carbon footprint into life cycle phases manufacturing, transportation, product use and recycling\\no Detailed product specific split into life cycle phases o The contribution of individual products and product families to the overall\\ncarbon footprint\\nThe data and information supporting the GHG assertion were projected (use phase and recycling) and historical (i.e. fiscal year 2018 data regarding sales figures, manufacturing, transportation).\\nThis review comprises a check of selected data, which are most influential to the overall carbon footprint. The overall plausibility check addressed the following questions:\\n Are product LCAs referenced correctly?\\n Are results for products, for which no full LCA review was undertaken, plausible?\\n Are carbon emission data for individual products plausible in the light of\\nmethodological changes as indicated by Apple?\\nThis review was done remotely.\\n3 Findings\\nIn FY2018 and beginning of FY2019 10 recent product LCA studies have been reviewed successfully against ISO 14040/44. These LCAs cover product segments MacBook Pro, iMac, Apple Watch, Homepod and iPhone. These recently reviewed LCA studies cover products which represent in total 44,9% of the total scope 3 carbon footprint. Representatives of other product segments (iPod, iPad, Mac Pro, Mac Mini, Airport Express\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSmarter Chemistry\\n\\nBetter Together\\n\\nComprehensive Carbon Footprint Letter of Assurance Client: Apple Inc.\\n\\n3\\n\\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 74\\n/ Airport Extreme, Apple TV, and Beats products) underwent no or only minor design changes compared to those which went through a full LCA review in former years. All reviewed LCA studies up to now cover in total 67,9% of the total scope 3 carbon footprint.\\nAll questions raised in the course of the review were answered by Apple and related evidence was provided where needed.\\n\\n4 Conclusions\\nApple\\' assessment approach is excellent in terms of granularity of the used calculation data. A significant share of components is modelled with accurate primary data from Apple\\'s suppliers.\\nFor all product LCA calculations, where exact data was missing, the principle of a worstcase approach has been followed and results have been calculated with rather conservative estimates.\\nThe review has not found assumptions or calculation errors on the carbon footprint data level that indicate the scope 3 carbon footprint has been materially misstated. The excellent analysis meets the principles of good scientific practice.\\nBerlin, April 3, 2019\\n\\n- Karsten Schischke Fraunhofer IZM Dept.

Climate change is a pressing global issue that poses an imminent threat to our planet. In 2018 alone, we experienced unprecedented heat waves, wildfires, and flooding in California, along with many other extreme weather events around the world. It\\'s clear that immediate action must be taken on a global scale if the impacts of climate change are to be mitigated and, ideally, reversed.\\nGoogle has a longstanding commitment to climate action and environmental stewardship. Sustainability has been a core value since Google\\'s founding, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. In 2018, we achieved twelve consecutive years of carbon neutrality and, for the second year in a row, matched 100% of the electricity consumption of our global operations with renewable energy. We also announced our longterm goal to power our operations with carbon-free energy, 24x7, 365 days a year.\\nWe\\'re exploring the role of artificial intelligence in helping us achieve even greater energy efficiency gains in our data centers, and we\\'re prioritizing the use of healthy materials with safe chemistry across Google\\'s built spaces. Beyond Google\\'s operations, we\\'re expanding access to the benefits of technology through energy-saving initiatives like the Nest Power Project. We\\'re also working closely with partners to develop tools for policymakers, planners, and researchers that will enable better-informed decisions and actions, like the Environmental Insights Explorer, which provides city-level carbon emissions data.\\nIn the years to come, we\\'ll focus on how Google can accelerate the transition toward carbon-free energy and a circular economy, empower everyone with technology that enables sustainable action, and benefit the communities where we operate.\\nGoogle remains steadfast in its commitment to sustainability, and we will continue to look for collaborative partnerships and innovative opportunities to help create a clean and healthy planet for everyone.\\n\\nRuth Porat\\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nUrs Hlzle\\nSenior Vice President of Technical Infrastructure\\n\\n2\\nAbout Google\\nAs our founders explained in their first letter to shareholders, Google\\'s goal is to \"develop services that significantly improve the lives of as many people as possible.\"1 We believe in technology\\'s potential to have a positive impact on the world. We also believe we\\'re just scratching the surface. Our vision is to remain a place of incredible creativity and innovation that uses our technical expertise to tackle big problems.\\nWe generate revenues primarily by delivering both performance advertising and brand advertising. Google\\'s core products--Android, Chrome, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube--each have more than 1 billion monthly active users.\\nWe also offer a broad collection of cloud-based products and services, including G Suite business productivity apps like Docs, Drive, and Calendar and satellite mapping and analysis platforms like Google Earth and Google Earth Engine. In recent years we\\'ve expanded into consumer electronics with products including Chromecast, Google Home, Google Nest Hub, Google Pixel, and Google Pixelbook.\\nWe\\'re a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., which had $136.8 billion in total revenues in 2018 and 98,771 full-time employees as of December 31, 2018.2\\nGoogle\\'s global headquarters are located in Mountain View, California, United States. We also have significant operations in Sunnyvale as well as operations in other cities throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, including San Francisco, San Bruno, and Palo Alto. In this report the term \"Bay Area headquarters\" refers to our operations in both Mountain View and Sunnyvale. We own and lease office and building space, as well as research and development sites, across more than 150 cities, primarily in North America, Europe, South America, and Asia, and we own and operate 15 data centers across four continents.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\n3\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nAbout this report\\nThe annual data in this report covers our 2018 fiscal year (January 1 to December 31, 2018). The spotlights may also include data and stories from prior years to provide context, as well as some of our progress in 2019. Unless otherwise specified, all environmental performance data included in this report applies to Google LLC. The primary exception is our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy use data, which covers the combined operations of Google and our Other Bets and has been third-party verified.\\nFor more information about our environmental sustainability initiatives, including case studies, white papers, and blogs, please see our Sustainability website. Google\\'s \"Our Commitments\" website highlights our work across five areas: Protecting Users, Expanding Opportunity, Including All Voices, Responding to Crises, and Advancing Sustainability. Our Commitments Reports database includes all our public reports on these topics, and our environmental-focused reports can be found in our Sustainability Reports database.

Fulfilling this mission, and bringing the benefits of information not just to the more than 3 billion people who are already online but to the next 4 billion, requires us to use resources ever more efficiently.3\\nThe path to a cleaner, healthier future begins with the small decisions we make each day. That\\'s why we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. We\\'re raising the bar in making smart use of Earth\\'s resources, expecting the highest ethical standards throughout our supply chain, and creating products with people and the planet in mind. We\\'re also constantly looking for ways to have a positive environmental impact and be even more responsible in our use of energy, water, and other natural resources--and we want to help others to do the same.\\nThis ambition is reflected across our value chain. Our data centers lead the industry in energy efficiency--they\\'re twice as efficient as the industry average for enterprise data centers. We\\'ve been carbon neutral since 2007, and now for the second year in a row, we\\'ve matched 100% of the electricity our operations use with renewables. This same ethos carries over to our workplaces, with over 1.2 million square meters (13 million square feet) of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified offices, and to our products. Whether\\n\\nOur approach\\n\\n6\\nBy the end of 2018, Nest thermostats had helped customers cumulatively save more than\\n29billion\\nkWh of energy.\\n\\nsomeone is using Google at home or as part of an organization running Google Cloud or G Suite, all of the products in our Cloud are carbon neutral. As we continue to grow, we\\'re on a journey to make our Made by Google consumer electronics products work for people and the planet.\\nOur tools are built to help everyone reduce their environmental impact, understand the planet, and take sustainable action. By mapping the world\\'s forests and fisheries, our technology is making it easier for policymakers, researchers, and nonprofits to monitor the pulse of the planet. We\\'re also making it easier for everyone to take sustainable action by providing more than 1 billion kilometers (km) (621 million miles) of alternative transit options through Google Maps every day and by helping people reduce their home energy consumption with Nest thermostats, which have helped customers cumulatively save more than 29 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy.\\nAddressing a global challenge\\nHumanity is consuming natural resources at an astonishing rate. During the 20th century, global raw material use rose at about twice the rate of population growth.4 Every year humanity consumes far more than what the planet can naturally replenish. In 2018, global demand for resources was 1.7 times what the Earth\\'s ecosystems can regenerate in a year.5\\nThese statistics highlight the need to rethink the \"take-make-waste\" economic model that human societies have followed since the Industrial Revolution, in which we take a natural resource, make a product from it or burn it for fuel, and eventually send what remains to the landfill as waste. The consequences of this model have created some of the most significant challenges of our time, including climate change, extreme weather events, and plastic pollution, among others.\\nClimate change is one of the most significant global challenges of our time, and continued greenhouse gas emissions pose an existential threat to humanity. The science behind this is clear, and recent reports have stressed the urgency of the issue. In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a special report addressing the need for rapid transition and widespread action in the next 12 years if we are to limit global warming to the 1.5 degree Celsius warming scenario.6 Given this pressing time horizon, it\\'s now more important than ever for governments, businesses, and individuals around the world to take immediate and ambitious action on climate at a global scale. We believe that Google\\'s scale, resources, and technological expertise can help the world meet its energy and resource needs in a responsible way that drives innovation and growth.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nOur approach\\n\\n7\\nGoogle\\'s data center in Eemshaven, Netherlands\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nTaking action\\nWith millions more people coming online every month, the demand for computing power continues to skyrocket and data center capacity continues to expand to meet this need. But despite this growth, the total amount of electricity used by U.S. data centers has remained constant. Annual consumption increased by 90% from 2000 to 2005, but only by 4% from 2010 to 2014, largely due to data centers\\' ability to improve their efficiency as they scale.7 As the use of mobile devices increases and more IT users transition to public clouds, we believe our industry can and must do better than just holding the line on energy use. We can actually lower it, serving more users while using fewer resources.\\nGoogle\\'s energy consumption drives our biggest impact on the environment. Internally, we\\'re focused on tackling it through a threefold strategy for carbon neutrality. Beyond Google, we\\'ve long been a vocal advocate for greening electrical grids worldwide. We support strong cleanenergy and climate-change policies committed to adding clean power to the grid, and we\\'re partnering with governments and nongovernmental organizations to use Google technology to model the effects of climate change on both a global and a local level.\\n\\nOur approach\\n\\n8\\nOur sustainability goals, like committing to match the electricity use for our operations with 100% renewable energy, not only are good for the environment but also make good business sense. By purchasing electricity from renewable sources like wind and solar, we can set a long-term fixed price for power. This allows us to gain access to an increasingly costcompetitive source of electricity, and it helps us save money in the long run. By the end of 2018, we had contracts to purchase more than 3.75 gigawatts (GW) of output from renewable energy projects. These contracts have led to nearly $5 billion in new capital investment in projects around the world.8\\nWe\\'re also working to incorporate a climate-resilience strategy into our operations that will enable our business and the communities we\\'re part of to thrive despite the effects of climate change. The key principles that serve as the foundation for our strategy are focused on a people-centric framework that\\'s robust, integrated, diverse, and designed with unique locations, scalability, and longevity in mind.9 This framework was used to conduct a climate exposure and vulnerability analysis that enabled us to assess the future resilience of our current locations and evaluate the climate resilience of new developments. Beyond our operations, Google\\'s AI for Social Good program and Crisis Response platforms are using our technology to enhance flood forecasting models that provide predictions to inform individuals in affected areas so that they can better prepare and stay safe.\\n\\nCharleston Retention Basin on the edge of Google\\'s campus in Mountain View, California\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nOur approach\\n\\n9\\nOur goal is to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains and enable others to do the same.\\n\\nWater is another top priority. The United Nations predicts that by 2025, two-thirds of the world\\'s population could live in water-stressed conditions, and with the existing climate change scenario, almost half the world\\'s population will be living in areas of high water stress by 2030.10 As a global company headquartered in drought-prone California, we\\'ve established a set of water principles to guide our approach to water use and ensure business continuity, especially in the places where we have the greatest potential risk. Under these principles, we\\'re working to utilize water efficiently, exploring ways to incorporate circularity, and engaging in partnerships that use Google technology to raise awareness of water-related risks and opportunities and to create platforms that help everyone study and understand global water challenges. Examples of sustainable water management practices can be seen in our data centers, where we keep working to find innovative cooling options where possible, like the use of seawater in Finland, industrial canal water in Belgium, and air cooling in Ireland. Through Google.org, we\\'ve awarded millions of dollars in grants to promising water-conservation solutions.11\\nWe see the circular economy as a complex yet inspiring information challenge that, once unlocked, will lead to a world of abundance where human, environmental, and economic systems can thrive. That\\'s why we\\'re leveraging our scale, resources, technological expertise, and close partnerships with organizations like the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, as well as with other leading companies, to accelerate the transition to a circular economy and help the world meet its resource needs.\\nUltimately, our goal is to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains and enable others to do the same. We\\'re applying our circular economy principles to design out waste, keep products and materials in use, and promote healthy materials and safe chemistry. We strive to embed these principles across our infrastructure, operations, and products, from how we manage servers in our data centers to how we design our consumer electronics to the materials we select to build and furnish our offices. As we work toward this goal, we\\'ll continue exploring the role of technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in accelerating our transition to becoming a circular Google that contributes to a sustainable world.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nOur approach\\n\\n10\\nFigure 1\\nGOOGLE VALUE CHAIN\\nEnergy\\n\\nSetting our priorities\\nGoogle uses energy, natural resources, and products and services from our suppliers to build our workplaces, data centers, networking infrastructure, and consumer electronics. The software products and services that our customers and users rely on are powered by our data centers and networking infrastructure (see Figure 1). We\\'re driving positive environmental impact throughout our value chain in five key ways: by designing efficient data centers, advancing carbon-free energy, creating sustainable workplaces, building better devices and services, and empowering users with technology.\\nIn 2018, we undertook an assessment to identify and prioritize content for our environmental report that considered Google\\'s impact on sustainability, the importance of environmental sustainability issues to our business strategy, and the perspectives of a diverse range of stakeholders outside of Google. The issue areas that were found to be of greatest relevance include our data centers, workplaces, users, water stewardship, circular economy strategy, and supply chain. Cutting across these priorities is the importance of engaging in public policy--at local, state, federal, and international levels-- to support the success of sustainable business models.\\nAs per recommendations from the Financial Stability Board\\'s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, we have reported our exposure to climate-related risks over multiple time horizons in Alphabet\\'s 2019 CDP Climate Change Report.\\n\\nOffices and Research/Development Sites\\n\\nConsumer Electronics and Services\\n\\nNatural Resources\\n\\nManufacturing, Construction, and\\nServices\\n\\nData Centers and Networking Infrastructure\\n\\nGoogle Cloud Platform, G Suite Products, and Tools\\n\\nSuppliers and Communities\\n\\nEmployees and Communities Ecosystems\\n\\nCustomers and Users\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nOur approach\\n\\n11\\nLooking toward future opportunities\\nWe believe global businesses like Google should lead the way in improving people\\'s lives, while reducing or even eliminating our dependence on raw materials and fossil fuels. And we believe this can be done in a way that makes business sense, providing economic returns alongside societal benefits and positive environmental impacts.\\nPlanning for the future, we\\'ve established a five-year strategy that will enable us to continue building sustainability into everything we do (see Figure 2). Our strategy focuses on three key pillars: to accelerate the transition to carbon-free energy and a circular economy, to empower users with technology, and to benefit the people and places where we operate. We\\'re continuing to work to decouple our business growth from the growth of material use and carbon intensity. This includes enhancing our net positive impact through initiatives that help our users reduce carbon emissions, save energy, and use resources more sustainably. We also want to ensure that Google products, tools, and platforms inform or enable sustainability, and that we\\'re implementing practices to add value to our communities within and outside of Google.\\nCreating Google tools that help people measure the planet\\'s health and take action is a key part of our long-term strategy. Applications of machine learning (ML) and AI are increasingly enabling not only Google but also scientists and practitioners to create sustainable solutions and to turn data into insights and knowledge needed to guide better decision-making. We\\'re excited to continue exploring how these technologies and applications can be used to create a more sustainable future for generations to come--and we\\'re committed to using these technologies in a responsible way.12\\nFigure 2\\nFIVE-YEAR SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY OVERVIEW\\nWe strive to build sustainability into everything we do\\n\\nAccelerate carbon-free and circular\\nDecouple business growth from growth of carbon\\nintensity and material use\\n\\nEmpower with technology\\nGoogle products, tools, and platforms inform or enable sustainability\\n\\nBenefit people and places\\nShare benefits with communities where we operate\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nOur approach\\n\\n12\\nPerformance highlights and targets\\nThe following section includes highlights of the environmental initiatives discussed in this report.

We own and operate 15 data centers13 on four continents and continue to add new sites to better serve our customers. Each data center is a large campus where the vast majority of our facilities, servers, networking equipment, and cooling systems are designed from the ground up for maximum efficiency and minimal environmental impact.\\nFor more than a decade, we\\'ve worked to make Google data centers some of the most efficient in the world, improving their environmental performance even as demand for our products has dramatically risen. We\\'ve done this by designing, building, and operating each one to maximize efficient use of energy, water, and materials.\\nTo reduce energy use, we strive to build the world\\'s most energy-efficient computing network by squeezing more out of every watt of power we consume. First, we outfit each data center with high-performance servers that we\\'ve custom designed to use as little energy as possible. We improve facility energy use by installing smart temperature and lighting controls and redesigning how power is distributed to reduce energy loss. We employ advanced cooling techniques, relying primarily on energy-efficient evaporative cooling, and use nonpotable water at some sites. Finally, we\\'re applying machine learning to drive energy efficiency even further.\\nOur efforts have paid off: On average, a Google data center is twice as energy efficient as a typical enterprise data center.15 Compared with five years ago, we now deliver around seven times as much computing power with the same amount of electrical power. Much of this improvement has come from new innovations with accelerators, such as our Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)--highly efficient computer chips we designed specifically for machine learning applications.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nDesigning efficient data centers\\n\\n19\\nIn 2018, the average annual power usage effectiveness (PUE)16 for our global fleet of data centers was 1.11, compared with the industry average of 1.6717-- meaning that Google data centers use about six times less overhead energy (11%) for every unit of IT equipment energy (see Figure 3). We aim to maintain or improve our quarterly PUE at each Google data center, year over year. Our fleet-wide PUE has stayed at or below 1.12 since 2013 (see Figure 4).\\nGenerating electricity requires water, so the less energy we use to power our data centers, the less water we use as well. The source of energy matters too: Wind and solar energy require considerably less water to produce than do coal and nuclear energy. In 2018, matching our data center electricity consumption with renewable energy reduced embedded water use by 88% on average compared with buying grid power.\\n\\nFigure 3\\nOVERHEAD ENERGY USE IN GOOGLE DATA CENTERS l Overhead energy as % of IT energy\\n-- 20\\n\\n-- 15\\n\\n11%\\n\\n-- 10\\n\\n0\\n\\n2008\\n\\n2009\\n\\n2010\\n\\n2011\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2018\\n\\nPUE PERCENT\\n\\nFigure 4\\nAVERAGE PUE FOR ALL DATA CENTERS Quarterly PUE Trailing 12-month (TTM) PUE\\n1.26 --\\n\\n1.22 --\\n\\n1.18 --\\n\\n1.14 --\\n\\n1.10 --\\n\\n2009\\n\\n2010\\n\\n2011\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2018\\n\\n1.11 1.11\\n2019\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nDesigning efficient data centers\\n\\n20\\nGoogle\\'s data center in Saint-Ghislain, Belgium\\nIn 2013, we became the first company in North America--and the only major internet company--to achieve a multi-site energy management system certification to ISO 50001, a voluntary third-party standard. Our energy management system intends to cover all of our owned data centers globally once they meet certain operational milestones. In 2018, we maintained ISO 50001 certification for 12 of our 15 Google-owned and -operated data centers, which together represented 91% of our IT energy use.18\\nWe\\'re also working to design out waste, embedding circular economy principles into our server management by reusing materials multiple times. In 2018, 19% of components used for machine upgrades were refurbished inventory. When we can\\'t find a new use for our equipment, we completely erase any components that stored data and then resell them. In 2018, we resold nearly 3.5 million units into the secondary market for reuse by other organizations.\\nWe\\'re committed to achieving Zero Waste to Landfill19 for our global data center operations by reducing the amount of waste we generate and finding better disposal options. In 2018, we diverted 87% of waste from our global data center operations away from landfills.\\nIn addition to driving efficiency in our data center operations, we also consider supply chain impacts. Through the efforts of our Responsible Supply Chain program, we collaborate with stakeholders across our supply chain to uphold our high standards for protecting workers and the environment.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nDesigning efficient data centers\\n\\n21\\nFrom 2007 to 2017, Google\\'s data center investments in Europe supported economic activity with\\n490\\nmillion per year in GDP.\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nOur Supplier Code of Conduct builds upon Google\\'s core values and beliefs and incorporates key elements from the Google Code of Conduct and international human rights, safety, and environmental standards.\\nGoogle has saved more than $1 billion through our energy-efficiency initiatives and hundreds of millions more through resource efficiency. By sharing our best practices and supporting research and collaboration, we hope to help other companies realize their own savings and promote ever-greater data center sustainability worldwide.\\nGoogle\\'s investment in digital infrastructure, such as data centers, also supports sustainable growth and creates economic opportunity. In 2016, Google\\'s U.S. data centers generated $1.3 billion in economic activity, $750 million in labor income, and 11,000 jobs.20 From 2007 to 2017, Google\\'s data center investments in Europe supported economic activity with 490 million per year in gross domestic product (GDP) and 6,600 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs per year, on average.21\\nCarbon-neutral cloud services\\nGoogle Cloud Platform and G Suite products like Gmail, Docs, and Drive are enabling millions of businesses to shift computing needs from self-managed data centers or colocation facilities to Google Cloud\\'s highly efficient, renewable energybased computing infrastructure. Businesses that switch to cloud-based products like G Suite have reported reductions in IT energy use and carbon emissions up to 87%,22 and a business using Gmail can reduce the GHG emissions impact of its email service by up to 98%, compared with running email via onpremises servers.23 Individual users also benefit, since providing an active user one month of Google services creates fewer GHG emissions than driving a car one mile.24 Whether someone is using Google at home or as part of an organization running Google Cloud or G Suite, all of the products in our Cloud are carbon neutral.\\nLEARN MORE 2016 case study: Circular Economy at Work in Google Data Centers 2018 spotlight: Once Is Never Enough 2018 spotlight: Putting Down Local Roots Where Google\\'s European Data Centers Are Growing 2018 spotlight: Belgian site becomes first Google data center to add on-site solar 2018 blog: Engineered for renewal: Google Cloud, Etsy and sustainability 2018 report: European Data Centers: Economic Impact and Community Benefit 2018 report: U.S. Data Centers: Economic Impact and Community Benefit Website: Google Data Centers: Efficiency: How We Do It Website: Google Cloud Sustainability Website: Google Cloud Renewable Energy Website: Responsible Supply Chain\\n\\nDesigning efficient data centers\\n\\n22\\nSpotlight\\nAutomated AI takes Google data center efficiency to next level\\nIn 2016, we jointly developed an AI-powered recommendation system to improve the energy efficiency of Google\\'s already highly-optimized data centers. Now we\\'re taking this system to the next level: instead of humanimplemented recommendations, our AI system is directly controlling data center cooling, while remaining under the expert supervision of our data center operators. This first-of-its-kind cloud-based control system is now safely delivering energy savings in multiple Google data centers.\\nWhereas our original recommendation system had operators vetting and implementing actions, our new AI control system directly implements the actions. We\\'ve purposefully constrained the system\\'s optimization boundaries to a narrower operating regime to prioritize safety and reliability, meaning there is a risk/reward trade off in terms of energy reductions.\\nDespite being in place for only a matter of months, the system is already delivering consistent energy savings of around 30 percent on average, with further expected improvements. That\\'s because these systems get better over time with more data. Our direct AI control system is finding yet more novel ways to manage cooling that have surprised even the data center operators. Dan Fuenffinger, one of Google\\'s data center operators who has worked extensively alongside the system, remarked: \"It was amazing to see the AI learn to take advantage of winter conditions and produce colder than normal water, which reduces the energy required for cooling within the data center. Rules don\\'t get better over time, but AI does.\"\\nWe\\'re excited that our direct AI control system is operating safely and dependably, while consistently delivering energy savings. However, data centers are just the beginning. In the long term, we think there\\'s potential to apply this technology in other industrial settings, and help tackle climate change on an even grander scale.

And combating climate change requires the world to transition to a clean energy economy. So we\\'ve made it a top priority to become more energy efficient and to match every unit of energy we consume at our facilities around the world with an equivalent unit of energy from renewable sources, such as wind and solar. Our support for clean energy goes hand in hand with reducing our carbon footprint. By improving the efficiency of our operations and buying both renewable power and high-quality carbon offsets, we\\'ve been carbon neutral since 2007.\\nGoogle is the world\\'s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy.25 Since 2010, we\\'ve signed 34 agreements to purchase a total of more than 3.75 GW of renewable energy that is new to the grid (see Figure 5).26 On July 27, 2015, as part of the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, Google committed to tripling our purchases of renewable energy from 1.1 GW to 3.4 GW by 2025. We surpassed this in 2018, exceeding our target seven years early.\\nIn 2012, we set a long-term goal to purchase enough renewable energy to match all the electricity we consume globally on an annual basis. In 2017, we achieved it for the first time: Google\\'s total purchase of energy from sources like wind and solar matched the amount of electricity used by our operations around the world, including our offices and data centers. And in 2018, we again matched 100% of our annual electricity consumption with purchases of renewable energy (see Figure 6). This amounted to more than 10 million megawatt-hours (MWh) of energy--more electricity than is used annually by the state of Hawaii.27 To date, we\\'ve purchased a total of nearly 26 million MWh of renewable energy.\\nWe\\'re the first company of our size to achieve 100% renewable energy two years running.28 While we\\'re still drawing power from the grid, some of which is from fossil fuel resources, we\\'re purchasing enough renewable energy to match every MWh of electricity our data center and office operations consume.\\nOur long-term goal is to source carbon-free energy to match our electricity consumption in all places, at all times. This means realizing a future where each Google facility is always matched--around the clock--with local carbon-free power. Our ultimate vision is to create a world where everyone has access to clean energy; this includes not only Google, but our suppliers and their communities.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\\n\\n25\\nMidAmerican Energy Wind VIII 407 MW\\nStory County II 114 MW\\nCimarron Bend 200 MW\\n\\nGolden Hills 43 MW\\nBluestem 198 MW\\n\\n400 MW 200 MW 100 MW\\n\\nBethel 225 MW\\n\\nDakota Range 300 MW\\nCoyote Ridge 98 MW\\nTatanka 98 MW\\nGlaciers Edge 200 MW\\nDuke Rider 75 MW\\nCanadian Hills 48 MW\\n\\nMaevaara l Maevaara ll\\n\\n72 MW\\n\\n33 MW\\n\\nTellenes\\n\\nLehtirova 103 MW\\nJenasen 76 MW\\n\\nKuuronkallio 60 MW\\nHedet 81 MW\\n\\n160 MW\\nWindpark Krammer 26 MW\\n\\nBeaufort 76 MW\\nEolus 62 MW\\n\\nLakiakangas 50 MW\\n\\nBouwdokken 9 MW\\n\\nDelfzijl 63 MW\\n\\nSunport 31 MW\\n\\nYum Yum 147 MW\\n\\nBellefonte 150 MW\\nRed Dirt\\n\\nGreat Western Minco ll 139 MW Georgia Power C&I\\n\\n225 MW\\n\\n101 MW\\n\\n79 MW\\n\\nWind\\n\\nSolar\\n\\nTaiyen 10 MW\\n\\nEl Romero 80 MW\\n\\nFrom 2010 to 2018, Google signed 34 agreements to purchase more than 3.75 GW of renewable energy that is new to the grid.\\n\\nFigure 5\\nRENEWABLE ENERGY FOR GOOGLE\\'S OPERATIONS\\n\\nReaching 100% renewable energy\\nWe achieved our 100% renewable energy target much faster and at much greater scale than we thought possible when we set this goal seven years ago. We met it primarily by buying renewable electricity directly from new wind and solar farms via long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) on the grids where we have operations, as well as by buying renewable power through utilities via renewable energy purchasing models that we helped create. In addition, a portion of our utility energy purchases include renewable sources as part of the utility\\'s grid mix.29 With our PPAs, we\\'re purchasing physical renewable energy, which includes the electrons bundled with renewable energy certificates (RECs).\\nBy pioneering new energy purchasing models that others can follow, we\\'ve helped drive wide-scale adoption of clean energy. For example, we joined forces with Walmart, Target, and Johnson & Johnson in Georgia to help build a state-approved program that allows companies to buy renewable energy directly through the state\\'s largest utility. The program is the first of its kind in Georgia and has paved the way for construction of two solar energy projects with a total capacity of 177 megawatts (MW).\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\\n\\n26\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nAlso in the Southeast region of the United States, we worked with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to sign a utility-based agreement where Google will purchase the output of several new solar farms, totaling 413 MW of power from 1.6 million solar panels-- equivalent to the combined size of 65,000 home rooftop solar systems. Thanks to the abundant solar power generated by these new farms, electricity consumed by our new data centers under construction in Tennessee and Alabama will be matched with 100% renewable energy from day one.\\nOur efforts to expand carbon-free energy in 2018 also took us to Europe, where we announced agreements in Finland to purchase additional renewable electricity from three new wind farms totaling 190 MW--our first such deals in the country.\\nOur renewable energy initiatives earned Google two 2018 Green Power Leadership Awards: one in International Market Development from the Center for Resource Solutions and one in Excellence in Green Power Use from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\\nDeepMind and Google recently started using machine learning (ML) to make wind power more predictable and valuable. We used ML to optimize 700 MW of wind power capacity in the Central United States that is part of our global fleet of renewable energy projects. By predicting wind power output 36 hours ahead of actual generation, our model recommends how\\nFigure 6\\nRENEWABLE ENERGY PURCHASING COMPARED WITH TOTAL ELECTRICITY USE\\nTotal electricity consumption (TWh) Renewable energy %\\n-- 10 100%\\n-- 8 100%\\n-- 6\\n\\nELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION (TWh)\\n\\n-- 4\\n\\n61%\\n\\n48%\\n\\n-- 2\\n\\n37% 34% 35%\\n0 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\\n\\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\\n\\n27\\nMinco II wind farm in Oklahoma (101 MW for Google)\\n\\nto make optimal hourly delivery commitments to the power grid a full day in advance. This is important because energy sources that can be scheduled (i.e., can deliver a set amount of electricity at a set time) are often more valuable to the grid. To date, ML has boosted the value of our wind energy by roughly 20%, compared to the baseline scenario of no time-based commitments to the grid.\\nWe\\'re also helping to green the power grid through our advocacy of clean energy policies and our support for renewable energy procurement programs. For example, we worked with business and government stakeholders in Taiwan to share our experience with the benefits of corporate renewable energy purchasing and to support the creation of new purchasing channels for companies. We were pleased to see that Taiwan passed a law in January 2017 to allow end-users to directly purchase renewable energy for their operations. In 2018, we signed our inaugural renewable energy deal in Asia, the first such corporate power purchase agreement in Taiwan. We will purchase the output of a 10 MW solar array (which is part of a larger solar farm) in Tainan City, Taiwan. It will deploy 40,000 solar panels across commercial fishing ponds, maximizing land-use efficiency and benefiting local aquaculture workers. This will boost the carbon-free profile of our local data center.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\\n\\n28\\nTo date, Google\\'s renewable energy purchasing contracts have led to nearly\\n$5 billion\\nin new capital investment in renewable energy projects around the world.\\n\\nAlong with being the world\\'s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy, Google is also one of the world\\'s largest corporate investors in renewable energy. Since 2010, we\\'ve committed to invest nearly $2.5 billion in large-scale renewable energy projects and residential solar rooftop funds with a total combined capacity of 3.7 GW.30 These targeted investments go beyond our own operational footprint, enabling renewable energy deployment at a larger scale while generating attractive risk-adjusted returns.\\nThe cost of renewable power has dropped precipitously, while its scale has grown dramatically. Since 2009, levelized costs for utility-scale wind and solar energy have decreased by 69% and 88%, respectively.31 In 2015, wind and solar energy became the world\\'s largest source of newly installed power capacity,32 and in 2018, 65% of net new power capacity globally came from renewable energy.33 Renewables have become a mainstream source of affordable electricity for millions of people.\\nIncreasing the share of renewables on the grid will produce many positive impacts. For example, doubling renewables by 2030 is expected to increase global GDP by as much as 1.1%, improve global welfare by 3.7%, and employ more than 24 million people in the renewable energy sector.34 To date, Google\\'s renewable energy purchasing contracts have led to nearly $5 billion in new capital investment in renewable energy projects around the world.35 At Google, we\\'ll continue doing our best to help accelerate the transition to clean energy and a more prosperous future.\\nLEARN MORE 2016 white paper: Achieving Our 100% Renewable Energy Purchasing Goal and Going Beyond 2016 spotlight: Greening the Grid: How Google Buys Renewable Energy 2018 blog post: Meeting Our Match: Buying 100 Percent Renewable Energy 2018 spotlight: Unlocking Access to Corporate Renewable Energy Purchasing in Taiwan 2018 blog post: A new partnership to drive renewable energy growth in the U.S. 2018 blog post: New wind in Finland: Scaling renewable energy as we grow 2018 blog post: The Internet is 24x7.

Every year since 2009, we\\'ve publicly reported the results to CDP, a global organization that asks companies to disclose information on their GHG emissions performance and management. Our report received an A score from CDP for the past five years, and for the past four years, we earned a spot on CDP\\'s Climate A List, which recognizes top reporting companies.\\nIn 2018, our gross Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions were 4.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), but because of our renewable energy purchases, our net GHG emissions were reduced by 3.7 million tons to 750 thousand tCO2e (see Figures 7 and 8). Due to growth in our business, our operational emissions increased 30% over the past year.36 After accounting for our carbon offset purchases, our net operational carbon emissions were zero.\\nSince 2011, our renewable energy purchasing has resulted in emissions savings of nearly 11 million tCO2e--a cumulative 52% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions over this period (see Figure 9). This is equivalent to taking nearly 2.3 million cars off the road for a year, or the carbon sequestered by more than 12.5 million acres of U.S. forests in a year.37 In 2018, our operational GHG emissions were 83% lower due to our renewable energy procurement (see Figure 9).\\n\\nFigure 7\\n\\nFigure 8\\n\\nGHG EMISSIONS WITHOUT RENEWABLE\\n\\nGHG EMISSIONS WITH RENEWABLE\\n\\nENERGY PURCHASES\\n\\nENERGY PURCHASES\\n\\n-- 6\\n\\n4.9\\n-- 4\\n\\nMILLION tCO2e\\n\\n-- 2\\n1.2\\n\\n0\\n\\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\\n\\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\\n\\nScope 1 Scope 2 (location) Scope 2 (market) Scope 3 (business travel and commuting)38 Total location-based GHG emissions Total market-based GHG emissions\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\\n\\n30\\nMILLION tCO2e\\n\\nFigure 9\\nIMPACT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY PURCHASES ON GHG EMISSIONS\\nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (without renewable energy) Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (with renewable energy)\\n\\n5 -- 4 -- 3 --\\n2 -- 1 -- 0\\n2011\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n4.4\\n0.75\\n2018\\n\\nFigure 10\\nCARBON INTENSITY PER UNIT OF REVENUE\\nCarbon intensity Total revenues\\n\\n40 -- 35 -- 30 -- 25 -- 20 -- 15 -- 10 -- 0\\n2011\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2016\\n\\n136.8 -- 150\\n\\n-- 120\\n\\n-- 90\\n\\n-- 60\\n\\n5.5\\n\\n2017\\n\\n30 2018\\n\\nBILLION US$\\n\\ntCO2e /BILLION US$\\n\\nFigure 11\\nCARBON INTENSITY PER FTE EMPLOYEE\\n\\nCarbon intensity Average number of FTE employees 60 --\\n\\n50 --\\n\\n40 -- 30 --\\n\\n20 -- 10 --\\n\\n0 2011\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2015\\n\\ntCO2e /FTE\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n-- 100\\n89.5\\n-- 80\\n-- 60\\n-- 40\\n8.4\\n20 2018\\n31\\n\\nTHOUSAND FTEs\\nDelfzijl wind farm in the Netherlands (63 MW for Google)\\n\\nTo align with industry best practices for Scope 3 reporting, in 2018, we extended our boundaries to include manufacturing emissions beyond Tier 1 suppliers (full upstream to the point of extraction), use of sold products, end-of-life treatment of sold products, and emissions associated with food from our corporate offices. We continue to improve the level of certainty we have in calculating our Scope 3 emissions and to work to reduce them. For example, our vision is for all our suppliers\\' sites to source 100% renewable energy in every region where our products are made.\\nBecause of our emissions-reduction efforts, our carbon intensity has steadily decreased even as our company has grown and our energy use has correspondingly increased. Since 2011, our carbon intensity per unit of revenue decreased by 86% (see Figure 10), our carbon intensity39 per FTE employee decreased by 84% (see Figure 11), and our carbon intensity for electricity used at our data centers dropped by 91%. This means we\\'re delivering our products and services with reduced carbon impacts, even before using carbon offsets to reach neutrality.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\\n\\n32\\nWells capture methane gas at Oneida-Herkimer Regional Landfill in New York.\\nTwelve years of carbon neutrality\\nIn 2007, Google committed to being carbon neutral, and we\\'ve met this goal every year since then. We reach carbon neutrality via three steps. First, we work to reduce our total energy consumption by pursuing aggressive energyefficiency initiatives. Second, we match 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations with purchases of renewable energy. Third, we buy carbon offsets for any remaining emissions we haven\\'t yet eliminated.40\\nWhen we committed to carbon neutrality, we saw carbon offsets as an interim solution. As we work to reduce our emissions, our need for carbon offsets will continue to decrease. We reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by improving energy efficiency and procuring renewable energy. We reduce our operational Scope 3 emissions by minimizing the need for business travel through encouraging use of video conferencing tools like Google Hangouts for meetings, and facilitating employees to use sustainable commuting options for employees, such as public transit, shuttles, carpooling, or electric vehicles.\\nWhen we do purchase carbon offsets, we follow stringent principles. We invest in high-quality, third-party-verified offsets, including landfill gas projects and animal waste management systems. All our offsets are additional, meaning that the projects reduce GHG emissions that wouldn\\'t\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\\n\\n33\\nWe will continue\\nto work toward\\nnet zero\\ncarbon in the decade\\nto come and to increase\\nthe net positive impact\\nof our products.\\n\\nbe reduced through other incentives. We also ensure that the projects we invest in are permanent sources of carbon reduction or sequestration, rather than temporary solutions. Finally, whenever possible, we invest for the long term, which offers owners and developers the financial stability they need to continue operating.\\nGoogle has been carbon neutral for twelve years, and in that time, we\\'ve partnered with more than 40 carbon offset projects to offset more than 19 million tCO2e.41 One of Google\\'s long-standing project partners is OneidaHerkimer Solid Waste Management Authority, a landfill gas project in upstate New York, United States. By enabling us to reduce our carbon footprint while reducing local air pollution, improving waste management, and increasing local revenue streams, each of these collaborations is a win for both Google and our communities.\\nOur commitment to reduce GHG emissions goes beyond our operational boundaries; some of our products enable users to reduce their own GHG emissions. For example, Google Maps and Waze Carpool help commuters reduce emissions by making transit and carpooling information more accessible. Nest thermostats help people reduce home energy consumption by controlling heating and cooling. And Project Sunroof helps users estimate potential solar energy production if they were to install rooftop solar. We will continue to work toward net zero carbon in the decade to come and to increase the net positive impact of our products.\\nLEARN MORE 2011 white paper: Google\\'s Carbon Offsets: Collaboration and Due Diligence 2017 white paper: 10 Years of Carbon Neutrality 2017 spotlight: Capturing Value from Waste in Upstate New York Website: Responsible Supply Chain\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\\n\\n34\\nSpotlight\\nThe Internet is 24x7--carbonfree energy should be too\\nElectricity is the fuel that allows our data centers to deliver billions of Google searches, YouTube views, and much more--every single day, around the clock. For the past two years, we matched 100% of our electricity consumption with purchases of renewable energy.\\nAs exciting as this milestone was, it was only the first step toward a much more ambitious, long-term challenge: to source carbon-free energy to match our electricity consumption in all places, at all times. This means realizing a future where each Google facility is always matched--around the clock-- with local carbon-free power.\\nIn October 2018, we published an inside look at the sources of Google\\'s electricity around the globe, to gauge how we\\'re tracking toward our longterm aspiration of sourcing 24x7 carbon-free energy. We shared locationspecific \"Carbon Heat Maps\" to visualize how well a data center is matched with carbon-free energy on an hour-by-hour basis.\\nSome of our data centers--like the one in Hamina, Finland--are already performing remarkably well: 97% of the facility\\'s electricity use last year was matched with carbon-free sources. Others still have room to improve.\\nCreating a carbon-free future will not be easy. It will require innovations across policy, technology, and business models. But the urgency of climate change demands bold solutions. \"We\\'re keeping our eyes on the prize,\" says Michael Terrell, director of operations at Google. \"And that\\'s making carbon-free power the status quo.\" Read how we\\'re taking steps toward a 24x7 carbon-free future\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nMinco II wind farm in Oklahoma (101 MW for Google)\\n\\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\\n\\n35\\nCreating sustainable workplaces\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\n36\\nSUSTAINABLE WORKPLACES: BY THE NUMBERS\\n13 million\\nsquare feet LEED-certified\\nBy the end of 2018, over 1.2 million square meters (13 million square feet) of Google office facilities had achieved LEED certification.\\n76%\\nlandfill diversion\\nIn 2018, we reached a 76% landfill diversion rate for our offices globally.\\n6.6 million\\npounds of food waste prevented\\nSince 2014, Google has prevented over 3 million kilograms (6.6 million pounds) of pre-consumer food waste in our cafs globally.\\n40,000\\ntCO2e savings\\nBy using Google shuttles in the Bay Area in 2018, we saved 40,000 tCO2e emissions-- equivalent to taking 8,760 cars off the road every work day.\\n\\nOverview\\nAmericans spend roughly 90% of their time indoors, and much of that time is spent at work.42 At Google, just as we focus on people when it comes to designing our products, we also focus on people when creating healthy and sustainable workplaces--from our Bay Area headquarters to our offices in more than 150 cities spanning over 50 countries around the world. To do so, we look for innovative ideas that deliver measurable results and can be implemented at scale.\\nWe start by applying industry-leading green building standards wherever possible. Our ongoing goal is to pursue third-party green or healthy-building certifications for our office projects, such as LEED, WELL Building Standard, and Living Building Challenge. By the end of 2018, over 1.2 million square meters (13 million square feet) of Google office facilities had achieved LEED certification, with 28% of our LEED-certified square footage achieving a Platinum rating and 57% a Gold rating (see Figure 12).\\nAs part of our carbon neutral strategy, we continually pursue energy efficiency initiatives to reduce our energy consumption. In 2011, our Google office in New York City committed to the NYC Carbon Challenge--a voluntary, public-private partnership with the mayor\\'s office in which organizations strive for a 30% reduction in GHG emissions per FTE by 2030. After meeting the 30% reduction goal early, we committed to a 50% reduction goal by 2025.43 By the end of 2018, we had already met our target seven years ahead of schedule--reducing GHG emissions by 54% per FTE at our New York City office--primarily due to various energy efficiency and emissions reductions projects.\\nWe also have a strong focus on the impacts associated with material selection, production, transportation, use, serviceability, and recycling of the products used for our spaces. We work to ensure that these products are safe for humans and the environment throughout their life cycles. We believe an industry-wide transition to safe chemistry and healthy materials is on the horizon. But making safe chemistry and healthy materials the new norm will require collective action across sectors, increased access to high-quality data that assesses chemical hazards, demand signals (from buyers like Google) to material and product manufacturers, and advancements in recycling technology and infrastructure.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nCreating sustainable workplaces\\n\\n37\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nFigure 12\\nCUMULATIVE LEED-CERTIFIED OFFICE SPACE\\nl Certified & Silver l Gold l Platinum\\n\\n-- 1.2M\\n\\n-- 0.9M\\n\\nSQUARE METERS\\n\\n-- 0.6M\\n\\n-- 0.3M\\n\\n0 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\\nConsidering local environments\\nWe take a science- and community-driven approach to managing our campuses, with the aim of having a positive impact in the places where we operate and of designing and building our offices with local environments, ecology, and animal habitats in mind. One example is the thriving egret rookery in the middle of our Mountain View, California, campus. Since 2013, the Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society (SCVAS) and Google have worked together to provide conservation guidance and educational programming for the nesting area. Conservation efforts include limiting vehicular traffic during the breeding season, establishing a protocol for collecting and caring for injured and orphaned egrets, and installing signage. Additionally, the SCVAS organizes \"Egret Office Hours,\" attracting hundreds of Googlers, community members, North Bayshore company employees, nature enthusiasts, school groups, and others to learn about the rookery.\\nAnother example is our science-based Design Guidelines for Bay Area landscaping projects. By the end of 2018, we had implemented our Habitat Design Guidelines on over 100 acres across our Bay Area headquarters. Areas once defined by lawn and hedges now host vibrant colonies of California wildflowers teeming with native bees and butterflies. These areas are studied and monitored to help inform future design decisions.\\n\\nCreating sustainable workplaces\\n\\n38\\nGoogle\\'s offices are designed with people and the planet in mind.\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nSustainability in our offices\\nWe reduce our water footprint by installing water-saving technologies and using reclaimed water wherever possible. In 2018, we set a target to reduce potable water intensity at our Bay Area headquarters by 5% by 2019. We\\'re on track to meet this target: By the end of 2018, we achieved a 3% reduction in potable water intensity--equivalent to avoiding the use of over 42 million liters (11 million gallons) of potable water. Our current approach to global goal setting focuses on the highest-impact opportunities. We\\'re now targeting our work at Google offices in highly water-stressed locations and in offices that are supported by recycling and composting infrastructure.\\nWe implement strategies to minimize contamination in our office waste streams and identify diversion pathways that keep the waste we do generate out of landfills. In 2018, we reached 76% landfill diversion for our offices globally, and we surpassed our target to reduce landfill waste per Googler by 10% at our Bay Area headquarters--achieving a 15% reduction in landfill waste per Googler by the end of 2018. We also tracked waste generation for global offices that represent 53% of Google\\'s total headcount.\\nOur cafs and Food Spots offer nutritious, responsibly sourced meals, snacks, and beverages.44 We make thoughtful choices in the products we buy and the suppliers we buy them from. Our sustainability priorities include food waste prevention, sustainable hydration initiatives that encourage the use of reusable vessels for drinking water, and the promotion of balanced,\\n\\nCreating sustainable workplaces\\n\\n39\\nplant-forward offerings--all of which help reduce our environmental impact and support human health and well-being. We constantly come up with inventive solutions to repurpose food and look to compost and donate leftovers wherever we\\'re legally able to do so, but we\\'ve learned that the best way to reduce food waste is to prevent it in the first place by tracking data and making adjustments. In 2018, this sort of data-driven optimization helped Google prevent more than 1 million kilograms (2.25 million pounds) of pre-consumer food waste in our cafs around the world, totaling over 3 million kilograms (6.6 million pounds) of food waste prevented since 2014. Also, by the end of 2018, 12 of our top 25 office sites were on track to reduce single-use beverages per seated headcount by 20% relative to a 2017 baseline.\\nOur Transportation team plans, implements, and operates mobility solutions to support Google\\'s global growth. We set ambitious goals for helping Googlers transition to shuttles, carpooling, public transit, biking, and walking. There are also a growing number of electric vehicles in our Google-owned and -operated commuter program fleet, with the majority of the nonelectric vehicles using renewable diesel. In 2018, our Bay Area headquarters remained on track to meet our long-term goal of reducing single-occupancy vehicle commuting to 45%. We also have a target to provide electric vehicle charging stations for 10% of total parking spaces at our Bay Area headquarters. To date, we\\'re on track to incorporate this design standard for new construction and tenant improvement projects and we\\'ve installed more than 2,700 electric vehicle charging ports at our offices in the United States.

Our Bay Area headquarters and many of our global offices host annual events to celebrate Earth Day and World Environment Day, where we share how Googlers can be sustainable on campus, at home, and in their communities. We also host an annual employee recognition program to recognize Googlers around the world who are driving sustainability across the company. The award winners are selected by members of our executive leadership team and are invited to attend an internal awards ceremony. Throughout the year we also invite thought leaders and experts to speak on the latest trends, achievements, and challenges related to sustainability, some of which are posted on the Talks at Google YouTube channel.\\nOur employees constantly reinvigorate our determination to build a better future. As we continue to explore sustainability strategies, we\\'re committed to sharing what we learn with other companies to help foster the growth of more productive, environmentally friendly businesses.\\nLEARN MORE 2018 case study: The Role of Safe Chemistry and Healthy Materials in Unlocking the Circular Economy 2018 case study: Seeding Resilience with Ecology 2018 spotlight: Ecologically focused landscapes are coming to life on Google campuses 2018 blog post: Every summer, Google\\'s campus is for the birds YouTube channel: Talks at Google\\n\\nGooglers explore different booths at Google Environment Day.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nCreating sustainable workplaces\\n\\n41\\nSpotlight\\nThe journey toward healthier materials\\nIf you want to construct a building that\\'s healthier for people and the planet, the solution seems simple: Choose healthy materials made from safe chemistry.

And, now that our business includes building consumer hardware, our commitment remains the same. Our ambition is that every product we build will leave people, the planet, and our communities better than we found them. We\\'re at the start of a journey of reimagining how even better devices and consumer hardware experiences are created.\\nAlthough we\\'ve been making some consumer devices for a while, Google\\'s consumer hardware product area was formed just over three years ago. We\\'re working to integrate sustainability into our products, operations, and communities--making it not just an aspect of how we do business but the centerpiece of it. This is an ongoing endeavor that involves designing in sustainability from the start and embedding it into the entire product development process and across our operations, all while creating the products our customers want.\\nTo help us get a step closer to reaching our goals, in 2019 we shared a set of sustainability commitments for hardware devices and services. By 2020, 100% of all shipments going to or from customers will be carbon neutral. By 2022, 100% of Made by Google products will include recycled materials, with a drive to maximize recycled content whenever possible. And we\\'re committed to making technology that puts people first and expands access to the benefits of technology.\\nLooking ahead, we know there\\'s more work to be done. We\\'ll continue working to design energy-efficient products. We\\'ll continue working to extend the useful life of our products by making them more serviceable. And we\\'ll continue ensuring that our products are accessible for as many people as possible. We\\'re excited about the direction we\\'re headed.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nBuilding better devices and services\\n\\n44\\nSome of Google\\'s consumer hardware products: Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3, Google Home Mini, Google Nest Hub, and Google Home\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nConsumer devices\\nOver the past few years, we\\'ve been steadily growing our family of great consumer hardware products. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful, make your life easier, and get better over time by combining the best of Google\\'s AI, software, and hardware. This is reflected in our latest generation of hardware products like Pixel 3 phones and the Google Nest Hub smart display. Creating beautiful products that people rely on every day is a journey that we\\'re investing in for the long run, and one we want to do in a sustainable way.\\nIn 2018, we launched a suite of new products, including the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL phones, Google Pixel Slate, Google Nest Hub, Google Clips, Google Nest Hello Doorbell, Google Nest Temperature Sensor, Nest x Yale Lock, Titan Security Key, and Chromecast. Other products we offer include Google Home, Google Home Max, Google Home Mini, and Google Pixelbook. We hold ourselves to the highest environmental standards and strive to ensure that Google products are designed, manufactured, and disposed of in a sustainable way. This applies to how we think about materials, manufacturing processes, energy efficiency, and packaging.\\nWe\\'re laying the foundation for what we believe will be a way of doing business that commits to building better products and services. Google has a company-level goal to increase the sustainability and circularity of our consumer electronic products, operations, and communities. We\\'ve made good progress so far, and we have great momentum.\\n\\nBuilding better devices and services\\n\\n45\\nIn 2018 alone, Nest thermostats helped customers save nearly\\n12 billion\\nkWh of energy--more energy than Google used this year.\\n\\nFor most devices, in 2018 we began publishing product environmental reports, which help people understand the sustainability attributes of our products. Each product environmental report provides an overview of that device\\'s environmental impact in areas such as material composition, life cycle GHG emissions, and energy efficiency. Starting in 2020, we\\'ll publish product environmental reports for all of the flagship products we launch.\\nWe consider sustainability throughout the entire life cycle of a device, including its production, transportation, use, and end of life. Our product life cycle assessments give us insight into our largest opportunities for reducing the environmental impact of a given product. For example, GHG emissions from shipping are an important contributor to the environmental impact of our products. From 2017 to 2018, we reduced carbon emissions for product shipments by 40% per unit, on average, by shifting many devices from air to ocean shipping.\\nWe want to ensure that the materials and substances used for our products are safe for people and the environment, can be reused to create future products, and retain economic value. One of the keys to unlocking the circular economy is safer chemistry from the start, so in 2017, we published our Restricted Substances Specification to ensure the use of safer materials across our products.\\nWe support greener electronics standards and certifications, including UL 110, IEEE 1680.1, and the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT).45 We strive for the highest rating available for applicable products within available product categories. We\\'ve achieved EPEAT Gold registration for all current models of the Pixel 3 phone.46\\nWe also strive to make our products as energy-efficient as possible. For example, the 2018 Google Pixelbook incorporates power-management software to reduce energy consumption during use. This allowed it to attain ENERGY STAR certification, which means it has energy performance among the top 25% of similar products of its type. And in 2018 alone, Nest thermostats helped customers save nearly 12 billion kWh of energy--more energy than Google used in 2018.\\nTo accelerate the transition to a circular economy, it\\'s critical to create demand for recycled materials. To date, we\\'ve shipped millions of devices made with post-consumer recycled plastic. Products like the Nest Thermostat E, Google Home, and Chromecast all contain parts with 20% 75% post-consumer recycled plastic content.\\nCaption\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nBuilding better devices and services\\n\\n46\\nNew plastic made from fossil fuels is the industry standard for consumer electronics, and incorporating recycled plastic involves surmounting a number of challenges. It requires building new processes and approaches while ensuring that materials meet our rigorous quality and technical specifications, costs are viable, and products are delivered on time. To meet these requirements, we spent years building partnerships with top-tier raw materials suppliers willing to invest in producing high-quality materials and innovation. Going forward, we\\'re committed to expanding the use of sustainable materials across our portfolio of products.\\nWe\\'re also making it easier for people to give their old devices a second life. Customers can responsibly recycle devices for free--whether made by Google or not--via our take-back program for all products, available in 16 countries, and via our U.S. Pixel trade-in program, through which customers can earn credit toward a new Pixel purchase.\\nOur commitments go beyond the consumer electronic products we make. We\\'re committed to minimizing our environmental impact as well as improving the lives of people who make our products. We require the highest ethical standards throughout our supply chain and are working to drive positive impacts in the communities in which we operate. Our Supplier Code of Conduct articulates our expectations for suppliers and is based on the Google Code of Conduct and on international human rights, safety, and environmental standards.\\nBuilding on the progress we\\'ve already made, in 2019, we shared our inaugural public commitments for consumer hardware. First, we aim to design products and services for circularity and to reuse materials at their highest\\n\\nThe Nest Learning Thermostat in a home\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nBuilding better devices and services\\n\\n47\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nA family using the Google Pixel Slate\\nenvironmental and social value. Many of our Nest products already include significant levels of post-consumer recycled plastic. Starting in 2022, 100% of Made by Google products will include recycled materials, and we\\'ll strive to maximize recycled content wherever possible. By decreasing our use of new materials, we\\'ll reduce our waste per device while signaling our demand for a more circular economy.\\nSecond, we aim to be the neighbor everyone wants in the communities in which we operate. By 2020, 100% of all shipping of device orders going to or from customers will be carbon neutral. To achieve carbon neutrality for shipping, we have a two-step approach: The first step is carbon reduction. Our goal is to work with shipping partners to reduce shipping emissions; we\\'ve already successfully driven a shift from air to ocean in many cases, and we\\'ll continue to look for solutions like this. For the emissions that remain, our second step will be to purchase high-quality carbon offsets. Shipping devices to consumers falls outside the scope of Google\\'s operations, and thus goes above and beyond our long-standing commitment to carbon neutrality.\\nFinally, we\\'re committed to make technology that puts people first and to expand access to the benefits of technology. One way we do this is through energy partnerships.\\n\\nBuilding better devices and services\\n\\n48\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nEnergy partnerships\\nOur products enable customers to be more thoughtful about their individual environmental impact. Connected homes can help streamline consumers\\' daily decisions about resource consumption, making sustainable choices easier for busy households. For example, smart thermostats can play a critical role in addressing climate change by automatically saving energy and helping consumers be more aware of their energy usage. These savings benefit customers, as well as the utilities generating and delivering the energy, while reducing energy use and GHG emissions.\\nThe Nest thermostat controls residential heating and cooling systems-- which make up around half of a home\\'s energy consumption--and uses AI and ML to reduce energy consumption and achieve collective savings as it learns how and when to keep users comfortable while at the same time optimizing for energy efficiency. On average, Nest thermostats have proven energy savings of 10%12% for heating and 15% for cooling,47 which means they pay for themselves in under two years as a result of those savings.48 In February 2017, the Nest Learning Thermostat became the first thermostat to achieve ENERGY STAR certification by the EPA.49 And by the end of 2018, Nest thermostats had helped customers cumulatively save more than 29 billion kWh of energy (see Figure 13), based on average savings studies-- enough energy to power all of San Francisco\\'s electricity consumption for five years and nearly three times as much energy as Google used in 2018. That\\'s\\n\\nFigure 13\\nCUMULATIVE HOUSEHOLD ENERGY SAVED BY NEST THERMOSTAT USERS\\nn Savings per year\\n\\n29.1 -- 30\\n\\n-- 25\\n\\n-- 20\\n\\n-- 15\\n\\n-- 10\\n\\n-- 5\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2018\\n\\nTHOUSAND GWh\\n\\nBuilding better devices and services\\n\\n49\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nequivalent to avoiding 9.6 million tCO2e emissions--or taking more than 2 million cars off the road for a year.50\\nWe help consumers save energy and money by forming partnerships with a variety of energy companies and service providers across North America. We\\'ve partnered with nearly 100 companies to offer Nest thermostat and demand response programs.\\nNest\\'s Rush Hour Rewards program works in partnership with utilities to reduce energy use during times of peak demand through harnessing the power of consumer engagement--acting as a leader in demand response programs for energy customers. For example, during the 2017 solar eclipse, Nest launched a special Rush Hour program with an opt-in feature that allowed Nest thermostats to automatically pre-cool customers\\' homes, reducing demand on the grid at a time when solar energy production dropped by thousands of megawatts. More than 750,000 Nest thermostats worked together across the United States to reduce demand by 700 MW.51 In 2018, Nest and partners also pioneered residential gas demand response programs. In a world of gas shortages and increasing weather variability, these programs are proving their capability to manage demand spikes and increase system flexibility.\\nWe also work with energy, government, nonprofit, and manufacturer partners to expand access to the benefits of technology through incomequalified programs. Today, nearly one in four U.S. families struggle with a high energy burden, with up to 20%50% of income going to energy bills.52 In 2018, we launched the Nest Power Project, which aims to install 1 million energy- and money-saving Nest thermostats in homes that need them most over the next five years. We\\'re proud to help our partners meet their efficiency and customer participation goals and are excited about our collective impact on consumers as well as the environment.\\nLEARN MORE 2015 white paper: Energy Savings from the Nest Learning Thermostat 2018 report: Circular Consumer Electronics: An Initial Exploration 2018 reports: Product Environmental reports 2018 report: Responsible Supply Chain Report Guidelines: Alphabet\\'s Conflict Minerals Policy and Report Guidelines: Google Supplier Code of Conduct Guidelines: Policy Against Modern Slavery and 2018 Modern Slavery Statement Guidelines: Restricted Substances Specification Website: Google Store Sustainability Website: Nest Power Project Website: Responsible Supply Chain\\n\\nBuilding better devices and services\\n\\n50\\nSpotlight\\nNest uses energy-saving technology to relieve the low-income energy burden\\nIn the United States, low-income households spend three times as much of their income on energy as higher-income households.53 What\\'s more, many of these families live in older homes with inefficient heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, often forcing families in some parts of the United States to devote up to 50% of their monthly income toward utilities.54\\nOn Earth Day 2018, Nest and Google began tackling this energy gap with the Nest Power Project, an initiative designed to bring energy-saving technologies and assistance to those who need them most. To date, the project has donated more than $800,000 to nonprofits, such as United Way and Habitat for Humanity, that are helping connect low-income families with energy-assistance programs.\\nThe Power Project has also teamed up with nonprofits, utility companies, and mortgage financiers to install the Nest Thermostat E--a smart thermostat with proven energy-saving features--in qualified low-income households. This includes every home built by Habitat for Humanity in the United States in 2018 and low- and moderate-income households served by organizations such as Southern California Gas and Fannie Mae. Together, we aim to install 1 million energy- and money-saving Nest thermostats in low-income U.S. homes in the next five years.\\nWhile Google and Nest ultimately envision a more energy-efficient future to help combat climate change, the Power Project is working to provide energy savings for families today. \"If our thermostats and technology can help even one family stay warm this winter, we\\'ll consider it a job well done,\" says Jeff Hamel, director of energy and enterprise partnerships at Google.

We want to leverage our scale, resources, and technological expertise to meet the vast challenge posed by climate change and work to empower everyone--businesses, governments, nonprofit organizations, communities, and individuals--to use Google technology to help create a more sustainable and resource-efficient world.\\nGoogle Earth is used globally by millions to explore and understand our ever-changing planet. While Google Earth is for exploration and raising awareness, Google Earth Engine is focused on planetary-scale geospatial analysis, giving researchers access to Google\\'s massive cloud and computational capabilities. It includes 20 petabytes of freely available geospatial data, which are used by tens of thousands of active users around the world to create new knowledge that\\'s fundamentally changing what we know about Earth\\'s natural resources and how to manage them.\\nGoogle Maps provides more than 1 billion kilometers\\' (621 million miles\\') worth of transit results per day, helping limit carbon emissions by giving people access to mass transit options, bike routes, and traffic information. In 2018, Google Maps added new features that enable users to search for information about electric vehicle charging stations around the world and to see nearby Lime scooters, pedal bikes, and e-bikes as alternative transportation options right from the app.\\nWaze Carpool is also tackling the issue of too many cars on the road by encouraging Waze users to commute together, saving time and money, while reducing the strain on transportation infrastructure and the environment. By the end of 2018, Waze Carpool was available nationally throughout Israel, Brazil, and the United States.\\nUsing technology for good\\nIn 2018, Google AI announced its AI for Social Good program, which applies core Google research and engineering efforts to projects that help address social, humanitarian, and environmental challenges. Additionally, the program provides tools and resources through initiatives like the Google AI Impact Challenge, which was an open call for nonprofits, academics, and social enterprises from around the world to submit proposals on how they could use AI to help address some of the world\\'s greatest problems.\\nIn 2018, as part of Google\\'s AI for Social Good program and Crisis Response efforts, Google announced a flood-forecasting initiative pilot in Patna, India. To help keep people safe during floods, Google is using AI to create better forecasting models that predict when and where floods will occur. The predictions are made using a combination of ML, satellite imagery, and\\n\\nEmpowering users with technology\\n\\n53\\nAttendees explore the interactive Your Plan, Your Planet tool at Google\\'s booth at the 2018 Greentech Festival in Berlin, Germany.\\nphysics-based simulations. The predictions are then shared with affected individuals via Google Search, Google Maps, and Google Public Alerts.\\nAI can also aid in wildlife conservation. In 2018, as part of Google\\'s AI for Social Good program, we announced the work of Google AI researchers who teamed up with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to identify if humpback whales are present in more than 170,000 hours\\' worth of underwater audio recordings. This is part of a larger effort to help scientists better understand and protect whales--and hopefully in the future, other animal species as well.\\nUsing TensorFlow, Google\\'s open source ML platform, we\\'re enabling thousands of companies, nonprofits, researchers, developers, and students to apply ML to better predict extreme weather events, help farmers glean insights into their herd\\'s health and efficiency improvements for their farms, and prevent illegal deforestation in the Amazon.\\nIn 2018, Google teamed up with the California Academy of Sciences to launch Your Plan, Your Planet, an interactive tool to help people understand their environmental impact as it relates to food, energy, and water, while demonstrating simple, science-based ways to improve it.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nEmpowering users with technology\\n\\n54\\nRooftop solar provides renewable energy to a community in Manchester, England.

Our Geo team works with numerous research and nonprofit organizations to map the world\\'s forests, fisheries, watersheds, and air quality--and even to create a global database of power plants. We then work on getting that information into the hands of decision-makers.\\nIn 2018, we launched the Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE), an online tool created in collaboration with the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy and in partnership with five pilot cities: Buenos Aires, Argentina; Melbourne, Australia; Victoria, Canada; Mountain View, California, USA; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. By analyzing Google\\'s comprehensive global mapping data together with standard GHG emission factors, EIE estimates city-scale building and transportation carbon emissions data, as well as renewable energy potential, leading to more globally consistent baselines from which cities can measure, plan, act upon, and track progress toward emissions reductions.\\nProject Sunroof is an online tool that helps users explore whether they should go solar by analyzing high-resolution aerial mapping and 3D modeling of residential roofs to sun positions, historical weather patterns, shadows cast by nearby objects, and typical electricity consumption. In 2018, Project Sunroof expanded coverage into new markets around the world, including Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, and\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nEmpowering users with technology\\n\\n55\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nthe United Kingdom. Collectively, Project Sunroof has mapped more than 107 million rooftops across 21,500 cities since 2015. Policymakers are also using Sunroof data to make bold renewable energy commitments. For example, the City of San Jos, California used the data for a city-wide solar assessment to set a 1 GW solar energy target as part of its Smart City Action Plan. In addition to city climate plans, Sunroof data is being used by some of the world\\'s largest utilities, such as Engie and E.ON, to provide customers with the option to power their homes with solar energy.\\nProject Air View measures air quality data using Google Street View cars equipped with air quality sensors. In 2018, Project Air View increased its air quality mapping efforts, expanding beyond the United States to map air quality in Copenhagen, Denmark, and London, United Kingdom. We announced plans to further expand coverage to more cities around the world by equipping 50 Street View vehicles with Aclima\\'s mobile air sensors. By the end of 2018, Project Air View had captured more than 475 million cumulative air quality measurements in 62 cities worldwide.\\nThrough Google Earth Timelapse, a global, zoomable video that lets us see how the world has changed over recent decades, we can watch as cities grow, forests disappear, glaciers recede, and lakes dry up. We can also help monitor and promote sustainable resource management with tools like Global Fishing Watch (GFW), which monitors the planet\\'s fisheries by tracking the locations and behaviors of commercial fishing fleets, powered by Google Cloud Platforms\\' machine learning algorithms. In 2018, GFW published 13 papers in top-tier journals and successfully drove new commitments and programs with governments from Canada, Indonesia, Japan, and Peru. Ultimately, our vision is to continue leveraging our mapping, cloud, and ML technologies to create a living, breathing dashboard of our planet that can help inform everyday decisions for individuals, organizations, and nations.\\nLEARN MORE 2017 report: Cities in the Circular Economy: The Role of Digital Technology 2018 spotlight: Transparency unleashed: How Global Fishing Watch is transforming fishery management 2018 blog: A tale of a whale song 2018 blog: AI for Social Good 2018 blog: Get charged up with Google Maps 2018 blog: How we explored the whole wide world with Google Earth in the past year 2018 blog: Fighting fire with machine learning: two students use TensorFlow to predict wildfires 2018 blog: The fight against illegal deforestation with TensorFlow 2018 blog: Air View is ready to expand to more places around the globe 2018 blog: Your Plan, Your Planet: How to reduce your environmental footprint\\n\\nEmpowering users with technology\\n\\n56\\nSpotlight\\nThe more you know: Turning environmental insights into action\\nTo date, more than 10,000 cities worldwide have committed to reducing their carbon footprints by 80% within the next 30 years. But, unlike large cities like New York and Berlin, which have access to huge carbon data sets, many small and midsize cities lack the resources to gather comprehensive data on building and transportation emissions. This makes it hard to set firm carbon commitments of their own.\\nThe Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE), an online tool created by Google in collaboration with the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy, is designed to provide carbon emissions insights to cities of all sizes-- and ultimately accelerate the transition to a low-carbon future.\\nDeveloped by the Google Earth Outreach team, EIE analyzes data from Google Maps and Google\\'s other climate-related projects, like Project Sunroof, to surface insights across four categories: building emissions, transportation emissions, solar energy potential, and climate projections. EIE pairs this information with third-party data and standard GHG emissions factors, deriving carbon estimates and reduction potential for cities around the world.\\nAlthough EIE is starting with a handful of cities initially, Google eventually plans to make these insights available to thousands of towns, cities, and regions across the globe. \"Imagine what we could accomplish if every city in the world were engaged in the fight against climate change,\" says Rebecca Moore, leader of the Earth Outreach team. \"What would the world look like?\" Read how Environmental Insights Explorer is bringing insights to cities\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nThe Environmental Insights Explorer tool provides city-level carbon emissions data.\\n\\nEmpowering users with technology\\n\\n57\\nAppendix\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\n58\\nEnvironmental data\\nThe following table provides an overview of our performance over time and includes environmental data for our global operations, including our data centers, offices, and other facilities.\\nData for GHG emissions and energy use covers Alphabet Inc. and all of its subsidiaries, including Google LLC.

At the end of 2018, we had 15 operational campuses across 19 data center locations. Some of our locations have more than one data center campus and others were not yet operational during 2018.\\n14. According to Google\\'s own analysis of our more efficient servers, power infrastructure, and cooling systems, compared with data center industry averages. 15. See note 14 above. 16. PUE is a standard industry ratio that compares the amount of noncomputing overhead energy (used for things like cooling and power distribution) to the amount of energy used to power\\nIT equipment. A PUE of 2.0 means that for every watt of IT power, an additional watt is consumed to cool and distribute power to the IT equipment. A PUE closer to 1.0 means nearly all the energy is used for computing. 17. According to the Uptime Institute\\'s 2019 Data Center Industry Survey, the global average PUE of respondents\\' largest data centers was around 1.67. 18. This slight decline from 2017 is partly due to new sites not yet included in our energy management system and partly due to a change in how we calculate this number. 19. At Google, Zero Waste to Landfill means that when waste leaves our operating data centers, none of it goes to a landfill--100% is diverted to more sustainable pathways, with no more than 10% going to a waste-to-energy facility, unless waste to energy can be proved more valuable than alternative diversion paths. Our approach is based on UL\\'s Environmental Claim Validation Procedure for Zero Waste to Landfill. Some waste cannot be diverted away from landfill for regulatory reasons. 20.

Carbon intensity figures are based on our combined Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions, with the exception of electricity consumption intensity, which is calculated using\\nonly market-based Scope 2 at the data centers. 40. A carbon offset is an investment in an activity that reduces carbon emissions. The reduction in carbon emissions is represented by a carbon credit. The credit, usually verified by a\\nthird party, signifies that GHG emissions are lower than they would have been had no one invested in the offset. One credit equals 1 metric ton (1,000 kilograms or 2,204 pounds) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) prevented from being released into the atmosphere. 41. CO2e is a quantity that describes, for a given mixture and amount of GHG, the amount of CO2 that would have the same global warming potential (GWP), i.e., the ability of a gas to trap heat in the atmosphere when measured over a specified timescale (generally, 100 years). Some GHGs are more potent than others, as measured by their GWP. Carbon dioxide is the baseline and thus has a GWP of 1.\\nCreating sustainable workplaces\\n42. Neil E.

Alphabet\\'s fiscal year runs from January 1 to December 31. Unless otherwise specified, reported data is global. 56. GHG emissions are calculated according to WRI\\'s Greenhouse Gas Protocol. For more information on our methodology, see Alphabet\\'s 2019 CDP Climate Change Report. 57. Since 2010, we\\'ve procured renewable energy for our operations, and in 2012, we began publishing how this reduces our overall carbon footprint. Up until 2015, there was no guidance\\nfrom WRI on how to account for these emissions reductions, so we developed our own methodology, whereby on an annual basis we assigned renewable electricity procured against electricity consumed (in MWh) in the closest data center to the renewable energy project. In 2015, WRI released new guidance for market-based Scope 2 accounting, which we adopted, starting with 2015 data. Our pre-2015 methodology differs from WRI\\'s in the use of residual mixes, which avoid double-counting of claimed renewable energy attributes. 58. In 2018, to align with industry best practices for Scope 3 reporting, we extended our reporting boundaries to include emissions associated with food from our corporate offices, hardware manufacturing emissions beyond Tier 1 suppliers (full upstream to the point of extraction), use of sold products, and end-of-life treatment of sold products. Google\\'s hardware includes data center servers, networking equipment and consumer hardware products. These extended categories will be reported annually going forward. 59. In 2016, we adopted the industry practice of including only operational emissions in our carbon neutrality commitment. Our 2016 operational emissions include Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting). For more information, see our 2017 white paper 10 Years of Carbon Neutrality. 60. See note 58 above. 61. See note 59 above. 62. See note 39 above. 63. Total energy consumption represents total Scope 2 electricity consumption plus total Scope 1 fuel use. 64. Power usage effectiveness (PUE) is an industry-recognized ratio to measure data center efficiency. For more information on our PUE and how we calculate it, see \"Efficiency: How We Do It\" on our website. 65. Percentage of renewable energy is calculated on a calendar-year basis, comparing the volume of renewable electricity (in MWh) purchased for our operations (i.e., renewable energy procured through our PPA contracts, on-site renewable energy generation, and residual renewable electricity delivered directly through the grid) with the total volume of electricity consumed by our operations.\\n\\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\n63\\n66. To align with the method outlined in note 65 above, starting in 2016, we adapted our methodology for calculating total electricity obtained from renewable sources. Prior to 2016, we were not accounting for the residual renewable electricity purchased through grid electricity.\\n67. Waste diverted to a more sustainable pathway than landfill or incineration without energy recovery. 68. Decommissioning activity decreased in 2017 and 2018 because most of the decommissioning returns in this period were from an older generation of technology, which did not qualify\\nfor redeployment. 69. Includes all water (both recycled and potable) consumed at offices and data centers. 70. Number of ports for ChargePoint stations in the United States only, which represent the majority of our electric vehicle charging ports in the United States. Emissions avoided are\\nestimated using data from these ports only. 71. In addition to our renewable energy contracts, Google also invests in renewable energy projects around the world that have an attractive risk-adjusted financial return. These projects\\nare not used to offset our carbon footprint. 72.

In such a world, the power of connectivity  keeping us in touch, informed and entertained  has never been more important.\\nAt AT&T, we\\'ve been connecting people, communities and businesses for more than 140 years, and we take that responsibility very seriously. Thanks to the resilience of our people and our networks, we\\'ve weathered many crises over the decades. And every time, we\\'ve emerged stronger than before.\\nWhether they\\'re in the field serving customers and maintaining our network, on the front lines putting their lives at risk to report breaking news, or at home remotely supporting key business operations, AT&T employees are always there for our communities and for one another  giving their all to continue providing essential services.\\nTo help ease the burden on the people who keep our company strong, we took a number of steps, including bonuses for front-line employees and managers, as well as temporary paid family leave to help all employees cover a broad range of COVIDrelated needs. And our Employee Relief Fund  a 501(c)(3) public charity supported by employee donations and matching grants from the AT&T Foundation  is helping\\n\\ncolleagues experiencing financial hardship due to circumstances beyond their control.\\nWe also launched a $10 million Distance Learning and Family Connections Fund to help give parents, students and teachers tools for at-home learning. We\\'ve temporarily extended service and waived late fees for customers who let us know they needed help as a result of coronavirus disruptions. And we offered additional news, educational and entertainment channels for free to our customers during this time.\\nThe work we do is critical to millions of people around the world, and we\\'re committed to being there when our colleagues and communities need us most.\\nThrough FirstNet, we\\'re providing advanced connectivity to the true heroes  first responders, healthcare providers, government agencies, military, police, fire and EMS. As a public safety partner, it\\'s an honor to serve and support them. We\\'ve also helped provide meals to those on the front lines and are using our texttodonate capabilities to encourage others to contribute.\\nThe events of 2020 have also highlighted the critical need for society to do better for our Black neighbors and colleagues. The deaths of George Floyd, Breonna\\n\\nTaylor, Ahmaud Arbery and far too many others expose deep-rooted injustices that continue to impact the Black community. We can and will help address systemic racism by supporting law enforcement reform and enhanced access to education, health care and economic opportunities for underserved communities.\\nAT&T has long been committed to advancing social and racial equality and inclusion, and we know there is much more work to do. We believe it\\'s a moral and business imperative for large companies to speak up when people are treated unfairly, to help influence needed policy change and to be an example for others by encouraging frank dialogue and learning among employees and community partners.\\nI\\'m proud of how our employees and our company have been there for our communities when they\\'ve needed us most. In addition to leadership on critical issues affecting society, we continue to encourage people not to text behind the wheel of a vehicle. We\\'re working to address climate change as one of the top U.S. purchasers of renewable energy, and we\\'re adopting science-based targets for our operations and supply chain. We remain committed to skills-building for our current and future employees. And we\\'re active in our communities, providing hands-on support through corporate giving, the AT&T Foundation and the generosity of our employee volunteers.\\n\\nAT&T\\'s historic commitment to doing business responsibly  and to our values of living true, being there, and making a difference  is foundational to who we are as a company and as individuals. Our strong governance structure will continue to guide and support these efforts, proving that great things can happen when we all come together to address important issues facing our communities and our world.\\n June 2020\\n2019/2020 AT&T CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUMMARY\\n\\nGLOBAL CHALLENGES\\n\\nPROGRESS\\n\\nINTRODUCTION & OPPORTUNITIES\\n\\nGOVERNANCE TOWARD GOALS\\n\\nKPIs\\n\\nRECOGNITION\\n\\n4\\n\\nWE ARE HERE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE\\nCHARLENE LAKE Senior Vice President, Corporate Social Responsibility and Chief Sustainability Officer\\n\\nD espite how unpredictable things may be today, AT&T\\'s desire to positively impact our world has helped sustain our company for generations.

We also help cultivate the future talent pipeline for AT&T  and industry at large  by supporting skills development and career readiness in our communities.\\nFor more than a decade, our AT&T Aspire initiative has been investing in projects and organizations that provide access to education and training for those who need it most. In these unprecedented times, we\\'ve reinforced our commitment and relationships to help provide parents, students and teachers the tools they need for home learning and resources to maintain meaningful connections when it\\'s not possible to be together in person.\\n\\nLong-term success requires us to be deliberate in our planning, but responsive to the needs of stakeholders and communities.\\nThe dramatic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of our legacy programs, and how quickly companies can be called to act in times of need.\\nBecause the core of our operations is considered essential by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security,1 we continue to ensure our workforce has the technical and leadership skills for the jobs of tomorrow. Each year we invest approximately\\n\\nToday\\'s societal issues also underscore the importance of localized, community support. That\\'s where the passion and service of AT&T employees really delivers. Our employees lead AT&T BelievesSM, our grassroots effort that blends corporate financial support with sweat equity, and leverages our expertise, time and company scale to maximize impact. COVID-19 has heavily impacted our communities, so we\\'ve dedicated $5.5 million to help provide needed meals for first responders, medical personnel and others serving around the clock.\\nAT&T Believes volunteers also are working to promote social justice. For example, Believe AtlantaSM and Believe IndySM volunteers\\n\\nare working to strengthen ties between law enforcement and the community. And Believe ChicagoSM and Believe Los AngelesSM are working to create opportunities for Black communities through hiring, education and skills development.\\nTo help amplify critical messages in support of racial equity, our WarnerMedia brands are donating advertising inventory and production assistance to civil rights organizations. In fact, we\\'re offering platforms to raise voices in many ways, such as our CNN town hall with characters from Sesame Street designed to help kids and families talk about race and inclusion.\\nWhile we\\'re focused on today\\'s critical issues, we\\'re maintaining our commitments to help tackle the ongoing climate emergency. AT&T has signed agreements surpassing 1.5 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity, making us one of the largest corporate purchasers in the U.S.\\nTo enhance the resiliency of our operations, our Climate Change Analysis Tool currently helps visualize climate-related risks to network infrastructure and operations in the southeastern U.S. up to 30 years into the future. And we\\'re making the data sets we use available to external organizations conducting their own research.\\nIn the pages of this report, you\\'ll see how AT&T is delivering solutions to leading global challenges and working to ensure our\\n\\nbusiness  and our society  is prepared for a more resilient tomorrow.\\nWe\\'re proud of our efforts and collective impact over the past year.

At AT&T, we believe it\\'s part of our civic duty to help keep our customers and communities connected.\\n\\nT he ability to communicate is essential for consumers and businesses. Our services help friends, families and colleagues maintain important connections even when society may be urged to stay apart.\\nFirst Responders and Our Communities For first responders, doctors, nurses and others delivering vital services during a public crisis, reliable connectivity can be a matter of life and death. This type of event is exactly why the FirstNet platform was created.\\nWhen the U.S. hospital ship Mercy docked in Los Angeles to provide temporary care, AT&T activated a 1 gigabit connection within 24 hours of the ship\\'s arrival and deployed a portable cell site nearby to increase capacity for the influx of first responders. In New York City, we helped equip hundreds of ambulances with FirstNet ReadyTM devices to enhance inter-agency communication. And because we understand that helping others around the clock can take a toll on those called to serve, AT&T supports FRONTLINEHELP.org, a free emotional wellness program for COVID-19 healthcare workers and first responders. We also committed $5.5 million to provide nourishing meals for front line workers and others in need impacted by COVID-19.\\n\\nAs the public seeks up-to-the-minute information on the pandemic and treatment efforts, millions look to AT&T for valuable news and updates. In March, CNN continued to be the #1 global news brand, reaching 362 million worldwide and 246 million in the U.S.  a record 75% of Americans, our biggest audience ever.2\\nOur Employees As the need for social distancing grew, AT&T implemented a sweeping work-fromhome policy. We authorized temporary compensation increases for employees on the front lines who can\\'t do their job from home, and implemented guidelines to help keep them safe. And we committed more than $100 million to help WarnerMedia cast and crew while on production hiatus.\\nCompany-wide, we temporarily increased available paid, excused time off to 160 total hours for quarantined employees testing positive or at higher risk for COVID-19, for parents or guardians of children whose school or daycare closed, and for primary caregivers of someone diagnosed with COVID-19 and unable to provide self-care.\\nRead more about our efforts at att.com/COVID.\\n\\nHOW WE\\'RE RESPONDING\\n\\nSMALL BUSINESS & INNOVATION As part of the Stand for Small coalition, AT&T is helping small businesses in the U.S. maintain their vital role in our communities and economy. The coalition provides valuable offers and tools as business owners work to reduce operating expenses, manage teams remotely and enhance their digital capabilities during the pandemic. We also joined the Open COVID Pledge initiative, offering free temporary licenses for AT&T patents that might aid in the fight against COVID-19.3\\n\\nCHILDREN & FAMILIES We\\'ve collaborated with Sesame Workshop to expand its Caring for Each Other initiative, to help kids and caregivers face challenges such as the do\\'s and don\\'ts for face coverings, illness of a family member and transitioning to a new normal. Cartoon Network also launched CNCheckIn, a platform where popular characters share tips like how to social distance with friends.\\n\\nDISTANCE LEARNING AT&T launched a $10 million Distance Learning and Family Connections Fund to support online learning and help family and friends stay connected.

We also regularly engage with the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Future of Privacy Forum, the Information Accountability Foundation, Access Now, Red en Defensa de los Derechos Digitales, ARTICLE 19 and RightsCon.\\nRead more in our Customer Privacy and Network & Data Security issue briefs at about.att.com/csr/reporting.\\n2019/2020 AT&T CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUMMARY\\nHUMAN RIGHTS\\n\\nGLOBAL CHALLENGES\\n\\nPROGRESS\\n\\nINTRODUCTION & OPPORTUNITIES\\n\\nGOVERNANCE TOWARD GOALS\\n\\nKPIs\\n\\nRECOGNITION\\n\\n17\\n\\nAT&T has a longstanding commitment to human rights that is embedded throughout our operations and managed by a committee of senior executives from across the business. We operate with transparency, engage with stakeholders and promote responsiveness and accountability around human rights issues.\\n\\nWe\\'re following guidance from the United Nations, including the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, as we plan future infrastructure investments. In 2020, we\\'re conducting similar internal assessments across Latin America and will use the results to optimize our business practices.\\n\\nI n 2019, we updated the AT&T Human Rights Policy by evaluating the work of our peers and identifying best practices across industries. Our approach is informed by international bodies and human rights frameworks such as the International Labour Organization, OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Last year, AT&T became the first U.S.-based telecommunications service provider to join the U.N. Global Compact to promote accountability and stakeholder dialogue in the areas of human rights, labor and the environment.\\nAT&T\\'s Human Rights policy reflects considerations for all our operating companies. For instance, WarnerMedia\\'s integration into our business reinforced our historical commitments to a free press, journalistic integrity, freedom of expression and broad accessibility of information.\\nThe AT&T Human Rights Policy also reflects our commitment to human rights due diligence. For example, a recent internal human rights assessment in Mexico informed us of sensitivities to placing cellular infrastructure on indigenous land.\\n\\n\"WarnerMedia\\'s integration into our business reinforced our historical commitments to a free press, journalistic integrity, freedom of expression and broad accessibility of information.\"\\n\\nThe size and scale of our operations allow us to be a leader in protecting human rights around the world through numerous industry collaborations. As a member of the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC), AT&T works alongside 17 global telecommunications companies to help ensure our suppliers are operating in accordance with our corporate social responsibility and human rights expectations.\\n\\nCONNECTING FAMILIES\\nWe recognize our services can play a role in promoting human rights around the world, and we developed a program in accordance with the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. The initiative supports unaccompanied migrant children fleeing violence in their home countries with free telephone calls to let family at home know they are safe.\\n\\nAT&T is also an active member of Tech Against Trafficking, a coalition of technology companies and global experts who seek to eradicate human trafficking through the use of technology. We formed an internal Online Safety Committee in 2019 to assess the risk of online child exploitation across our operating companies and to explore opportunities to include prevention efforts in our corporate responsibility initiatives. And in 2020, we are undertaking a comprehensive assessment of all business operations to ensure consistent, rigorous policies and practices are in place to protect children from exploitation.\\nRead more in our Human Rights issue brief at about.att.com/csr/reporting.\\n2019/2020 AT&T CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUMMARY\\n\\nGLOBAL CHALLENGES\\n\\nPROGRESS\\n\\nINTRODUCTION & OPPORTUNITIES\\n\\nGOVERNANCE TOWARD GOALS\\n\\nKPIs\\n\\nRECOGNITION\\n\\n18\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n19 CSR Governance & Leadership 20 CSR Governance Council & CSR Committees 21 Stakeholder Engagement 22 Corporate Responsibility Reporting\\n2019/2020 AT&T CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUMMARY\\n\\nGLOBAL CHALLENGES\\n\\nPROGRESS\\n\\nINTRODUCTION & OPPORTUNITIES\\n\\nGOVERNANCE TOWARD GOALS\\n\\nKPIs\\n\\nRECOGNITION\\n\\n19\\n\\nCSR GOVERNANCE & LEADERSHIP\\n\\nOur commitment to addressing environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues is embedded at every level of the company.

The Contributions Council and AT&T Foundation are comprised of senior executives charged with the supervision of our philanthropic investments.\\nMembers of the PPCRC come from diverse professional backgrounds, giving them the experience, depth of knowledge, judgment and vision needed to provide insight and guidance on policies and practices  as we work to address the breadth of ESG issues that can impact a complex enterprise like AT&T. They push us, challenge our assumptions and improve our work.\\n\\nIn addition to discussions with individual PPCRC members throughout the year, our Chief Sustainability Officer formally presents at scheduled committee meetings 3 times annually. With committee member guidance, we seek continuous improvement in areas such as climate resilience, privacy, political engagement, philanthropic giving, human rights, diversity, digital well-being and the education of our current and future workforce.\\nCSR GOVERNANCE\\n\\nAdditional Board of Directors committees oversee activities that impact ESG topics. For example, the Audit Committee reviews our cybersecurity and financial risk exposures and steps to control such risks. The Audit Committee also oversees internal controls as well as our corporate compliance program. And the Corporate Development and Finance Committee oversees capital investments and our implementation of key technology decisions.\\n\\nFoundational policies, including the codes of business conduct that govern our operating companies, put our values into action and detail our commitment to ethics, diversity, privacy, the environment and our communities.

This stakeholder engagement assessment provides insight into how AT&T should focus our resources, reporting and communications. We continuously monitor pressing and emerging ESG issues and current events, and prioritize programmatic and managerial efforts on those topics, as appropriate.\\nIn 2019, we conducted our 5th such assessment  which represents our global operations including WarnerMedia and Xandr  using a combination of electronic surveys and live interviews. Nearly 1,000 stakeholders provided insights and helped prioritize 29 ESG topics. These participants represented virtually every aspect of our business, including AT&T employees and officers across our operating companies, business and consumer customers, investors, suppliers, distributors, government and non-government organizations as well as programmatic and community organizations.\\n\\nReputation Measurement AT&T has developed an instrument to survey stakeholders and assess their perceptions of our corporate reputation and brand. On a monthly basis, the system measures AT&T\\'s overall reputation  or emotional attachment  among consumers who state they are familiar with our company\\'s operations. We\\'re able to measure interest and awareness of specific AT&T corporate responsibility programs and emerging social issues, and sample impressions of new programs under development.\\nOur measurements confirm that awareness of AT&T corporate responsibility efforts improves company reputation  which in turn positively affects key business metrics such as willingness to buy or recommend, and willingness to give AT&T the benefit of the doubt in times of difficulty.\\nLeadership Oversight The results of our ongoing stakeholder engagement efforts are reported to the CSR Governance Council and the Public Policy & Corporate Reputation Committee of the AT&T Board of Directors. The insights gained help guide our corporate responsibility strategy, improve business operations and policies, ensure transparent reporting, and prioritize programmatic investments and collaboration across the business.\\n\\nIn 2020, we plan to conduct assessments across our Latin American operations to gain additional, targeted insights that will further inform our work in those countries.\\n\\nRead more about the findings from our latest stakeholder engagement at about.att.com/ csr/reporting.\\n\\n2019 STAKEHOLDER ASSESSMENT TIER 1 PRIORITIES\\n\\nCustomer privacy\\nNetwork quality & reliability\\nTechnology innovation\\nAffordability & accessibility\\nTalent attraction, engagement & retention\\nBuilding digital skills\\n\\nNetwork data & security\\nEmployee diversity, equality & inclusion\\nEnergy efficiency & renewables\\nE-waste & product end-of-life management\\nClimate change & GHG emissions\\n\\nEnvironmental Governance/Economic\\n\\nSocial Workforce\\n2019/2020 AT&T CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUMMARY\\n\\nGLOBAL CHALLENGES\\n\\nPROGRESS\\n\\nINTRODUCTION & OPPORTUNITIES\\n\\nGOVERNANCE TOWARD GOALS\\n\\nKPIs\\n\\nRECOGNITION\\n\\n22\\n\\nCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTING\\n\\nEach year, we highlight ESG performance and progress toward publicly stated goals through robust corporate responsibility reporting.\\nOur objective is best-in-class transparency, and we strive to present data in a modular format that is responsive to a variety of stakeholder needs and interests.

Our political engagement decisions are grounded in our company values, codes of business conduct, AT&T public policy positions and the best interests of our business and employees  without regard to political party affiliation. The AT&T Board of Directors receives the full list of corporate political contributions and has an opportunity to review and provide guidance with respect to the company\\'s contributions.

We strive to use our economic, environmental, social and governance resources thoughtfully and responsibly. We\\'re a global company, and this report reflects our impact around the world as we work together for the benefit of people and our planet.\\nPatients come first at McKesson. Our vision is to improve care in every setting -- one product, one partner, one patient at a time. In this report, we share how we ensure that the products we handle and distribute, as well as those we manufacture in our private-label line of business, follow applicable regulations. We also describe how we create a better experience for patients, customers and manufacturers through Six Sigma, with more than 400 projects in Fiscal 2019 alone.\\nA Culture of Integrity and Operational Excellence McKesson plays a key role in helping deliver effective and efficient healthcare. But way we do business is as important as what we do. Compliance and ethics, and strong corporate governance, provide the cornerstones of our approach to corporate responsibility.\\nWe are deeply concerned by the impact the opioid epidemic is having on families and communities across the U.S. We are making progress on the corporate initiatives we announced in March 2018 to help address the opioid epidemic. We have worked with outside experts to help educate customers about compliance with regulations and how to identify warning signs of prescription abuse and potential diversion. We\\'ve offered thoughtful public policy recommendations, including the Prescription Safety Alert System (RxSAS) technology proposal,\\n\\nand supported innovative programs and partnerships that we believe can have a meaningful impact on this challenging issue. We also contributed $100 million to the Foundation for Opioid Response Efforts (FORE), an independently governed foundation focused on combating the crisis.\\nCommitted to Environmental Stewardship Using resources wisely is good for business, and it\\'s good for the environment. We continue to focus on reducing energy use and finding alternative sources of energy. In the U.S., we signed a long-term agreement to purchase power from solar arrays, and our warehouses in Belgium have used renewable energy since our Fiscal 2017. Besides recycling and reusing resources, we also support donation programs in Canada, Europe and the U.S., so unused products and supplies reach nonprofit organizations that can benefit from them. Spending wisely has also helped to lighten our environmental impact. This past year, we saw a substantial reduction in employee air travel, which led to an 11% reduction in Scope 3 CO2 emissions from the previous year.\\nSupporting Healthy Employees & Healthy Communities We\\'re committed to healthy employees and communities. That\\'s why we invest in programs to advance employee wellbeing and career growth. We have a culture of empowerment, recognition and belonging, and were recognized as one of the best employers for diversity.\\nOur employees have a passion for creating stronger communities. In the past year, McKesson employees supported 1,183 organizations, volunteering at the workplace and in their free time. We continue to grow the bone marrow registry through our multi-year drive, which has led to six transplants\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\n>Table of Contents|3\\nLetter from Brian Tyler\\nto date. When emergencies strike, we stand by our customers, communities and our employees. In Fiscal 2019, we expanded our employee relief fund to Canada and introduced $1,000 grants to provide evacuation assistance to employees facing a natural disaster. During the past year alone, the Fund supported 393 employees with more than $842,000 in grants. Our work is grounded in our shared ICARE (integrity, customerfirst, accountability, respect and excellence) principles. I invite you to review this report and learn how those principles guide us in making a positive impact for patients, the environment and our society every day.\\nBrian Tyler Chief Executive Officer, McKesson Corporation\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\n>Table of Contents|4\\nOur Approach to Corporate Responsibility\\n\\nMcKesson Corporation (McKesson) is a global leader in healthcare supply chain management solutions, retail pharmacy, community oncology and specialty care, and healthcare information technology. We partner with pharmaceutical manufacturers, providers, pharmacies, governments and other organizations in healthcare to help provide the right medicines, medical products and healthcare services to the right patients at the right time, safely and cost effectively.\\nIn FY19, we employed approximately 80,000 people, and our total revenues exceeded $214 billion. We operate primarily in the United States, Canada and Europe.\\nFor McKesson, corporate responsibility (CR) means better health for our planet and people everywhere. As a company, we\\'re working to use our economic, environmental, social and governance resources thoughtfully and responsibly. That way, we can make a positive impact on our company, our environment, and our society.\\nThe cornerstones of our approach to corporate responsibility are compliance and ethics and strong corporate governance.\\nCompliance and Ethics\\nAt McKesson, we believe that integrity is the foundation of our culture and is critical to our long-term success. We work to inspire and enable McKesson employees to act with integrity in all we do.\\nUnited by our ICARE shared principles Everything we do is driven by our shared principles, known as ICARE. These principles are a uniting force, connecting\\n\\nus across business units, geographies and functional areas. They shape our corporate culture. And they help us make a positive difference for patients, customers, partners, communities, shareholders and one another.\\nICARE is what we expect from each other, and what the people we touch expect from McKesson.\\nOur beacon: The McKesson Code of Conduct Our company operates in diverse business and regulatory environments. To ensure that all employees uphold the highest legal and ethical standards, we embed them in our Code of Conduct and require regular formal training on it.\\nA shared document across our company, our Code of Conduct is based on ICARE. It describes the fundamental principles, local policies and procedures that shape our work. It covers a wide range of topics that may occur when interacting with customers, industry partners and each other. It gives helpful guidance regarding where to turn in case of questions or concerns about the right thing to do. The Code of Conduct is available in 10 languages.\\nCompliance is integral to our culture Compliance is an integral part of our company and leadership culture. It refers to our obligation to laws, regulations and internal guidelines. For us, compliance is more than just following rules. It includes considering the actions we take, and adapting to new challenges and situations, always guided by our ICARE principles.\\nFor our culture to be sustainable, we need to involve everyone within the company. To meet the dynamic changes in this area, we continuously review our compliance management system and self-imposed standards.\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\n>Table of Contents|5\\nOur Approach to Corporate Responsibility\\n\\nHow we\\'re organized Our Chief Compliance Officer is aided by a Compliance and Ethics Group as well as a designated compliance officer for each of our businesses. The Chief Compliance Officer oversees and monitors implementation of our programs, including the standards and guidelines set out by regulators. Our compliance program includes:\\n Written policies and procedures\\n Compliance communications and web resources\\n Regulatory and compliance training\\n Internal auditing and compliance monitoring\\n A toll-free whistleblower hotline\\n Investigations relating to compliance and ethics\\n Corrective and/or preventive action, where necessary\\nIn FY19, our Board of Directors formed a standing Compliance Committee, whose purpose is to assist the Board in overseeing McKesson\\'s compliance programs and management\\'s identification and evaluation of our principal legal and regulatory compliance risks.\\nRaising concerns and seeking guidance Every employee is responsible for ensuring we comply with the laws, regulations and ethical standards affecting our business.\\nOur employees raise concerns if they believe something inappropriate is happening at work. Managers have a duty to listen to employees\\' concerns and react to those concerns in an appropriate manner. By fostering an open environment, where all employees feel free to speak up without any fear of retaliation, we seek to advance our culture of compliance and integrity.\\n\\nThe McKesson whistleblower hotlines are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, in multiple languages. It allows employees to raise concerns (anonymously if they wish), including possible violations of McKesson policies or other illegal or unethical activity. We investigate all allegations, and we provide reports of allegations and investigations to senior management and the Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors.\\nThe hotlines are only one of the ways employees can raise concerns. We encourage employees to contact their supervisor, business unit compliance officer or the Human Resources or Legal departments with any concerns. We strictly prohibit retaliation against an employee who makes a good faith complaint through any channel. After investigating, we develop a corrective plan as needed. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors also receives reports on any allegations and investigations regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or audit matters.\\nPreventing corruption We do not tolerate corruption or bribery in our business practices by our employees or by third parties working on our behalf. We don\\'t promise, offer or give anything of value to a government official or an employee or representative of our business partners with the intent to improperly influence their conduct. Similarly, we don\\'t receive anything of value that could be interpreted to improperly influence our conduct. We expect our business partners and third parties working on our behalf to comply with all applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and standards.\\nPreventing slavery in our supply chain McKesson is committed to the highest ethical standards. To fulfill these standards, we take steps to ensure that slavery and related human trafficking do not form part of our supply chain, consistent with the UK Modern Slavery Act.\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nCompliance is an integral part of our company and leadership culture. More than simply following rules, it means considering our actions and adapting to new challenges and situations, always guided by our ICARE principles.\\n>Table of Contents|6\\nOur Approach to Corporate Responsibility\\n\\nServing government customers As one of the largest government contractors in the U.S., McKesson is proud to partner with government customers to meet the healthcare needs of veterans, active military, children and disadvantaged groups. McKesson recognizes that our government customers face unique challenges and obligations, and we are dedicated to helping our customers suceed. Our Compliance and Ethics program is critical to the success of our government contracts.\\nOur Take on Good Governance\\nA balanced corporate governance approach aims to strengthen confidence in our company -- both in the capital markets and among the public -- and creates value over the long term. We know that good corporate governance advances trust among our shareholders, business partners and employees, promotes transparency in our company, and contributes to sustainable growth.\\nHere\\'s a look at our practices and processes for running our company responsibly.\\nWe have an Independent Board Chair Edward Mueller, previously Lead Independent Director, took over as Independent Chair of McKesson\\'s Board of Directors on April 1, 2019. He has been a member of the Board of Directors since April 2008 and the Lead Independent Director since July 2013.\\nOur Board champions diversity and inclusion Every company should bring together diversity of thought. At the time of publication, three of our ten directors are women and two of our directors are persons of color. Since 2002, women have held three seats on our Board.\\n\\nAnnual evaluations keep our Board going strong Our Independent Board Chair conducts annual performance evaluations for every one of our Board members. That way, we make sure all of our leaders are committed to McKesson\\'s values and future.\\nWe plan for what\\'s next in leadership Our Board reviews and provides input on our succession plan for developing our next generation of leaders, our CEO and executive officers. During FY19, the Board unanimously selected Brian Tyler, then president and chief operating officer of the company, to succeed John Hammergren as CEO, effective April 1, 2019. Brian is a 22-year McKesson veteran who has led nearly every major business within the company as well as McKesson\\'s corporate strategy and business development unit.\\nKey governance attributes include proxy access and the right to call a special meeting When our shareholders hold at least 3% of the company\\'s stock for at least three years, they can nominate director candidates to fill up to 20% of available Board seats. We also allow record holders who have held at least 15% of our outstanding shares for at least one year to call a special meeting of stockholders.\\nWe tell you about our political contributions and lobbying activities Transparency and accountability matter to us. In the U.S., we voluntarily disclose corporate political contributions and file reports on lobbying activities where required by law. Additionally, we provide a list of trade associations with annual payments more than $50,000. We also prohibit trade organizations from using our contributions for political purposes. In 2019, we further enhanced our political contributions and lobbying policy for the third consecutive year in response to shareholder feedback and include more prominent disclosure of our public policy approach and priorities.\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nAs one of the largest government contractors in the U.S., McKesson is proud to partner with government customers to meet the healthcare needs of veterans, active military, children and disadvantaged groups.\\nSince 2002, women have held three seats on our Board.\\n>Table of Contents|7\\nOur Approach to Corporate Responsibility\\n\\nRisk oversight is a top priority The entire Board and their committees work to understand and review our corporate risks. They oversee everything from our reputation and legal and financial reporting risk to compensation practices and cybersecurity.\\nWe have a global Code of Conduct As described earlier in this report, our Code of Conduct is where we detail the policies and procedures that shape our work. It helps our entire team make ethical decisions. We\\'ve adapted and translated our code to make sure it works in every place we do.\\nGuidelines help us keep up with governance Our Corporate Governance Guidelines set forth our Board\\'s goal of building long-term value for our stockholders and are consistent with New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing requirements. Our guidelines call for the Board to monitor the performance of our company, including with respect to Environmental, Social and Governance matters, and our guidelines. They include things like:\\n Director qualification standards\\n Access to management and independent advisors\\n Compensation\\n Director orientation\\n Continuing education\\n Management succession\\n\\nOur Board members are independent Other than CEO Brian Tyler, every one of our Board members is independent, which follows the NYSE requirements and our Corporate Governance Guidelines.\\nThe Board reviews our corporate responsibility practices The Board of Directors periodically reviews our company\\'s corporate responsibility practices, including environmental sustainability, pay equity and diversity and inclusion.\\nWe do more to earn trust  We do not have a poison pill.\\n We eliminated supermajority voting requirements.\\n We have a majority voting standard for uncontested director elections.\\nIf you have any questions about McKesson\\'s governance, let us know.\\n\\nWe\\'ve adapted and translated our Code of Conduct to make sure it works every place we do.\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\n>Table of Contents|8\\nOur Approach to Corporate Responsibility\\n\\nHow We Put Together This Report\\nIn FY18, we worked with our stakeholders on a materiality assessment, which is a process to identify and prioritize potential topics that could affect our company.\\nThe assessment included in-depth interviews and surveys with 95 stakeholders from Canada, Europe and the U.S. They included employees, customers, suppliers, industry associations, government agencies, NGOs and joint venture partners. We involved senior leaders from multiple business units and corporate functions and sought out the perspectives of our shareholders.\\nWe also brought in peer benchmarking, impact mapping, synthesis and analysis of our results. The work resulted in a materiality matrix, validated with internal leaders, and a list of prioritized topics and opportunities raised through the materiality process.\\nThrough the assessment, we identified the following topics as particularly material to McKesson: product quality and patient safety; eco-efficient transport and operations; ethics and compliance; partnerships and engagement; access to healthcare and community health; and employee recruitment, engagement and retention. Based on the assessment, we developed a global corporate responsibility report that puts emphasis on the following three topics:\\n1. Product quality and patient safety\\n2. Eco-efficient transportation and operation\\n3. Better health for employees and communities\\nYou\\'ll find a section on each as you keep reading.\\n\\nWhat is Corporate Responsibility?\\n\\nProduct Quality & Patient Safety\\nManaging Risk\\n Ensuring a sustainable future of healthcare  Collaborating with our partners\\n\\nOUR VISION\\nBetter Health for All\\n\\nEco-Efficiency\\nReducing Footprint and Cost\\n Reducing our environmental footprint  Finding smart solutions\\n\\nBetter Health\\nAdvancing Care for All\\n Investing in patients, colleagues and customer success\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\n>Table of Contents|9\\nOur Approach to Corporate Responsibility\\nWhat you\\'ll find here This report is a deep dive into our corporate responsibility efforts during FY19 (April 1, 2018, to March 31, 2019).

It\\'s crucial to deliver the safest products to all of these patients, because both the people making the medicine and the people taking it count on us.\\nResponding to the opioid epidemic in the U.S. Each day, our distribution team delivers life-saving medicines to pharmacies, hospitals and clinics that serve millions of Americans. We take to heart that at the end of each and every item delivered -- every pill bottle, every vial, every ointment -- there is a patient in need. We know that it\\'s not just a package, it\\'s a patient.\\nOver the past decade, as the opioid epidemic evolved rapidly, we enhanced our teams, processes and technologies dedicated to preventing diversion. We are committed to maintaining -- and continuously enhancing -- strong programs designed to detect and prevent opioid diversion within the pharmaceutical supply chain, while also protecting the availability of appropriate treatments for patients with serious illnesses and injuries.\\nThis complicated, multi-faceted public health crisis must be addressed through a comprehensive and collaborative approach. Each participant in the pharmaceutical supply chain can play an important role.\\nWe have advanced a series of company initiatives focused on helping to address the opioid epidemic, including launching a foundation dedicated to combating the crisis, offering thoughtful public policy recommendations -- including the Prescription Safety-Alert System (RxSAS) technology proposal -- to supporting innovative programs and partnerships that we believe can have a meaningful impact on this challenging issue.\\n\\nWe are committed to engaging with all who share our dedication to acting with urgency to address this epidemic and working together to end this national crisis.\\nEnsuring products are safe and high quality Our quality management system is based on international procedures to ensure that products we handle and distribute, as well as the products we manufacture in our private-label line of business, follow applicable regulations.\\n\\nTransportation\\n\\nManufacturer\\n\\nDistribution Center\\n\\nCustomer/ Patient\\n\\nTransportation\\n\\nHospital/ Pharmacy\\n\\nMcKesson Taking Action Learn more about how we are doing our part in The Fight Against Opioid Abuse.\\nOur corporate responsibility strategy focuses on how our business affects society and the environment. We look at each part of the supply chain.\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\n>Table of Contents|11\\nProduct Quality and Patient Safety Come First\\n Compliance: We comply with applicable laws and regulations concerning product quality in the countries where we do business. These include the Drug Supply Chain Security Act in the U.S., the Food and Drugs Act in Canada, and the Good Distribution Practice and Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines in Europe.\\nThese laws and regulations commit us to keeping our products traceable, handling hazardous products appropriately and continuing to work with authorized trading partners.\\n Product integrity: Our supply chain security, safety and security-training programs focus on the integrity of product packaging and containers. Here\\'s how:\\n When receiving products, we verify the quantity, supplier name and product name through the purchase order. We also make sure that the product is not set to expire soon. Our tracking system automatically lets us know if a supply is affected by a recall.\\n When shipping products, we use containers that maintain quality and safety and ensure appropriate temperature control. To manage cold chain products, we use sophisticated technology for environmental controls and temperature monitoring. Refrigeration experts ensure we select shipping containers that comply with manufacturers\\' product specifications. When we use passive cold chain solutions, we require containers to pass a qualification process. This helps guarantee product integrity and prevent any quality issues.\\n When potential incidents happen, we work to respond promptly. We follow a Corrective Action  Preventive Action (CAPA) process. To prevent counterfeit products from\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nWe ship products in containers that ensure the integrity and quality of the drug are maintained at all times.\\n\\n>Table of Contents|12\\nProduct Quality and Patient Safety Come First\\n\\nentering the legal distribution network, we follow a supplier qualification procedure for vendors. As part of this process, we perform regular audits and checks of authorizations and certifications.\\n During product recalls, we reach out to pharmacies and other customers with details on the recall and how products can be returned to McKesson. We continuously train our customer service employees so they are up-to-date on current recalls.\\n Traceability: In Europe, we follow the Falsified Medicines Directive, which requires batch tracking of certain medicinal products. When products enter the warehouse, we record the product code, expiration date and batch number. Using handheld terminals, we track the product at every stage of its journey in the warehouse -- from replenishment, to picking, to returns. If an inaccuracy occurs, the tracking system generates an alert. Our quality coordinators monitor the alerts and resolve any inconsistencies.\\n Supplier requirements: Just as we hold ourselves accountable, we also hold our suppliers accountable for the quality of their products and services. In areas where we outsource distribution, this includes contracted carriers and couriers.\\nIn the U.S., Canada and Europe, suppliers meet our requirements through compliance with regional, national and international legislation. For other regions, please see \"Responsible sourcing\" below.\\n Manufacturer requirements: We comply with manufacturer requirements for handling and distributing products. In some cases, we have contracts with manufacturers that restrict the sale of certain medicines to certain customers, such as\\n\\nprison systems and others, for lethal injections. McKesson is committed to helping manufacturers implement their policies in this area. The needs and requirements of various manufacturers are different, so our contractual commitments, controls and processes vary by manufacturer. McKesson has processes and systems to enable manufacturers to validate our performance against our contractual arrangements.\\nWhen we manage quality, our guide isn\\'t only laws and regulations but also best practices and international standards. For example, 10 of our businesses in Europe are ISO 9001 certified. ISO 9001 is an international standard for quality management systems.\\nResponsible sourcing We work with private-label suppliers outside the U.S., Canada and the European Union. Those suppliers must agree to McKesson Sustainable Supply Chain Principles (MSSP). The MSSP covers compliance with appropriate laws along with adherence to our strict policies on protecting workers, preparing for emergencies, identifying and managing environmental risk, and protecting the environment. These principles reflect our stance against forced and child labor, which we articulate in our response to the UK Modern Slavery Act.\\nIn the U.S. and Canada, before we place the first order with a new supplier, we conduct desktop or on-site audits depending on a risk matrix analysis. These audits cover all MSSP areas. On-site audits include document review, a factory tour and interviews with workers. In either case, we document the findings and require a corrective action plan for any instances of non-compliance.\\nAdherence by suppliers to MSSP is not optional. McKesson Global Procurement & Sourcing Limited (MGPSL) is stringent in regard to remediation efforts. These are made by suppliers\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nWhen we manage quality, our guide is not only laws and regulations but also best practices and international standards.\\n>Table of Contents|13\\nProduct Quality and Patient Safety Come First\\nwhen audits reveal any gaps in working conditions, health and safety, or environmental standards. To maintain high sustainable principles standards in factories we purchase products from, we follow up periodically on initial audits and closely monitor corrective actions.\\nWhen issues are identified, McKesson auditors work with the supplier to ensure improvements are made. These audits include interviews with workers and management, inspections of production sites, and document reviews. Audit findings or non-conformances are prioritized based on risk. Should a critical issue be identified, MGPSL would require a timely response from the supplier. If a supplier failed to adequately remediate the issue, the relationships would be re-evaluated and, if necessary, terminated.\\nQuality improvement through Six Sigma Across McKesson, we strive to continuously improve by using Six Sigma. Six Sigma helps us work better by using data to drive decision making and promote continuous quality improvement across our company. Using problem-solving tools, Six Sigma reduces defects and minimizes variances.\\nBy improving processes, we can see fewer errors, faster cycle time and less waste.\\nIn FY19, McKesson completed 405 Six Sigma projects, which had more than $160 million in cost savings and avoidance across our company, suppliers and customers.\\nOne of Six Sigma\\'s key objectives is to train, coach, and mentor employee talent, in order to deepen the operational excellence culture across McKesson. In FY19, employees in the countries covered by our centralized learning management system completed 1,269 Six Sigma training courses.\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nSix Sigma helps us work better by using data to drive decision making and by promoting continuous quality improvement across our company.\\n\\n>Table of Contents|14\\nProduct Quality and Patient Safety Come First\\n\\nHere are a few of our Six Sigma projects:\\n Driving enhanced value through the supply chain: In FY19, the U.S. Six Sigma team completed five customer and supplier engagements that focused on the supply chain, from enhancing communication with the customers and suppliers to increasing service level metrics and improving cycle time for resolution of open items.\\n Reducing paper by going digital: In 2018, a Lean Six Sigma Green Belt project paved the way into the digital future: When medicines are delivered, there is a number of documents that must be printed out and enclosed with the delivery according to fullfill official requirements. The Portuguese LSS colleagues challenged those requirements in order to make a step towards the future. The idea: Saving paper consumed by digitizing the documents. In order to get green light for this aimed change the project team closely collaborated with the Portuguese legal authorities. Although the official requirements initially insisted on the printed version, the Portuguese team was able to convince the authorities to digitize this step. This LSS initiative has a positive impact on the company\\'s carbon footprint and was well as on the pharmacies receiving the digital documents, who now have less paper waste.\\n Tracking to better control precursor returns: Precursors are products with active pharmaceutical ingredients that can be used to make illegal drugs, such as methamphetamine. As part of McKesson Canada\\'s commitment to Health Canada, Six Sigma led a team to create an automated tracking system. It provides visibility along each step of a precursor return -- from when the product is created and shipped to the customer to when the physical return comes back into the McKesson building for processing.\\n\\nThese are just a few of our Six Sigma successes. Whether it\\'s reducing defects or streamlining processes, we look forward to tackling additional projects in FY20 and beyond.\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nIn FY19, McKesson completed 405 Six Sigma projects, which had more than $160 million in cost savings and avoidance across our company, suppliers and customers.\\n>Table of Contents|15\\nEco-Efficient Operations and Transportation\\nCommunities thrive in a healthier environment. That\\'s why we\\'re sharpening our focus on environmental sustainability. Establishing new environmental best practices is a priority across McKesson businesses. We work to capture the metrics most relevant to our lines of business and act on recommendations that lead to a healthier environment. We use electricity for lighting and IT. We also use fuel for heating and transportation, including inbound and outbound distribution and business travel. We focus on efficiency across these areas. In our distribution centers and pharmacies, we focus on reducing energy use and finding alternative sources of energy. As a company focused on distribution, transportation is important to us -- in particular, fuel efficiency for our fleet.\\nReducing Energy Use in Our Facilities\\nAcross our locations, we work to use less energy for lighting and heating. Increasing LED lighting to lessen our footprint Our buildings use energy mainly for lighting. In our distribution centers, lighting accounts for up to 40% of the electricity consumption. In our pharmacies, it\\'s approximately 5070%. With more efficient lighting, we can cut our CO2 emissions and reduce our carbon footprint. During FY19, we implemented initiatives to add LED lighting in our distribution centers, pharmacies and offices. Through these initiatives, we expect to see energy reductions of up to 40%. Our European distribution centers expect to save more than 3,300 tons of CO2 emissions per year through LED lighting alone.\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nOur Sustainability Initiatives\\n\\n1 Increasing LED lighting across facilities\\n\\n2 Monitoring and benchmarking energy use\\n\\n3 Pursuing environmental certification\\n\\n4\\n\\nReducing movement of inventory through our redistribution center model\\n\\n5 Recycling and reusing resources\\n\\n4 5\\n\\n3 2\\n1\\n>Table of Contents|16\\nEco-Efficient Operations and Transportation\\n\\nWhile we\\'re bringing LED lighting to more than 350 pharmacies in Europe, we\\'re also replacing inefficient heating systems with more efficient units, complete with timer controls and/or presence detectors. This initiative follows a successful pilot, where we helped 50 pharmacies save energy equal to 200 tons of CO2 emissions yearly.\\nMonitoring and benchmarking energy use We use a number of tools to benchmark our energy use, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\\'s Energy Star Portfolio Manager. In many distribution centers, we also monitor energy consumption by production line, which helps us find more opportunities to conserve and cut energy use.\\nBringing in renewable energy to move toward the future In our warehouses in Belgium, we switched from purchasing electricity that was generated from traditional sources to renewable energy from FY17 onward. Three of these Belgian warehouses are equipped with solar panels and generate approximately 700 MWh of clean electricity every year.\\nIn the U.S., we signed a long-term agreement to purchase solar power from solar arrays. We began installing these arrays in West Sacramento, California, during FY19. We expect the agreement to reduce costs for McKesson, producing electricity equal to approximately 74% of the West Sacramento facility\\'s annual consumption.\\nWorking toward environmental certifications as we grow As part of our energy reduction strategy, we pursue environmental certification for new and newly renovated buildings. For example, our European headquarters in Stuttgart was recognized by the German Sustainable Business Council for its environmentallyfriendly design. Our U.S. offices in San Francisco, California;\\n\\nIrving, Texas; The Woodlands, Texas; and Richmond, Virginia are Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified, as is our distribution center in Aurora, Illinois; we are pursuing LEED certification for our Scottsdale, Arizona; Jacksonville, Florida; and Columbus, Ohio offices. We also hold WELL certification for our Irving and Richmond offices and are pursuing it in Columbus, Jacksonville and Scottsdale.\\nTransportation: More Efficiency, Less Impact More output with less energy input -- this is the principle of energy efficiency. It makes perfect business sense because we save money by reducing our energy needs. At the same time, we reduce our impact on the environment by using fewer resources, which means we emit less CO2.\\nTransportation in our operations We\\'re an international business focused on distribution. For us, fuel consumption for transportation is an environmental challenge and opportunity. Our strategy focuses on optimizing delivery routes and the use of delivery vehicles. To do that, we monitor mileage and fuel consumption, and we educate our drivers on eco-efficient driving.\\nEnergy reduction for outsourced fleets In areas where we outsource transportation, we take advantage of external carriers\\' ability to optimize schedules and avoid returning empty trucks to distribution centers. We also work with customers to adjust delivery schedules to be more efficient.\\nEnergy reduction for our in-house fleet In some areas, we own our fleet. When buying new vehicles, key criteria are fuel consumption and low CO2 emissions -- while adhering to high quality standards. We teach our drivers environmentally friendly and safe practices, such as driving\\n\\nOur U.S. offices in San Francisco, California; Irving, Texas; The Woodlands, Texas; and Richmond, Virginia are LEED certified.\\nIn our warehouses in Belgium, we switched from purchasing ordinary electricity to 100% renewable energy starting in FY17.\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\n>Table of Contents|17\\nEco-Efficient Operations and Transportation\\nat a safe speed limit and avoiding idling. We also adjust delivery routes and vehicle loading to cut mileage and increase efficiency. Our fleet in Canada\\'s Quebec province has already seen the impact:  Equipment upgrades: We have a multi-year initiative to\\nupgrade our line-haul tractors and 5-ton vehicles. The annual fuel reduction is approximately 95,000 liters.  Using LCVs: We use long combination vehicles (LCV) in our line-haul network in Quebec. LCVs use less fuel to carry goods, which reduces our carbon footprint. Redistribution Center model We operate National Redistribution Centers (NRDCs) in the U.S. and France. These centers help us to better manage our inventory and reduce redundancies. Even better, they help us reduce the movement of our inventory. In turn, we can save on costs and fuel within our distribution center network. Employee travel and commuting For travel to the office, we encourage employees to use sustainable options, like bikes or buses. In North America and several European countries, McKesson also offers commuter benefits, which let employees use pre-tax dollars to pay for items like subway cards or train tickets. In Canada, our Montreal office has reserved parking spaces for people who carpool. Several sites in Canada and Europe offer electric/hybrid car charging stations. While business travel is part of how we work, it also affects the environment. To reduce our impact, we encourage employees to use tele- and video-conferencing whenever possible to reduce travel and, by extension, our carbon footprint.\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nWe\\'re upgrading the tractors in our line-haul network in Canada. The annual fuel reduction is approximately 95,000 liters.\\n\\n>Table of Contents|18\\nEco-Efficient Operations and Transportation\\n\\nC02 Emissions Performance in FY19\\n Scope 1: Direct emissions from the consumption of natural gas, heating oil, diesel fuel and gasoline. Our Scope 1 emissions increased by 25% from FY18. We believe that an important factor was a particularly cold winter in North America, which increased use of heating oil. The number of sites reporting natural gas consumption also increased. However, we saw a decrease in fuel consumption in our fleet, which we attribute to increased use of hybrid vehicles.\\n Scope 2: Emissions from purchased and consumed electricity and long-distance heating consumption. Our Scope 2 emissions decreased by 3% from FY18, driven by a decrease in electricity consumption in Europe and the U.S.\\n Scope 3: In FY19, we saw a substantial reduction in employee air travel, which led to an 11% reduction in CO2 emissions from FY18. These figures reflect air travel booked through our corporate travel partners.\\nWe measure CO2 emissions using the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.\\n\\nScope 1: Fuel consumption for in-house Pharmaceutical Solutions & Services, Medical-Surgical, Canada and Europe fleets; natural gas consumption in U.S., Canada and Europe facilities; heating oil in Canada and Europe facilities\\nScope 2: Electricity Consumption in U.S., Canada and Europe Facilities\\nScope 3: U.S., Canada and Europe employee air travel; third-party transportation\\n\\nFY18 CO2 emissions\\n(metric tons)\\n\\nFY19 CO2 emissions\\n(metric tons)\\n\\n124,911\\n\\n157,076\\n\\n178,385 75,506\\n\\n173,390 67,114\\n\\nConserving Resources in Our Daily Work\\nWe use a variety of resources in our work. Besides power sources, we use office paper, packaging, water and materials related to distribution. We do our best to use only what we need. When we can\\'t avoid using resources, we strive to use recycled products.\\n\\nUse of resources: FY18FY19* Material Recycled\\n\\nFY18: U.S. and Canada 15,307 tons\\n\\nMaterials to Landfill\\n\\nNot reported\\n\\nWater use\\n\\n366,786,967 liters\\n\\n*For all locations reporting recycling and/or water use data\\n\\nFY19: U.S., Canada and Europe 48,147 tons 19,129 tons 633,370,008 liters\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\n>Table of Contents|19\\nEco-Efficient Operations and Transportation\\n\\nResource scarcity doesn\\'t affect only McKesson. Companies that aim to stay competitive in the long term must work toward closed-loop systems and use their resources responsibly. This approach makes sense from both an economic and an ecological point of view.\\nTo reduce our impact on the environment, we continuously improve the way we handle resources for our products, our services and our processes.\\nTo hold ourselves accountable, we report on the total weight of materials that were recycled and went to landfill, and on water use. In FY19, we added data from Europe. This will represent our new baseline for reporting.\\nReducing water use Water is a limited resource so we seek to reduce its use in our operations.\\nOne way we\\'re limiting water use is by expanding smart irrigation programs in our facilities. This system adjusts watering times based on weather conditions and lets us check our water use remotely. Users can receive notifications about changes to the settings or equipment malfunctions. Automation saves water because the irrigation system runs less often, and it is easier to identify problems. During FY19, we expanded smart irrigation programs to include five sites and saved enough water to fill 4.4 Olympic swimming pools each year.\\nHazardous waste In the U.S., our Hazardous and Regulated Waste Management Program establishes standards to identify and manage hazardous and regulated waste and handle hazardous and regulated waste spills. Through the program, we make sure that accumulation and disposal of waste from McKesson facilities complies with international, national and regional regulations.\\n\\nWhen it comes to e-waste, we partner with certified suppliers for both leased and non-leased assets. Leased electronic assets make up the bulk of our portfolio. Upon return, most are wiped clean and reused. If they can\\'t be reused, the parts are recycled. In Germany, we work with AfB to ensure that electronic assets are either resold or recycled. AfB is Europe\\'s first nonprofit IT company, and it focuses on providing employment opportunities for disabled workers.\\nWe also report on total hazardous waste for McKesson Europe. In FY19, we generated 1,474 tons of hazardous waste, an increase from 750 tons in FY18. We believe this increase is due to more complete reporting across business lines and represents a new baseline.\\nTransport of reusable containers In many of our businesses, we send medication to customers -- including pharmacies and hospitals -- in reusable containers. After the containers are unloaded and emptied at their destination, we use them for the next delivery. Our return system guarantees a smooth pick-up process. By reusing containers, we save valuable resources and avoid unnecessary waste every day.\\nGreen decommissioning When consolidating office space or moving to a new location, furniture can often go to landfill. In FY19, we partnered with a vendor that recycles, resells and donates furniture instead. To date, we have completed projects in Houston, Texas; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and San Francisco, California. In the San Francisco project alone, we diverted 90 tons of waste and donated more than $38,000 of furniture to local nonprofits. The estimated CO2 offset as of the end of FY19 was 432 tons.\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nDuring FY19, smart irrigation programs expanded to five sites and saved enough water to fill 4.4 Olympic swimming pools each year.\\n>Table of Contents|20\\nEco-Efficient Operations and Transportation\\n\\nReducing paper use in our operations By going digital, we\\'re using less paper. Our initiatives range from paperless invoices and two-sided printing, which will cut printing by 34 million sheets of paper, to electronic handheld scanners for packing orders in distribution centers. Our Canada distribution centers will all implement paperless paystubs by the end of FY20. When we can\\'t avoid using paper, we encourage use of recycled stock.\\nDonating unused medications and products to support patients Part of conserving resources means ensuring that unused medications and medical supplies go to people and organizations that can benefit from them.\\n When people purchase medications and don\\'t use them, valuable products can turn into trash. A group of pharmacists from Italy\\'s LloydsFarmacia decided to do something about that. They joined forces with the City of Bologna, the regional health authority and other pharmacies to form Farmaco Amico. They invite customers to bring in unused medications that are valid for at least six more months and in unopened packages. A nonprofit partner collects and sorts the products. Then the products go to organizations serving patients without access to healthcare, in Italy and beyond. Narcotics, medications that need refrigeration, and free samples aren\\'t included in the program. AIFA, Italy\\'s national prescription drug agency, monitors the process.\\n\\n Through our partnership with World Vision, McKesson\\'s Medical-Surgical business donated 229 pallets of supplies during FY19. These donations helped support important health initiatives in seven countries. They include programs that screen and treat young children in Somalia for malnutrition and promote better access to care for pregnant and nursing women in Zambia.\\n The returns teams at several distribution centers in Canada collect returned or damaged products and arrange for them to be donated to nonprofit outreach programs. They reduce waste while supporting their local communities.\\nComplying with laws and regulations Our environmental commitment begins by adhering to all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Just as we take great care in the safety and security of our products, services and people, we are careful and thoughtful to minimize the effect of our company operations on the environment.\\nDuring the period covered by this report (April 1, 2018, through March 31, 2019), McKesson was in material compliance with all applicable environmental regulations.\\n\\nIn FY19, McKesson\\'s Medical-Surgical business donated 229 pallets of supplies, supporting important health initiatives in seven countries.\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\n>Table of Contents|21\\nCreating Better Health for Our Employees and Communities\\n\\nOur vision for a healthier world begins with patients and extends to our employees.

Labor laws and practices vary among the countries where we do business, and we are committed to following all applicable labor laws and regulations in those countries, including those governing labor-management relationships.\\nAdvancing employee well-being We offer programs that advance the physical, mental, financial and social well-being of our employees and their families. We focus on engaging all, and we measure our success through the annual global Employee Opinion Survey.\\nWe know healthcare systems are different in different countries, and our programs reflect that. For example, in Canada and the U.S., our programs include an annual health review, an interactive wellness portal and an employee assistance program. In those countries, we also provide free fitness trackers that connect to an online wellness platform, organize health challenges, and maintain a network of employee Wellness Champions. We also help employees plan for retirement, whether they\\'re far along in their career or just starting out.\\n\\nOpportunities to grow McKesson wants our employees to be excited about their careers, so we invest heavily in employee growth and development. That means rewarding job assignments, one-on-one feedback from managers and opportunities for continued learning.\\nWhen it comes to career development, we focus on shared goals and individualized feedback. Each goal ladders up to our overriding goal: to improve care in every setting -- one product, one partner, one patient at a time. We establish clear goals and regularly measure their achievement, and compensation increases are tied to their success. We encourage managers to provide ongoing coaching through discussions and quarterly check-in meetings. Through this process, managers provided formal feedback on 94% of eligible employees in the U.S. and Canada.\\nTraining is important to career development. It helps employees succeed in their roles and prepares them for new challenges. It strengthens managers\\' coaching and management skills. Besides classroom training, we also offer classes through telepresence and fully online on-demand courses, so employees can learn when it fits their schedules. In FY19, our employees completed more than 290,000 hours of training (across the countries that are included in our centralized learning management platform, including Canada, the U.S., and some employees in the UK and Ireland).\\nWe are always on the lookout for high-potential employees, and we have processes to help them advance.

That\\'s why we incorporate health and safety into all parts of our operations.\\nWe start by being proactive. Our Security and Safety department in the U.S. continually monitors our environment to identify potential risks, so we can prevent and mitigate them. That includes having procedures in place and investing in equipment for physical and electronic security.\\nIn North America, we routinely assess all of our key facilities to make sure they follow our established security and safety standards. If we identify a vulnerability, we document it and the facility prepares a plan to address it. Across distribution facilities, we prepare a monthly Leading Safety Indicator Dashboard to measure conformance to our standards.\\nIn FY19, our distribution centers in the U.S. had a 96.9% effectiveness rate in core injury-prevention programs, including joint health and safety committees, periodic self-inspections, and employee training.\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nIn FY20, we will continue to provide a safe and secure work environment for our employees and, by extension, for the customers and patients who depend on us.\\n\\n>Table of Contents|24\\nCreating Better Health for Our Employees and Communities\\n\\nReducing workplace injuries The first step to reducing workplace injuries is preventing them. In distribution centers, we focus on initiatives like safe lifting and pre-shift stretching. We focus on ergonomic design, as well as slip, trip and fall prevention.\\nIn the U.S., injury rates (number of recordable injuries per 100 employees) improved in both distribution centers and offices during FY19. Total recordable injuries declined by 11% and losttime injuries declined by 15%. In Canada, the injury frequency rate remained the same from FY18 and the severity index declined. In FY19, we gathered safety data from Europe as a baseline, and plan to expand safety reporting to include Europe starting with our FY20 corporate responsibility report.\\nTraining is the cornerstone of safety Across McKesson North America, we foster a \"working together, protecting together\" culture. Our safety training programs are for employees at all levels. Throughout their time at McKesson, employees learn to identify and control hazards they may encounter at work or at home. They also receive specialized training related to their role, environment or the equipment they use. Just as we continually update our processes, we update and add new training programs, and we train managers to coach employees on safe work practices. In FY19, U.S. employees completed over 25,000 safety training courses.\\nIn FY20, we will continue to provide a safe and secure work environment for our employees and, by extension, for the customers and patients who depend on us.\\n\\nAccess to Healthcare\\nAcross our company, we champion programs that help people access quality healthcare at a lower cost. Here are a few examples:\\n Bringing online doctors to patients: In the UK, our LloydsPharmacy business offers online access to healthcare. Patients go to the website, choose a medication they would like to receive, and answer a series of questions. That information is examined by a doctor, who runs it through a sophisticated clinical algorithm that determines if it is safe to prescribe the medication. If the doctor needs to know more, he or she can send a personalized message to the patient in seconds. After the doctor approves the medication, he or she electronically signs the prescription. Patients can opt to either pick it up or have it delivered to their home. To keep the algorithms as safe and efficient as possible, they\\'re constantly updated. Besides convenience and less wait time, this service gives patients discretion for sensitive topics, such as hair-loss treatment and sexual health.\\n Bringing electronic health records to First Nations families: In Canada, Jordan\\'s Principle is a legal rule designed to make sure First Nations families have equal access to healthcare. The Cowichan Tribes of Vancouver Island realized that without access to their own health information, it would be difficult to take an active role in their own healthcare. That\\'s why they partnered with McKesson Canada\\'s RelayHealth on Closing the Circle of Care. The project honors the tribes\\' teachings, which include working collectively for improved health. With RelayHealth, tribe members now have secure access to their health records, along with the ability to directly message their healthcare providers online.\\n\\nBy helping people access quality healthcare at lower cost, we help make better health possible.\\nIn the U.S., McKesson\\'s Health Mart business supports more than 5,000 pharmacies across the country, with nearly 30% located in rural communities.\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\n>Table of Contents|25\\nCreating Better Health for Our Employees and Communities\\n\\n Caring for patients in rural settings: Rural areas often have an older population with a greater need for managing medications, yet they have less access to pharmacy services. In the U.S., McKesson\\'s Health Mart business supports more than 5,000 pharmacies across the country, with nearly 30% located in rural communities. Health Mart is a franchise program that helps independent pharmacies compete with chain and mail-order pharmacies. McKesson helps Health Mart pharmacies get competitive reimbursement rates. Other services include branding, in-store marketing advice and peer support. Keeping rural pharmacies healthy is only part of the story. In many communities, the pharmacist is the first line of defense for patients. Yet regulations are inconsistent across U.S. states. For example, pharmacists can give vaccinations in some states but not in others. In the U.S., McKesson advocates with policymakers for consistent licensing rules across states. The goal is to make care more accessible -- and help shift it to lower-cost settings.\\nCaring for Our Communities\\nGiving back is a great way to build healthier communities. We provide opportunities that encourage and support employee volunteering and giving. Our programs are built to reflect our focus on better care, whether that means celebrating our Community Heroes or responding to emergencies.\\nGiving back, with a focus on better health In 2019, McKesson launched and seeded with $100 million, a national, private, grantmaking foundation focused solely on advancing solutions to the opioid crisis. FORE, the Foundation for Opioid Response Efforts, works to identify actions that can be taken to stem the epidemic and drive meaningful solutions,\\n\\nsuch as focusing on education for patients, caregivers and providers; addressing key policy issues; and increasing access to life-saving treatments. It is overseen by a board mostly comprised of outside directors, including healthcare and subject-matter experts, to ensure FORE\\'s work reflects diverse perspectives and approaches to addressing this epidemic.\\nIn FY19, McKesson Corporation contributed $2.3 million in cash and merchandise to support a variety of charitable organizations in the U.S., Canada and Europe. The McKesson Foundation disbursed more than $3.7 million to support cancer care and employees\\' community engagement efforts across the U.S. and Canada.\\nHere are some of the areas we focused on in FY19:\\n Supporting cancer patients: In North America, the McKesson Foundation works with a network of Cancer Care Community Partners. These nonprofits are located near where our employees live and work. We support these partners through Giving Comfort, a charity program that has provided care packages to more than 76,000 cancer patients.\\nEmployees create the care packages during Community Days, an annual volunteering event that drew 16,750 employees in 150 locations in FY19. By volunteering, employees also earn McKesson Foundation grants for their local Community Partner.\\nThey also support the partners through McKesson in Motion, a charity wellness challenge that engaged more than 10,500 employees. During the challenge, employees completed workouts to support the fight against cancer. By participating, they earned McKesson Foundation grants for our Community Partners -- just as they do for Community Days.\\n\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nFor the past three years, LloydsApotek has made annual donations to Ung Cancer (Young Cancer), which provides support to young cancer patients, in lieu of other holiday gift-giving.\\n>Table of Contents|26\\nCreating Better Health for Our Employees and Communities\\nWe could not bring these programs to life without the 257 employees across Canada and the U.S. who serve as Regional Volunteer Chairs across McKesson offices and distribution centers. They organize local events and inspire their colleagues to join our companywide volunteer programs.\\nIn Europe, both our businesses and their employees showed their support for cancer nonprofits. For example, our LloydsApotek business in Sweden surveyed its employees to identify the nonprofits they most wished to support. Their top pick was Ung Cancer (Young Cancer), which provides psychosocial and community support to young cancer patients. For the past three years, LloydsApotek has made annual donations to the organization in lieu of other holiday gift-giving. In Germany, our GEHE business donates to PRIMAKLIMA, a nonprofit that organizes an annual camp to provide support and community for children fighting cancer.\\n Growing the international marrow registry: In the U.S., we continue to partner with the Gift of Life Bone Marrow Registry to grow our McKesson Marrow Drive. Together, we\\'ve added more than 5,200 committed donors to the international registry. Employees register during voluntary biometric screenings, refer friends and family, and organize drives in the community. We also sponsor drives at partner universities. The registry urgently needs donors of diverse backgrounds, and we have partnered closely with McKesson\\'s employee resource groups to help get the donors they need. As of the end of FY19, the drive has led to 26 matches and five transplants. Interest is growing across our company. In late FY19, our GEHE business in Germany started a marrow drive in partnership with DKMS, an international nonprofit. Starting at their headquarters office, it has already expanded to several of GEHE\\'s warehouses.\\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\\n\\nTogether, we\\'ve added more than 5,200 committed donors to the international registry.

In FY19, these were again close to home in the U.S., as many found themselves in the paths of Hurricanes Florence and Michael and in California, our neighbors faced massive and deadly fires.\\nWhen natural disasters appear likely, we act quickly. McKesson contacts customers and first responders to encourage them to order additional inventory. We prepare our facilities for difficult conditions and stock extra medication and supplies, such as vaccines for first responders. We partner with government agencies to help our drivers access roads, so patients can receive the medications they need.\\nIn addition, we support disaster relief through our Taking Care of Our Own Fund, a relief fund that supports our people when the unexpected happens. Since 2013, it has provided cash grants to employees who face hardship after sudden and severe events, including natural disasters and personal hardships. It is supported by donations from McKesson and the McKesson Foundation, as well as from employees.\\nIn FY19, as part of the Taking Care of Our Own Fund, we introduced $1,000 Get You to Safety grants to provide evacuation assistance to employees. The grant money is wired within 24 hours for qualified government-declared disasters. In addition, we expanded the Fund to McKesson Canada. During the fiscal year, these grants supported more than 180 McKesson employees affected by Hurricanes Florence and Michael, as well as California fires, and floods in the Midwest and Quebec.

Honor commitments. Never compromise ethics. Compassion. Walk in the shoes of people we serve and those with whom we work. Relationships. Build trust through collaboration. Innovation. Invent the future and learn from the past. Performance. Demonstrate excellence in everything we do.\\nContents\\n2 Our People 4 Our Partners 8 Environment 9 Awards & Recognition\\nOn the cover: The United Health Foundation and Recipe for Success, an organization committed to combating childhood obesity, have teamed up to change the way children understand and choose what to eat. Helping the community provide healthier diets for kids can promote better food choices in future generations, the effects of which can last a lifetime.\\nUnitedHealth Group | Helping Build Healthier Communities\\nDRIVEN BY OUR MISSION AND SUPPORTED BY OUR CORE VALUES, WE ARE HELPING BUILD HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES.\\n\\nThe people of UnitedHealth Group are driven by our mission to help people live healthier lives and to help make the health system work better for everyone. Our social responsibility and philanthropic efforts are aligned with our mission and values, supporting initiatives that combine our knowledge, experience and compassion -- as an enterprise and as individuals -- to improve health quality and outcomes in the communities where we live and work.\\nOur People and Our Partners\\nOur aspiration for higher-quality care for all and health care systems that serve more people with better care worldwide presents a huge opportunity. Our people demonstrate their conviction to helping build healthier communities by giving generously to charitable causes they care deeply about and volunteering their personal time, skills and energy to serve others. Through the power of collaboration and teamwork with partners who share our concerns and our desire to make life better for others we are making meaningful progress around the world.\\n\\nOur Company\\nUnitedHealth Group serves people through two distinct, complementary businesses:\\n\\nUnitedHealthcare (www.uhc.com) serves nearly 50 million people worldwide by offering medical benefits for individuals and students; employers of all sizes; and Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and retirees.\\n\\nOptum (www.optum.com) is a leading information and technology-enabled health services business that delivers intelligent, integrated solutions that help modernize the health system and improve overall population health.\\n\\nUnitedHealth Group | Helping Build Healthier Communities | 1\\nOur People\\nUnitedHealth Group\\'s year-round giving program supports employees\\' desires and efforts to give back to the communities where they live and work, across the nation and around the world. Through charitable contributions and volunteering, our people are deeply and personally involved in improving the health and welfare of their neighbors.\\n\\nEmployee Giving & Volunteering\\nOur people generously contribute all year long to causes and organizations close to their hearts. The United Health Foundation, a not-for-profit, private foundation established by UnitedHealth Group and dedicated to improving health and health care, matches employee contributions, dollar for dollar, to nearly all nonprofit organizations, doubling the impact. Employees have the ability to give whenever, wherever and however they choose.\\nIn 2018, employee contributions combined with the United Health Foundation match totaled $55 million. Employees contributed to 23,000 charitable causes.\\nIn addition to financial support, our people give their time and talents to help build healthier communities. For example, employees recently provided flu shots for homeless individuals in Chile; filled backpacks with new school supplies and donated them to Flint, Michigan, area students; upgraded school fitness spaces in Los Angeles, Chicago and Hartford; and packed meals to fight hunger throughout the United States.\\n\\nUnitedHealthcare Children\\'s Foundation\\nSince 2007, the UnitedHealthcare Children\\'s Foundation (UHCCF) has offered medical grants that provide financial relief for families who have children with medical needs not covered, or not fully covered, by their commercial health insurance plan. Families do not need to have UnitedHealthcare insurance to be eligible.\\nThrough the generosity of more than 6,500 UnitedHealth Group employees, the United Health Foundation, other individuals and corporations, UHCCF celebrated a record year in 2018, awarding 3,242 medical grants. Over the last 11 years, the organization has awarded more than 18,600 grants valued at $45.1 million, and has impacted the lives of more than 80,000 individuals. The UHCCF is well on target to award its 20,000th medical grant in 2020.\\nTo learn more about the UnitedHealthcare Children\\'s Foundation, visit www.UHCCF.org.\\n\\n2 | UnitedHealth Group | Helping Build Healthier Communities\\nTeam members from across UnitedHealth Group participated in the Walk to End Alzheimer\\'s to show their commitment to helping the millions of people and their families affected by this disease.\\n\\nFEATURE: TEAM MEMBERS UNITE TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES\\n\\nThe people of UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare are committed to serving the communities where they live and work.

More than 1,400 UnitedHealth Group employees took part in walks in 96 cities across the U.S., raising nearly $150,000 for Alzheimer\\'s care, support and research.\\n\\nHelp for Homeless Veterans\\nOptum and UnitedHealthcare team members joined forces to pack veteran care kits, containing hygiene and comfort items, and helped distribute them to homeless veterans through the American Red Cross\\' Service to the Armed Forces program. Teams collected soap, shampoo, conditioner, dental care products and more.\\nWith the outpouring of support from team members, UnitedHealthcare and Optum were able to assemble 500 care kits, double their goal of 250. The kits were distributed in Minnesota during a Stand Down event where supplies and services are provided to homeless veterans.\\nTo read more stories about how our employees support their local communities, visit:\\nwww.unitedhealthgroup.com/socialresponsibility\\n\\nOur People by the Numbers\\n\\nEmployee giving program contributions totaled\\n$55M\\nin 2018\\n\\nCharities supported worldwide through the giving program totaled\\n23,000\\n\\nEmployee volunteer hours donated in 2018 totaled\\n2.5M\\n\\nUnitedHealth Group | Helping Build Healthier Communities | 3\\nOur Partners\\nThe power of partnerships and collaboration is key to building healthier communities. We partner with organizations committed to making health care better through innovation, local insight and perseverance in the face of tremendous challenges. Together, we\\'re discovering new insights into the health of our communities and helping to create the path to a healthier future. These partnerships focus on the following four areas: Connecting Individuals to Quality Care; Creating a 21st Century Health Workforce; Supporting Whole-Person Health; and Serving Distinct Populations.\\n\\nConnecting Individuals to Quality Care\\nCommunity Outreach Targets Oral Cancer in Kentucky\\n\\nKentucky has a growing problem with access to dental care and oral health services. According to the United Health Foundation\\'s 2018 America\\'s Health Rankings, the number of dentists per capita has declined for three straight years.\\n\\nA grant from the United Health Foundation is helping the University of Kentucky College of Dentistry launch a project to \"Eradicate Oral Cancer in Eastern Kentucky.\"\\n\\nKentucky also has one of the nation\\'s highest incidences of oral cancer, according to the National Institutes of Health, and the prevalence of oral cancer in Harlan, Letcher and Pike counties in eastern Kentucky is as much as 54 percent higher than the state average. Oral cancer has a high rate of mortality; only about 57 percent of people survive five years after diagnosis, due in large part to late discovery.\\n\\nA $1 million grant from the United Health Foundation is helping the University of Kentucky College of Dentistry (UKCD) launch its \"Eradicate Oral Cancer in Eastern Kentucky\" project, an integrated outreach and care program delivered to community residents through their local health departments.\\n\\nThe goal of the three-year project is to raise public awareness of the symptoms of oral cancer and its link to heavy alcohol and tobacco use, provide approximately 1,000 oral cancer screenings at local health departments and help connect patients who need additional care to cancer specialists.\\n\\nUKCD will share the findings from the \"Eradicate Oral Cancer in Eastern Kentucky\" project in presentations to state and national organizations, along with guidance on how the program could be replicated or adapted in other communities.\\n\\n4 | UnitedHealth Group | Helping Build Healthier Communities\\nSupporting Whole-Person Health\\n\\nImproving Access to Mental Health Care for Children\\n\\nSuicide among children and teenagers in the U.S. is on the rise.\\n\\nMental health care, especially for children, is lagging behind\\n\\ndemand as clinicians struggle to address whole-person health\\n\\nfor all age groups. According to the United Health Foundation\\'s\\n\\n2018 America\\'s Health Rankings, Kentucky has seen a 25 percent\\n\\nincrease in teen suicides since 2016.

It is the\\n\\nonly agency in the region that employs psychiatrists for children and adolescents.\\n\\nThe United Health Foundation grant enables Pathways to provide better access to specialty mental health care for the 3,000 children it serves. Pathways will install and operate telehealth technology at its 16 outpatient offices and specialty residential units, eliminating the need for families to drive as long as two hours to access a mental health specialist.\\n\\n\"With the United Health Foundation as our partner, we will be able to provide life-changing services for children and families who need specialized mental health care,\" said Dr. Kimberly McClanahan, chief executive officer, Pathways. \"We will also be able to address the shortage of mental health care providers in rural Kentucky through our new telehealth technology.\"\\n\\nServing Distinct Populations\\n\\nInsight into the Health of Military Service Members\\n\\nIn October, the United Health Foundation released the 2018 America\\'s Health Rankings Health of Those Who Have Served Report. This report, created in partnership with the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA), is the only national resource to provide comprehensive population-based insights into the health of those who have served.\\n\\nThe United Health Foundation released the America\\'s Health Rankings Health of Those Who Have Served Report, a check-up on the health of individuals who have served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces.\\n\\nAmong the 2018 report\\'s key findings:  Those who have served are more likely than civilians to report\\nthat their health is very good or excellent.  Men and women who have served have higher rates of\\ndepression, anxiety and frequent mental distress than civilian men and women.\\n\\nThe report also documents some encouraging markers of preventive and primary care where those who have served fare better than their civilian counterparts.  Colorectal Cancer Screening: 72.4 percent vs. 66.0 percent  Dental Visit: 69.6 percent vs. 65.2 percent  Flu Vaccine: 50.6 percent vs. 37.0 percent  Unmet Medical Need Due to Cost: 8.7 percent vs. 14.1 percent\\n\\nIn total, this report features 31 health measures, including 10 new measures focused on mental health and opioid misuse. These new markers of health offer greater data-driven insights into the strengths and challenges associated with the health of these individuals. By providing new insights on opportunities to improve the health of those who have served, this report reflects the United Health Foundation\\'s commitment to supporting the health of military service members, veterans and their families.\\n\\nUnitedHealth Group | Helping Build Healthier Communities | 5\\nCreating a 21st Century Health Workforce\\nEducating the Next Generation of Health Data Experts\\n\\nInvesting in tomorrow\\'s health care data scientists is vital\\n\\nto helping solve some of the health system\\'s toughest\\n\\nchallenges and creating the actionable insights needed\\n\\nto improve care quality and health outcomes.

To address this critical public health issue, the Greater Columbus Infant Mortality Task Force developed recommendations to reduce the community\\'s alarming infant mortality rate by 40 percent and cut the racial health disparity gap in half by 2020. CelebrateOne was created to train and deploy community health workers to help carry out the task force\\'s recommendations. One of these community health workers is Vanitia Turner.\\nVanitia Turner (pictured above, third from left), a mother to six children and grandmother to 16 grandchildren, was inspired to join CelebrateOne because she knew firsthand the painful reality of losing a child too soon. In 2011, Kendalyn Rose Gore, Vanitia\\'s granddaughter, died from sudden infant death syndrome while asleep at home.\\nVanitia is helping reduce infant mortality in Columbus by connecting Columbus area mothers to essential health and social services, including prenatal care and education, easy-to-use cribs, transportation and emergency food and housing. \"I don\\'t think any parent or grandparent should go through the death of a child when it\\'s preventable,\" says Vanitia. \"We want to see babies thrive in their first year and thereafter.\"\\n\\nCelebrateOne is charged with tackling the most significant factors that contribute to Columbus\\' high infant mortality rate:\\n Babies born too soon or too small;  Exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy and\\nsecondhand smoke in the early days of life;  Sleep-related deaths; and  Health inequities that lead to higher infant mortality\\nrates for black children.\\nCelebrateOne and Columbus Public Health set a goal of adding 72 new community health workers to conduct outreach to women of childbearing age in eight Columbus communities. These community health workers are trained to connect mothers and mothers-to-be with resources, programs and services  such as prenatal care and safe sleep practices  to help reduce infant mortality. The initiative was funded by a $1.7 million partnership grant from the United Health Foundation in 2016.\\nAs of November 2018, a total of 87 local residents have completed the community health worker certification program through The Ohio State University College of Nursing, surpassing the initial goal of 72. The community health workers have educated approximately 25,400 Columbus mothers and mothers-to-be.\\nTo read more stories about our partners, visit:\\nwww.unitedhealthgroup.com/socialresponsibility\\n\\nUnitedHealth Group | Helping Build Healthier Communities | 7\\nEnvironment\\n\\nThe environment plays an important role in the health of every community.

We work to meet growing demands for energy and chemical products while advancing other priorities such as economic growth, environmental protection, education, poverty reduction, health, security and human rights.\\nI\\'m proud of the role we play in raising living standards. Millions of people have escaped extreme poverty in the last two decades due in part to increased access to energy.\\nThe energy we produce is important. So is the way we produce it.\\nThe men and women of ExxonMobil are focused on meeting society\\'s dual challenge  meeting energy needs while also minimizing the environmental impacts of energy use, including the risks of climate change. It\\'s one of society\\'s largest and most complex challenges and requires thoughtful engagement at all levels, focusing on practical and affordable solutions that work at the necessary scale.\\nAt ExxonMobil, we work extensively to reduce emissions and other environmental impacts of energy use in our operations and through the products we sell. We\\'re also a leader in researching and developing energy technologies, like algae biofuels and carbon capture, utilization and storage, that could potentially play a role in helping mitigate the risks of climate change.\\nAnother key sustainability focus is health. We directly impact this through our commitment to the safety of our\\n\\nworkers and members of communities where we work. We continue to make good progress toward our goal of Nobody Gets Hurt. In 2017, we had the fewest recordable injuries in our company\\'s history. In the communities where we operate, we routinely dialogue with local officials responsible for emergency response, health, safety and environmental protection. Our commitment to communities extends well beyond health and safety. We work to enhance economic development by hiring and training qualified local workers and making local investments. At ExxonMobil we are committed to creating long-term shareholder value by making a positive contribution to society. I hope you find this report helpful in understanding our approach.

In that time, the company has acted on many of our recommendations and we are encouraged by the progress. This year, the company has transitioned from a corporate citizenship report to a sustainability report, which connotes a greater sense of connectedness to global issues and deeper integration with corporate strategy. During our engagement period in 2017-2018, we had the opportunity to observe increased executive engagement in sustainability. Through meetings with the Chairman and CEO, and other senior business leaders in executive, operational and functional roles, we were able to engage the company on transparency, policy and strategy.\\nThis letter represents our individual and collective views on the quality and progress made in ExxonMobil\\'s sustainability reporting and transparency.

This letter is not an official endorsement of ExxonMobil\\'s sustainability report, the corporation, or its policies and strategies.\\nFor past panel feedback statements, visit: exxonmobil.com/sustainabilityreport\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\nLinking sustainability to corporate strategy\\nClimate change, sustainable development and human rights are among the most pressing challenges facing society. Companies are responding by aligning their core business strategy around global initiatives that seek to address these trends -- the Paris Agreement, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). We recognize ExxonMobil\\'s progress in responding to these international issues and goals. We hope that the company will take further steps to demonstrate how climate change, the SDGs, human rights and other sustainability-related challenges link directly with corporate investments and programs central to its long-term business strategy. We also recommend that the sustainability report include more information on how the company is aligning its long-term business strategy and sustainability strategy, along with the risks and opportunities created by these issues.\\nCommunicating the urgency of climate change\\nWe commend ExxonMobil for the significant steps the company has taken over the past year to address climate change. Publication of the Energy and Carbon Summary in early 2018 is a crucial step demonstrating the company\\'s progress in managing climate risk and responding to shareholder concerns. Continued investment in emerging energy technology research as well as dedicated efforts to reduce methane emissions are other areas of notable progress, alongside the company\\'s decision to participate in collective action platforms such as the Climate Leadership Council and global Methane Guiding Principles, and its public support for the Paris Agreement. The company\\'s recent announcement of efforts to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions from flaring and methane emissions through quantified reductions\\n\\nof 25 percent and 15 percent respectively, by 2020, is a significant step forward.\\nDue to the possible negative impacts climate change poses to business operations, human rights and economic development around the world, we urge further integration of climate change into the core of ExxonMobil\\'s business strategy. This includes through continued operational upgrades and nearand long-term research and product development programs.\\nPerhaps most important, we encourage ExxonMobil to lead by example and be bold in its interaction with governments, industry, academic institutions and civil society organizations in the development of public policies that reduce the threat of climate change.\\nMeasuring performance and impact\\nDisclosure of future targets in addition to current performance data is becoming standard practice in corporate sustainability reporting. There is a growing movement where companies are publicly articulating \"science-based targets\" that align with current climate science. ExxonMobil\\'s report thoroughly discloses current and past performance data. As mentioned, we value the recent announcement of forward-looking greenhouse gas reduction measures and would suggest a similar approach for other material issues. Disclosure of the company\\'s most material and salient internal goals provides opportunity for external stakeholders to independently assess the company\\'s strategy and future performance.\\nStronger statements can also be added on the outcomes or impacts arising from the company\\'s programs. Corporate investments and other performance data should be coupled directly with tangible impacts and outcomes that demonstrate ExxonMobil\\'s impact on society. For example, the report discusses the amount of capital invested in developing energy\\n\\n6\\nsolutions with lower emissions. Emphasis could be added on the actual or potential impact of these investments for society. Describing a specific successful technology that resulted, or could result, from this investment could be more compelling than disclosing financial investment data alone. Incorporating these outcomes creates a more engaging report that demonstrates the types of impacts the company is creating for the environment, people and industry.\\nWith respect to human rights, we recommend that the company be bold in stating its objective of no harm. Through many rigorous due diligence processes, ExxonMobil\\'s approach to human rights, for example, closely aligns with the UNGPs. Greater specificity about practices and performance in this area would help the company align its reporting more effectively with societal and industry expectations of best practices. Measuring the impact on human rights quantitatively is difficult. Nevertheless, the company is already assessing impacts on staff and on communities in its areas of operation. We encourage it to expand efforts through further identification of potential adverse impacts, explaining processes used to identify these, and describing steps taken to mitigate them.\\nEngaging strategically with stakeholders\\nCompanies like ExxonMobil have to understand and balance the needs of numerous individual and institutional stakeholders across different value chains and a wide range of cultures, regulations and operating environments. Some relationships are indirect and simple, while others are very complex. ExxonMobil\\'s current disclosure around stakeholder engagement is not sufficiently specific, which can create the perception that the company is not fully disclosing engagement activities. We recommend that ExxonMobil describe its stakeholders and their priorities more explicitly, and how the\\n\\ncompany has addressed their concerns. We also recommend that ExxonMobil describe limitations encountered with stakeholder interactions in countries where open consultation is difficult.\\nWe appreciate that the company publishes a list of its political contributions and philanthropic giving to non-lobbying and nonprofit organizations. In the future, we would like to see more about the relationship between its contributions and its specific sustainability goals and/or programs.\\nConcluding remarks\\nWe recognize the progress that ExxonMobil has made over the past year in publicly addressing complex sustainability issues and call on the company to drive this agenda forward, both through business activities and value chains, as well as through strategic partnerships with others. We encourage the company and its executives to be even more bold and transparent in all aspects of sustainability performance. ExxonMobil is a global leader that others follow in many areas of the energy industry. We believe that taking an increasingly ambitious, evidencebased and technologically innovative position on sustainability issues will provide the company with the opportunity to champion more substantial sustainability efforts worldwide, and to enhance long-term shareholder value.\\nSincerely,\\nCraig Benson, Mark Cohen, Frank Loy, Jane Nelson, Salil Tripathi\\nJune 2018\\n\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\nExternal Sustainability Advisory Panel statement\\nExternal Sustainability Advisory Panel\\nExxonMobil\\'s External Sustainability Advisory Panel is composed of academics, nongovernmental organization representatives and former government employees who have expertise in a variety of environmental, social and governance topics.

While ExxonMobil contributes to certain aspects of all 17 SDGs, the following eight represent those most relevant to ExxonMobil\\'s sustainability focus areas.\\nLearn more about how ExxonMobil contributes to the UN SDGs at exxonmobil.com/sustainabilityreport.\\nSDG Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere United Nations data shows a strong correlation between energy use and improved standards of living. ExxonMobil is working to help lift people out of poverty around the world by expanding access to affordable and versatile energy supplies. In addition, ExxonMobil collaborates with host governments and other local stakeholders to implement community investments that improve health and education, and help build and sustain local economic growth.\\nSDG Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages ExxonMobil supports the health, safety and well-being of our employees while also making investments to support community health systems and programs. For example,\\n\\nsince 2001, we have funded antimalarial programs that have reached more than 125 million people. Another example is our U.S.-based Culture of Health program that provides health education, nutrition and fitness programs that support the well-being of our employees. We are expanding the program to other countries as well.\\nSDG Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all\\nWe invest in education and teacher development programs, placing a specific emphasis on encouraging students to pursue careers in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields. Since 2000, we have contributed more than $1.25 billion to education programs around the world.\\nSDG Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\\nSince 2005, ExxonMobil has invested $111 million in programs that develop female entrepreneurs and business leaders and improve women\\'s ability to advance. Internally, ExxonMobil promotes leadership development for women during all aspects of their careers, including through training and mentoring.\\nSDG Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all\\nExxonMobil delivers reliable and affordable energy that helps fuel economic activity and improve standards of living. Natural gas, for example, supplies 22 percent of the world\\'s energy and has a lower carbon footprint than other traditional energy sources. In addition, ExxonMobil is researching loweremission technologies, such as algae biofuels and advanced carbon capture. We have invested more than $9 billion since 2000 on lower-emission energy solutions.\\n\\nSDG Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all\\nWhen working in a community, we add economic and social value by creating local jobs, supporting local supplier development and providing opportunities through training and investments. We employ nearly 70,000 people around the world.\\nSDG Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns\\nExxonMobil is working to make our operations more efficient while also helping our customers to reduce their emissions. These solutions include creating advanced plastics and other materials that can be used in a range of consumer products to reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency, and by developing premium, high-efficiency fuels and lubricants.\\nSDG Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\\nMeeting the world\\'s growing energy demand while simultaneously reducing environmental impacts, including the risks of climate change, is one of society\\'s most pressing challenges. We are focused on mitigating emissions in our operations, developing technology solutions, providing solutions that reduce emissions for our customers and engaging on climate change policy. We are a founding member of the Climate Leadership Council, which advocates for a revenue-neutral carbon tax and aligns closely with our long-standing principles. In 2018, we joined the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, a voluntary initiative representing 13 of the world\\'s largest oil and gas producers working towards solutions to mitigate the risks of climate change.\\n\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\n8\\nCorporate governance\\n\\nExxonMobil has a long-standing commitment to high ethical standards. Good corporate governance creates a business environment conducive to long-term growth. All our directors are required to stand for election each year at our annual meeting of shareholders. Independent directors also chair key board committees -- audit, compensation, board affairs and public issues and contributions -- that consist entirely of independent directors.\\n\\nAbove: The ExxonMobil board of directors.

Bottom row from the left: Steven Reinemund, Susan Avery and William Weldon.\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\n\"ExxonMobil\\'s board of directors provides a key oversight role, including review of risk management efforts and long-term strategic plans. Ensuring that we have diversity of background, experiences and thought represented on the board remains critical to succeeding in a global market.\"\\nNeil A. Hansen\\nVice president, investor relations and corporate secretary, Exxon Mobil Corporation\\n9\\nBoard leadership\\nExxonMobil\\'s board affairs committee, supported by an independent executive search firm, looks for highly qualified, non-employee candidates with demonstrated leadership, competency and a commitment to represent the interests of all shareholders. To help keep the process collaborative and inclusive, the board affairs committee considers recommendations from shareholders, directors and others on director candidates. At year-end 2017, 40 percent of the board\\'s independent directors were female and/or an ethnic minority.\\nSustainability topics are routinely reviewed at board meetings and typically fall under the purview of the public issues and contributions committee, the board affairs committee and the compensation committee. While risk oversight is the responsibility of the entire board, committees help the board focus on risk aspects relevant to each committee. For example, the public issues and contributions committee is charged with reviewing the effectiveness of the company\\'s policies, programs and practices with respect to the environment, among other duties. The committee hears reports from operating units on environmental activities and also visits operating sites to observe and comment on current practices. The entire board receives briefings by internal experts on environmental stewardship and climate change.\\n\\nCorporate governance\\nboard decided to further enhance the company\\'s disclosures consistent with the proposal and issued these disclosures in February 2018 in ExxonMobil\\'s Energy and Carbon Summary and the Outlook for Energy. These enhancements include energy demand sensitivities, implications of 2 degree Celsius scenarios and positioning for a lower-carbon future.\\nBusiness conduct\\nOperating ethically and responsibly is ingrained in our business culture and is monitored, enforced and improved through our globally deployed Standards of Business Conduct. In 2017, nearly 18,000 employees and contractors participated in anti-corruption training.\\nExxonMobil encourages employees and contractors to ask questions, voice concerns and report any suspected violations of company policies. In addition to our open-door communication procedures, ExxonMobil has several confidential mechanisms for reporting, including a 24-hour \"hotline\" phone number and a mailing address.\\n\\nShareholder relations\\nExxonMobil values the dialogue we have with our shareholders -- and the insight provided -- throughout the year. The board has established procedures for shareholders and other interested parties to communicate with board members. In 2017, we held 68 shareholder engagements on environmental, social and governance issues with institutional investors, pension funds, labor, religious and nongovernmental organizations, representing an estimated 50 percent of outstanding stock held by institutional investors and about 30 percent of total shares outstanding. These engagements have frequently enabled us to reach common ground with our shareholders, in some cases avoiding the need for more formal shareholder proposals at the annual shareholders meeting.\\nConsistent with ExxonMobil\\'s Corporate Governance Guidelines, the board of directors reconsidered a proposal requesting a report on impacts of climate change policies (Item 12) submitted by the New York State Common Retirement Fund, which received a majority of votes cast during the 2017 annual shareholders meeting. In reconsidering the proposal, the company sought input from a number of parties, such as the proponents and major shareholders.

The health and safety policies set by ExxonMobil and adopted by our affiliates reflect our company\\'s commitment to high operational standards and the well-being of our employees. We strive for an incident-free workplace and a culture that complies with our clear and simple objective: Nobody Gets Hurt. We build our culture of safety and health by attracting, developing and retaining individuals who share our commitment to operational excellence.\\n\"In 2017 ExxonMobil achieved our lowest ever recordable injury rate as we continue working to eliminate all serious injuries. These improvements are supported by enhanced safety standards, strengthened safety leadership skills and human performance improvement programs. All of which are worked under our Operational Integrity Management System framework.\"\\nJerry Wascom\\nVice president, operational excellence, safety, security, health and environment, Exxon Mobil Corporation\\n12\\nSafety and health\\nExxonMobil\\'s commitment to operational excellence starts at the top, is driven throughout our businesses and is consistent everywhere we operate. Our global health and safety goal is zero injuries and illnesses.\\nSince 2000, we have reduced our workforce lost-time incident rate by more than 80 percent. While this number is declining, safety incidents do occur. We deeply regret that two contract workers were fatally injured in separate incidents related to ExxonMobil operations in 2017. One incident occurred at an onshore drilling site and the other happened at a refinery during construction activities. We thoroughly investigated the causes and contributing factors associated with the incidents to prevent similar events in the future and to globally disseminate findings.\\nExxonMobil\\'s Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS) establishes a framework for addressing risk across all aspects of our operations. OIMS, which is built around 11 key elements of risk, is embedded into everyday work processes in each of the following areas of safety at ExxonMobil:\\nProcess safety: Process safety is about managing the integrity of our facilities by applying good design principles, engineering and operating practices. ExxonMobil incorporates rigorous safety standards and procedures in our facilities\\' design, construction and operating activities. We classify and track incidents by severity from Tier 1 through Tier 4, with Tier 1 referring to events of greater consequence. In 2017, we experienced 63 Tier 1 process safety events, which is approximately 1.6 percent lower than 2016.\\nProduct stewardship: Product stewardship refers to a series of interconnected work processes for the safe and effective management of a product, focusing on the health, safety and environmental impacts at each phase of a product\\'s lifecycle. We regularly use lifecycle assessments to consider impacts during the development, manufacturing, use and disposal of our products.\\nProduct transportation: ExxonMobil implements rigorous safety and environmental standards while transporting our products, including by marine, pipeline and rail. We carefully maintain and monitor our infrastructure worldwide to identify and prevent corrosion, third-party damage or illegal intrusions onto our rights of way.\\nEmergency preparedness and response: We establish emergency support groups and incident management teams around the world to develop and practice emergency response\\n\\nSafety, health and the workplace\\nstrategies. In 2017, we conducted 37 drills, including in Guyana where we have discovered an estimated recoverable resource of over four billion oil equivalent barrels.\\nOIMS also establishes a framework for addressing risk across our supply chain. Contractors are an integral part of the ExxonMobil team; it is essential that they conduct work in accordance with our policies and business objectives. Since 2000, we have conducted safety leadership forums with contractors working on our major projects. This promotes a strong safety partnership with contract workers to improve our safety performance and positively influence the industry.\\nThe success of ExxonMobil\\'s operations depends on a healthy and competent workforce. We have corporate-wide expectations for identifying, evaluating and managing health risks related to our operations that can potentially affect our employees, contractors or the public.\\nIn each country, we develop workplace health programs that take into consideration local health care systems, health needs and available resources.

We expect our greenhouse gas reduction measures to lead to a 15 percent decrease in methane emissions and a 25 percent reduction in flaring by 2020. We also expect to further improve our industry-leading efficiency in refining and chemical manufacturing facilities.\\nIn 2017, ExxonMobil and our subsidiary XTO Energy established a methane management program that exceeds applicable regulations. The program prioritizes actions at the highestvolume production and midstream sites and includes efforts to develop and deploy new, more efficient technologies to detect and reduce facility emissions.\\nAlong with several industry peers, we issued Guiding Principles, which provide a framework for continually reducing methane emissions, improving accuracy of methane emissions data and advocating sound policies and regulations.\\nOther ways we are reducing emissions include deploying proven technologies such as cogeneration and carbon capture and storage. Longer term, we are conducting and supporting research to further develop breakthrough technologies. For information on how ExxonMobil manages the business risks of climate change, including energy demand sensitivities, implications of 2 degree Celsius scenarios and positioning for a lower-carbon future, please see ExxonMobil\\'s Energy and Carbon Summary.\\nDeveloping technology solutions\\nTechnological advancements will be instrumental to meet rising global energy demand while also lowering greenhouse gas emissions. We are conducting scientific research to enhance existing and develop next-generation energy sources. ExxonMobil has spent more than $9 billion on lower-emission energy solutions since 2000.\\nAt the center of our research is ExxonMobil\\'s Corporate Strategic Research laboratory, a fundamental research institution with approximately 170 PhD scientists and engineers focused on addressing the company\\'s long-range science needs. We support a diverse portfolio of in-house research projects, including next-generation biofuels, carbon capture and storage, alternative energy and climate science. ExxonMobil is partnering with approximately 80 universities around the world to explore new energy technologies.\\n\\nManaging the risks of climate change\\n\\nGreenhouse gas emissions avoided from ExxonMobil actions*\\nNet equity, CO2-equivalent emissions Millions of metric tons\\n\\n160 140 120 100\\n80 60 40 20\\n0 2008\\n\\n2009\\n\\n2010\\n\\n2011\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\nActual\\n\\nAvoided\\n\\n*In 2017, greenhouse gas emissions avoided from ExxonMobil actions were 23.4 million metric tons. Since 2008, we have avoided 168 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions as a result of ExxonMobil actions. Our calculations are based on the guidance provided in American Petroleum Institute\\'s Compendium of Greenhouse Gas Emission Estimation Methodologies for the Oil and Gas Industry and IPIECA\\'s Petroleum Industry Guidelines for Reporting Greenhouse Gas Emissions. We report greenhouse gas emissions on a net equity basis for our business operations, demonstrating a share of emissions from any facility or operation in which ExxonMobil holds a financial interest, with the share reflecting the equity interest.\\n\\nIn carbon capture, we are conducting research to find ways to improve existing technologies. One project, with FuelCell Energy, is focused on reducing the cost of capturing carbon by using carbonate fuel cells that generate power while capturing carbon. We are identifying potential locations for pilot testing.\\nExxonMobil has extensive experience in carbon capture and has a working interest in more than one-fifth of the world\\'s total carbon capture and storage capacity. In 2017, we captured approximately 6.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide for storage.\\n\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\n17\\nWe are also conducting extensive research on biofuels. In 2017, ExxonMobil and Synthetic Genomics, Inc. announced breakthrough research involving a modified algae strain that more than doubled its oil content without significantly inhibiting growth, a key challenge along the path to commercial scalability. We recently announced a new research phase of this project that could lead to the production of 10,000 barrels of algae biofuel per day by 2025. The new phase of research includes an outdoor field study that will grow naturally occurring algae in several ponds in California.\\nEmissions reduction\\n> $9B\\ninvested to develop loweremission energy solutions\\nsince 2000\\n\\n> $4 Billion\\ninvested since 2000 at our Upstream facilities around the world on emission reduction efforts, including energy efficiency and flare mitigation\\n\\n> $2 Billion\\ninvested since 2000 in our refining and chemical facilities and enabling research around the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions\\n\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\n> $3 Billion\\nin support of Upstream, Downstream and Chemical cogeneration facilities since 2001 to more efficiently produce electricity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions\\n\\nManaging the risks of climate change\\nProviding solutions for customers\\nIn addition to developing and deploying technologies to reduce emissions from our own operations, we are working to help our customers reduce their emissions. Our goal is to develop solutions that are economically competitive and affordable, including:\\nExpanding the supply of cleaner-burning natural gas to reduce emissions in power generation: The use of natural gas in power generation represents one of the greatest opportunities for society to reduce emissions and transition to a lower greenhouse gasintensive energy system. ExxonMobil is one of the largest natural gas producers in the world and is a leader in liquefied natural gas technology.\\nCreating lightweight plastics and other materials for a range of consumer products: ExxonMobil\\'s next-generation plastic packaging reduces total product weight and enables more products per shipment, fewer trucks on the road, less fuel and energy used, fewer greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately less material to be reused, recovered or recycled. For example, for every 10 percent drop in vehicle weight, fuel economy improves by an estimated 7 percent. We recognize plastic waste is an issue for societies, and ExxonMobil is engaged with diverse industries in helping to identify solutions.\\nDeveloping premium, high-efficiency fuels and lubricants: Our family of high-performance lubricants includes synthetic lubricants like Mobil 1TM Annual Protection that need to be replaced less frequently than conventional motor oils, therefore reducing the volume of used oil for disposal or recycling. Our lubricants and greases are also used in more than 40,000 wind turbines worldwide.\\nEngaging on climate change policy\\nClimate change is a global issue that requires the collaboration of governments, companies, consumers and other stakeholders. We engage a variety of stakeholders on climate change issues -- including policymakers, investors, consumers, nongovernmental organizations, academics and the public -- to advocate for responsible policies that would be effective in addressing the risks of climate change.\\nExxonMobil supports the Paris Agreement as an important framework for addressing the risks of climate change. We welcomed the Paris Agreement when it was announced in December 2015, and again when it came into effect in November 2016. We have reiterated our support to government officials, nongovernmental organizations and the broader public.\\n18\\nManaging the risks of climate change\\n\\nFree markets, innovation and technology are essential in addressing the risks of climate change. Success in developing and deploying technologies will be highly dependent on governments creating a policy environment that enables innovation and competition. Policies should be clear and guard against duplicative, overlapping and conflicting regulations, which may distort markets and impose unnecessary costs on consumers. We believe an effective policy response to climate change requires a thorough understanding of the climate system. Our scientists have been involved in climate change research and related policy analysis for more than 35 years, resulting in hundreds of publicly available documents on climate-related topics, including more than 50 peer-reviewed publications.\\nWe believe that effective policies are those that:\\n Promote global participation;  Let market prices drive the selection of solutions;  Ensure a uniform and predictable cost of greenhouse gas emissions across the economy;  Minimize complexity and administrative costs;  Maximize transparency; and  Provide flexibility to react to developments in technology, climate science and policy.\\nExxonMobil is a founding member of the Climate Leadership Council. The Council was created by former U.S. Secretaries of State George P. Shultz and James A. Baker, III to advocate for a carbon tax that would implement a gradually increasing price on carbon. The revenues generated by the plan would be returned to American energy consumers. In 2018, we joined the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, a voluntary initiative representing 13 of the world\\'s largest oil and gas producers working collaboratively toward solutions to mitigate the risks of climate change.\\n\\nClimate risk oversight\\nExxonMobil\\'s board of directors is responsible for risk oversight, including the risks of climate change. The board routinely reviews and considers these risks, including briefings on public policy, scientific and technical research, as well as company and external positions and actions in this area. Climate-related matters are also considered by the board throughout the year in various other contexts, including reviews of the Outlook for Energy, the company\\'s safety, health and environmental performance, the annual corporate planning process, shareholder proposals and regulatory filings such as the 10-K.\\nSynthetic Genomics, Inc. and ExxonMobil are working together to turn algae into a low-emission transportation fuel.\\n\\nExplore more\\n2018 ExxonMobil Energy and Carbon Summary exxonmobil.com/ecsummary\\n\\nPartnering with Singapore universities to innovate lower-emission technologies\\nexxonmobil.com/singaporeuniversities\\n\\nTaking action to manage methane emissions\\nexxonmobil.com/ managemethaneemissions\\n\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\n19\\nEnvironmental performance\\nAbove: ExxonMobil is working to help protect the Scheepmaker\\'s Crowned Pigeon, a threatened species native to Papua New Guinea. 2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\nOur diverse portfolio of projects requires us to work in remote and sensitive environments including Arctic, deepwater and biodiverse locations.

To protect particular species and sensitive habitats, we take steps such as modifying engineering design and enhancing wildlife habitats at our properties.\\nWater management\\nOur net freshwater consumption at our operations was 300 million cubic meters in 2017. This represents about a 20 percent decline since 2011, in part due to the development and implementation of local water management strategies.\\nIn our Upstream onshore operations, water consumption is primarily associated with hydraulic fracturing, which uses water pressure to create small cracks or fissures in rocks deep underground so that oil or natural gas can flow to the well. The industry has more than 60 years of experience with the technique.\\nWe continuously work to improve our understanding of our water consumption, including when, where and how much. Using the latest version of a water tool developed by IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry association for environmental and social issues, we identified that almost 37 percent of our major operating sites are in areas with the potential for water scarcity. Therefore, we pursue site-specific management strategies such as the deployment of water conservation technologies, the use of alternative water sources, recycling of municipal and industrial wastewater, substitution with lower-quality water sources and harvesting of rainwater.\\n\\nEnvironmental management process\\n\\nEnvironmental performance\\n\\nIdentify\\nEnvironmental and social aspects\\n\\n+ Evaluate\\nEnvironmental, social and regulatory settings\\n\\nConduct\\nEnvironmental and social risk assessment\\n\\nApply\\nEnvironmental and social aspects\\n\\nMonitor & Evaluate\\n\\nManage risks Avoid, reduce, remedy\\n\\nSpill performance and prevention\\nExxonMobil is committed to the prevention and elimination of spills from our operations. We have the industry\\'s only dedicated, in-house oil spill response research program. If a spill does occur, we ensure a rapid, comprehensive response to minimize impact on communities and the environment.\\nWe reported our best-ever performance for number of spills in 2017. We had 7 percent fewer than 2016. Since 2011, ExxonMobil has reduced the absolute number of spills greater than 1 barrel by more than 55 percent across our global operations. The total volume of hydrocarbons spilled on soil and water was 6,900 barrels in 2017, and more than 65 percent was recovered at the spill sites. The majority of these spills did not affect third parties or nearby communities.\\nAir emissions\\nExxonMobil is committed to doing our part to contribute to cleaner air in the communities where we operate. Our combined emissions of volatile organic compounds, sulfur dioxide\\n\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\n21\\nand nitrogen oxides have decreased by almost 31 percent over the past 10 years across all our businesses. New air measurement technologies are making it easier to monitor ambient air at our Downstream facilities in the United States and Canada. Data collected around the perimeter of our facilities is publicly available to local communities.\\nDecommissioning and rehabilitation\\nWe are committed to sustainably managing our surplus properties. In 2017, ExxonMobil Environmental Services monitored about 4,000 active remediation sites in more than 30 countries.\\nA significant number of our Upstream locations are located offshore. To effectively manage offshore operations, we use a systematic decommissioning process that varies depending on the type of structure and unique characteristics of a specific site. ExxonMobil created an offshore decommissioning center of expertise in 2015 that is responsible for planning and managing the safe decommissioning of our assets.\\nSeismicity\\nExxonMobil has a comprehensive risk management approach in place to limit induced seismicity from our operations by evaluating the relative risks associated with the specific geological and geographic context of a site.\\nWe work with academic and government researchers and regulatory agencies to share our knowledge and advanced approaches. For example, ExxonMobil and Stanford University jointly developed a software modeling tool to assess the potential risk of induced seismicity and made it freely available to government and industry. The tool is being used by regulatory agencies and energy companies to help reduce the risk of human-induced seismicity.\\n\\nEnvironmental performance\\nKaren Power, a production engineer, in front of ExxonMobil\\'s Hebron offshore platform off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.\\n\\nExplore more\\nProtecting the endangered western gray whale exxonmobil.com/westerngraywhale\\n\\nReducing nitrate flow to the Mississippi River\\nexxonmobil.com/nitrateflowmississippi\\n\\nDecommissioning the Sable offshore energy project\\nexxonmobil.com/sableoffshoreenergyproject\\n\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\n22\\nCommunity engagement and human rights\\n\\nExxonMobil works in communities all over the world, each with its own unique cultures, needs and sensitivities. Identifying and mitigating potential negative social impacts is integral to developing long-term, positive relationships with these communities. At ExxonMobil, we aim to promote and respect human rights in all areas where we work.\\n\\nAbove: In 2017, ExxonMobil partnered with the Youth Empowerment and Development Initiative to organize community events to raise awareness about malaria in Lagos, Nigeria as part of World Malaria Day.\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\n\"In Angola, our key initiatives in women\\'s empowerment and malaria support the priorities of the government and local communities. Through strategic partnerships, a shared responsibility to sustainability and an aligned vision, we have a positive impact on communities where we operate.\"\\nFernando Pegado\\nPublic and government affairs manager, ExxonMobil Angola\\n23\\nCommunity relations\\nUnderstanding and addressing the interests of communities where we operate is critical to maintaining a sustainable business. We engage with local communities through a variety of communication channels -- including open houses, community discussions and individual meetings -- to provide opportunities for dialogue with interested stakeholders. ExxonMobil creates grievance reporting mechanisms that provide opportunities for local citizens and communities to raise concerns.\\nRespecting human rights\\nWe believe our business presence can and should have a positive influence on the people in the communities in which we operate. ExxonMobil is committed to respecting human rights as a fundamental principle in our operations, implemented through training and the application of our internal policies and practices. The company\\'s practices and operations reflect the spirit and intent of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\\nIn 2017, ExxonMobil\\'s supplier, vendor and contractor expectations became part of an annual letter we send to our suppliers. These expectations include references to key international human rights frameworks such as the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the International Labor Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.\\nWe participate in the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, an initiative that provides guidance to extractive companies on human rights risk assessments relating to the safeguarding of company operations or facilities. Engaging and training host government and private security on the Voluntary Principles is key to reducing human rights risks in certain communities. In 2017, more than 5,000 host government security and ExxonMobil-contracted security personnel were trained on the Voluntary Principles across 12 higher-risk countries.\\n\\nCommunity engagement and human rights\\nInvesting in our communities\\nExxonMobil collaborates with governments and other stakeholders to invest in community development programs where we operate. We work with local stakeholders to ensure that our efforts are tailored to address community and business needs, such as access to skills training and health care, support for disaster relief, education initiatives and economic development. In 2017, we contributed $204 million to communities around the world.\\nThe ExxonMobil Foundation collaborated with Mercy Corps, Technoserve and the Center for Global Development to measure the effect of mobile banking in empowering women economically.\\n\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\n24\\n2017 community investments\\nExxonMobil provides investments to benefit many communities around the world.\\nBy focus area*\\n\\nBy geographic region*\\n\\nCommunity engagement and human rights\\n\\n$204M\\nWorldwide total\\n\\n$62M Civic and community $43M Employee and retiree giving $42M Higher education $17M Health and environment $15M Pre-college education $8M Women $6M Public policy research $5M United appeals and workplace giving $3M Other education $3M Arts and culture\\n\\n*Total contributions include donations from Exxon Mobil Corporation, our divisions and affiliates, and the ExxonMobil Foundation, as well as employee and retiree giving through ExxonMobil\\'s matching gift, disaster relief and employee giving programs.

Helping establish ExxonMobil as a responsible partner and supporting capacity building of Guyanese suppliers for decades to come are important priorities as we continue our work.\"\\nRod Henson\\nLead country manager, Exxon Mobil Guyana\\n26\\nLocal development\\nA successful local development program requires a long-term perspective with clearly defined and consistently applied management processes. Our approach focuses on three key areas: employing and training a local workforce, supporting local suppliers and improving livelihoods of community members through local community investments.\\nWe provide locally hired individuals with opportunities to develop technical and leadership skills that will benefit them throughout their careers with ExxonMobil, and with future employers. With about 60 percent of our employees located outside the United States, local hiring ensures that our workforce remains culturally diverse and representative of the countries where we operate. As illustrated to the right, we continued to make progress in local hiring and training in 2017.\\nSupply chain management\\nWe work to source goods from local suppliers. In 2017, ExxonMobil made payments to more than 100,000 suppliers of goods and services worldwide.\\nWe have developed a set of best practices to help ensure our company consistently engages with local and diverse suppliers. These practices include supplier forums, local supplier databases and local enterprise centers for business development and training. For example, we have established a Centre for Local Business Development and supplier registration portal to support identification and training of Guyanese suppliers for our new development in Guyana. A similar example, in Papua New Guinea, has supported nearly 19,000 local entrepreneurs.\\nIn addition, we cultivate long-lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with diverse suppliers to contribute to the economic development of historically underrepresented groups. In 2017, we exceeded our target with a total of $1.9 billion in spending with diverse suppliers in the United States.\\nOur supplier diversity program continues to expand internationally. In 2017, we spent $186 million with women-owned and indigenous-owned businesses outside the United States. We continue to work with the nonprofit WEConnect International, a global network that connects women-owned businesses to qualified buyers, to increase the participation of women-owned businesses in our supply chain. In addition to compiling an international database of women-owned businesses used by ExxonMobil, WEConnect identifies, educates\\n\\nLocal development and supply chain management\\n\\n2017 local hiring statistics\\n\\nPersonnel locally hired\\n\\nPersonnel locally hired in supervisory or managerial positions\\n\\nAngola Chad* Equatorial Guinea Indonesia Nigeria\\n\\n86%\\n6% since 2013\\n95%\\n1% since 2014\\n76%\\n6% since 2013\\n95%\\n5% since 2013\\n95%\\n4% since 2013\\n\\n64%\\n50% since 2013\\n87%\\n25% since 2014\\n39%\\n26% since 2013\\n89%\\n14% since 2013\\n90%\\n69% since 2013\\n\\n*Historic data since 2013 is not available for Chad.

The storm caused an estimated $125 billion in damages, and rebuilding efforts continue. ExxonMobil acted swiftly to ensure the safety of our employees and support affected communities.\\n\\nSupporting our communities and our people\\nWe started our response to Hurricane Harvey before it even arrived -- by making a financial contribution to community disaster relief efforts and by beginning to safely shut down our operations and make plans to bring in fuel from unaffected locations to aid in response and recovery.\\nAt our Baytown and Beaumont refineries, we worked to minimize environmental impacts from our operations that were caused by the storm and resulting power loss, and reported impacts to appropriate authorities.\\nWe helped our employees -- many of whom spent day and night on the job to help safely shut down and then quickly restart our operations -- clean up and repair their own homes, when they were flooded by the storm.\\nIn the days and weeks following the storm, ExxonMobil contributed more than $7 million to assist with recovery efforts, and provided supplies and volunteers to assist with community recovery.\\nFor example, our employees helped the city of Beaumont restore its municipal water system, when Harvey left more than 100,000 people without running water. And we transported more\\n\\nthan 60,000 pounds of cargo via helicopter to stranded personnel and community members throughout the area. As rebuilding along the Gulf Coast continues, we are thankful for the incredible dedication of our employees and the resilience of our neighbors and the communities we serve.\\nEmergency response operations\\nThe ability to respond promptly during a disaster -- regardless of where it strikes -- is critical. ExxonMobil conducts extensive training and drills to prepare for such situations. We design our facilities to withstand a variety of extreme conditions. Regardless of the size, severity or cause of an event, each ExxonMobil facility and business unit has access to trained responders and resources. We practice emergency response strategies and routinely test our emergency response teams in accordance with regulatory requirements and our own Operations Integrity Management System.\\nAbove: Relief supplies for Hurricane Harvey victims being loaded into a helicopter by ExxonMobil employees in Texas.\\n\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\n29\\nAbout the Sustainability Report Highlights\\nThe Highlights summarize ExxonMobil\\'s approach to managing our operations, and explains the measures we employ to operate in a variety of environments.

on performance table:\\n1 Workforce includes employees and contractors. Accidents or incidents include both injuries and illnesses. From 2008 through 2017 all fatalities were injury-related.\\n2 Incidents include injuries and illnesses. Safety data are based on information at the time of publication. Workforce includes employees and contractors.\\n3 Reduction from 2011 primarily due to divestment and restructuring activity in the Downstream business.\\n4 Regular employees are defined as active executive, management, professional, technical and wage employees who work full-time or part-time for ExxonMobil and are covered by ExxonMobil\\'s benefit plans and programs. Employees at our company-operated retail stores are not included.\\n5 The net equity greenhouse gas emissions metric was introduced in 2011 as a replacement for the direct equity greenhouse gas metric. Information has been restated back to 2005 according to the new metric. The net equity greenhouse gas metric includes direct and imported greenhouse gas emissions and excludes emissions from exports (including Hong Kong Power through mid-2014). ExxonMobil reports greenhouse gas emissions on a net equity basis for all our business operations, reflecting our percent ownership in an asset.\\n6 The addition of direct emissions and emissions associated with exported power and heat is equivalent to World Resources Institute (WRI) Scope 1.\\n7 These emissions are equivalent to WRI Scope 2.\\n\\n8 Cumulative figure.\\n9 The value for hazardous waste from ongoing operations includes produced water classified as hazardous waste by one local authority, which is approximately 70 to 95 percent of the reported figure in 2008-2012.\\n10 Total contributions include ExxonMobil corporate and foundation donations, and employee and retiree giving through ExxonMobil\\'s matching gift, disaster relief and employee giving programs.\\n11 Beginning in 2015, our spending encompassed an expanded set of diverse classifications that includes: minorityowned businesses, women-owned businesses, small business-owned, lesbian-, gay-, bisexual- and transgender-owned businesses, veteran-owned businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses and businesses owned by peoples with disabilities. Prior to 2014, spending included minority- and women-owned businesses.\\n12 In countries where ExxonMobil has an Upstream business presence.\\n* Some uncertainty exists in performance data, depending on measurement methods. Data in the report and performance data table represent best available information at the time of publication. Performance data are reported for our affiliates and those operations under direct ExxonMobil management and operational control. Includes XTO Energy performance beginning in 2011. N/A is used to indicate that data are not available.\\n\\n2017 Sustainability Report Highlights\\n\\n34\\nExplore our complete 2017 Sustainability Report at exxonmobil.com/sustainabilityreport\\nOn the cover ExxonMobil scientist Kelsey McNeely researching algae strains.\\nExxon Mobil Corporation Corporate Headquarters 5959 Las Colinas Blvd. Irving, Texas 75039-2298 exxonmobil.com\\n\\n',\n",
