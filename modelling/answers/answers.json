We also launched The Climate Pledge, inviting other companies to join with us on this path.\nT HIS M OM E NT we are in now has already taught us immeasurable things about how the world can and might function going forward. The planetary pause that COVID-19 has brought about to most continents--if not all at this point--shows us what happens when some of these changes happen on our planet. Planetary stability is of course tied to economic stability and the health and well-being of all people. We have yet to see what a post-COVID recovery will entail, or what the impact will be on our ability to maintain clean air, access to health, and thriving communities. With the devastation that has occurred, there is also some optimism that we might be able learn from this moment to build back our communities with more resiliency and protections for people and our planet.\nWe expect to invest approximately $4 billion in our second quarter alone on COVID-related\ninitiatives getting products to customers.\nAT AM AZON, we first began discussing the possibility of company-wide net zero commitments during a senior planning summit in 2016. We knew that to continue to be a relentlessly resilient and innovative business, we would need to deeply understand what is happening on our planet. We also knew that we would need to build and dedicate financial resources, intellectual capital, and change management work to creating the tools, data, and understanding about how to achieve these types of commitments.\nFOU R YE ARS L AT ER , our bold commitment to integrating sustainability across the company has not changed, and it will not change another five or ten years from now. What has changed, however, is the way in which we are conducting our business, running our operations, funding and implementing new technologies and services that decarbonize and help preserve the natural world, along with the ambitious goals we have set, starting with The Climate Pledge--our commitment to reach net zero carbon by 2040, a decade ahead of the Paris Agreement. We're all in on our goals and our work to build a better planet, on urgent action to drive a lasting change: to see the world transition through this current pandemic into a world that embraces a sustainable path to recovery and wellness.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY INTRODUCTION\n\n4\n\fAbout\n06 Goals and Strategies 10 The Climate Pledge 12 Right Now Climate Fund 14 The Climate Pledge Fund 15 Customers 18 Amazon Around the Globe\n\fGoals and Strategies\nAmazon is committed to building a sustainable business for our customers and the planet.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\n\n6\n\fOur Commitments\nAmazon has been committed to sustainability for many years. In 2019, Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge--a commitment to be net zero carbon across our business by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. As part of this pledge, Amazon has made ambitious commitments toward reaching this goal:\n2040 Net Zero Carbon Deploying our technology and people to reach net zero carbon across our business by 2040.\n2030 Shipment Zero\nMaking all Amazon shipments net zero carbon through Shipment Zero, with 50% of all shipments net zero carbon by 2030.\n2025 Renewable Energy On a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\n\n7\n\f100,000 Electric Delivery Vehicles Purchasing 100,000 electric delivery vehicles, the largest order ever of electric delivery vehicles.\n$100MM Right Now Climate Fund Investing $100 million in reforestation projects and climate mitigation solutions.\n$2B Climate Pledge Fund\nInvesting $2 billion to support the development of technologies and services that decarbonize and help preserve the natural world.\nTo meet these goals, teams across Amazon are taking a broad, sciencebased approach to measuring, reducing, and eliminating carbon emissions in our operations. As part of our commitment to The Climate Pledge, we are proud to join the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), reaffirming our commitment to reduce carbon emissions in line with our ongoing sciencebased approach to tackle climate change. SBTi is a collaboration between CDP, World Resources Institute (WRI), the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC); it is one of the We Mean Business Coalition commitments.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\n\n8\n\fHere is a closer look at the work we are doing:\nRenewable Energy\nAmazon is on a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025. In 2019, we reached 42% renewable energy across our business. As of December 2020, Amazon has 127 solar and wind projects across the globe that have the capacity to generate over 6,500 megawatts and deliver more than 18 million megawatt hours of energy annually--enough to power more than 1.7 million U.S. homes.\nShipment Zero\nShipment Zero is Amazon's vision to make all Amazon shipments net zero carbon, with a goal of delivering 50% of shipments with net zero carbon by 2030. Shipment Zero means that the fulfillment operations we undertake to deliver a customer's shipment are net zero carbon--from the fulfillment center where an item is picked off the shelf, to the materials used to package the item, and the mode of transportation that gets the package to the customer's door.\nElectric Vehicles\nIn 2019, Amazon ordered 100,000 new electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, a U.S. electric vehicle manufacturer. This order, the largest order ever of electric delivery vehicles, sends a signal to the marketplace to start inventing and developing new technologies that large, global companies need to transition to a low-carbon economy. Amazon plans to have 10,000 of the new electric vehicles on the road as early as 2022 and all 100,000 vehicles on the road by 2030.\nSustainable Packaging\nAmazon created our Frustration-Free Packaging program to encourage manufacturers to package their products in easy-to-open, 100% recyclable packaging that is ready to ship to customers without the need for an additional shipping box. Since 2015, we have reduced the weight of outbound packaging by 33% and eliminated more than 900,000 tons of packaging material, the equivalent of 1.6 billion shipping boxes.\nRight Now Climate Fund\nAmazon established the Right Now Climate Fund, a $100 million fund to restore and conserve forests, wetlands, and grasslands around the world. Through the Right Now Climate Fund, Amazon is taking immediate action to remove or avoid carbon emissions by supporting nature-based climate solutions. Amazon is working with The Nature Conservancy to identify projects around the world that can create real and lasting carbon reductions, while also empowering communities, enhancing natural environments, and protecting wildlife.\nClimate Pledge Fund\nIn June 2020, Amazon announced The Climate Pledge Fund to support the development of sustainable and decarbonizing technologies and services that will enable Amazon and other companies to meet the goals set by The Climate Pledge. This dedicated investment program--with an initial $2 billion in funding--will invest in visionary companies whose products and solutions will facilitate the transition to a low carbon economy.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\n\n9\n\fThe Climate Pledge was founded in 2019 by Amazon and Global Optimism. The Pledge calls on signatories to be net zero carbon across their businesses by 2040, a decade\nahead of the Paris Agreement goal of 2050.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\n\n10\n\fCompanies that sign The Climate Pledge agree to:\nRegular Reporting\nSignatories agree to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis.\nCarbon Elimination\nSignatories will implement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement through real business change and innovations,\nincluding efficiency improvements, renewable energy, materials reductions, and other carbon emission elimination strategies.\nCredible Offsets\nSignatories must take actions to neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially-beneficial\noffsets to achieve net zero annual carbon emissions by 2040.\n\n\"Bold steps by big companies will make a huge difference in the development of new technologies and industries to support a low carbon economy.\"\n Christiana Figueres, Former Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and Co-Founder of Global Optimism\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\n\n11\n\fRight Now Climate Fund\nAmazon established the Right Now Climate Fund, a $100 million fund to restore and conserve forests, wetlands, and grasslands around the world. Through the Right Now Climate Fund, we are taking immediate action to remove or avoid carbon emissions by supporting nature-based climate solutions.\nPriorities of the Right Now Climate Fund\nWe support nature-based solutions, which refer to conservation, restoration, and improved land management actions that increase carbon storage or avoid greenhouse gas emissions in forests, wetlands, and grasslands across the globe.\n Support \"And/Also\" Solutions: We use multiple solutions to reduce carbon emissions--driving reductions across our business operations and also supporting nature-based solutions.\n Demonstrate Immediate Action: We demonstrate immediate action toward reducing carbon in the atmosphere and mitigating the adverse effects of climate change.\n Promote Global Scale: We catalyze and promote nature-based solutions globally, and prioritize projects that can be scaled broadly.\n Optimize for Carbon Mitigation: We fund projects that optimize for carbon removed or avoided, while also being additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially-beneficial.\n Improve Market Mechanisms: We improve market mechanisms in order to increase the worldwide quality, supply, and demand for carbon offsets.\nGlobal Projects\nAmazon is working with The Nature Conservancy to identify projects that can create real and lasting carbon reductions, while also empowering communities, enhancing natural environments, and protecting wildlife.\nFamily Forest Carbon Program and Forest Carbon Co-ops: In April 2020, Amazon announced the funding of $10 million toward two projects that will help U.S. family forest owners sequester carbon and support expansion across Appalachia and other U.S. regions. Scientists at The Nature Conservancy have identified this network of climate-resilient forests as most able to thrive in the face of climate change. Amazon, The Nature Conservancy, the American Forest Foundation, and the Vermont Land Trust are partnering on two innovative projects--the Family Forest Carbon Program and Forest Carbon Co-ops.\nThe Family Forest Carbon Program will open up carbon credit markets to small family forest owners for the first time. Amazon's commitment will expand the program in the Appalachians and other U.S. regions and go towards designing new methods for measuring and verifying reforestation and forest management practices. The Forest Carbon Co-op will help owners of mid-sized forests use sustainable forest management and protection measures to earn income through the\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\n\n12\n\fcarbon credit market. Amazon's grant will support efforts to expand the program in climate resilient forests across the Appalachians, develop a scientific approach to regional carbon impact measurement, and enhance the project verification methodology. Amazon is the largest funder of these programs and will help:\n Conserve and sustainably manage forest land and wildlife in the Appalachian region, with plans to expand the projects across 4 million acres of the 2,000-mile span of the Appalachians, and beyond.\n Generate economic opportunities by creating a new source of income for family forest owners and rural communities that taps into the carbon storage potential of forests. In the U.S., families and individuals own the largest portion of forests (38%)--more than the federal government or corporations.\n Achieve a net reduction of up to 18.5 million metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere by 2031--the equivalent of the emissions of nearly 4 million U.S. cars in a year.\nUrban Greening in Germany: Amazon is supporting The Nature Conservancy in an effort to reduce climate change risks and increase species biodiversity in three German cities. The initial project is in Berlin's Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district. Learnings will be applied in two other German locations, and then shared across other European cities. With this, Amazon is recognizing the urgency of the climate crisis and its impacts on urban communities.\nAmazon's commitment will fund The Nature Conservancy's Urban Greening program, which uses nature-based solutions to help cities become more climate-change resilient. The program will collaborate with city officials and local community organizations to create and implement plans for:\n Reducing flood risk by improving rainwater retention through tree planting, revitalizing urban wetlands, and adapting existing green spaces;\n Reducing extreme heat and pollution by leveraging unused public spaces to plant trees and improving urban water bodies;\n Increasing urban biodiversity by introducing pollinator-friendly species, climate resilient plants, and urban grasslands.\nThe program starts in the Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district of Berlin and uses a science-based, municipality-wide, and stakeholder-based approach to urban greening to ensure that projects are complementing existing local efforts. Two additional German cities will be chosen, in which the initial learnings from Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf will be applied. The goal is to share a guide to urban greening with municipalities across Europe by the end of the five-year project.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\n\n13\n\fThe Climate Pledge Fund\nIn June 2020, Amazon announced The Climate Pledge Fund to support the development of sustainable and decarbonizing technologies and services that will enable Amazon and other companies to meet the goals set by The Climate Pledge. This dedicated investment program--with an initial $2 billion in funding--will invest in visionary companies whose products and solutions will facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy.\nIn order to meaningfully reduce the amount of net greenhouse gas emissions, low-carbon solutions need to be developed in all sectors of the global economy. The Climate Pledge Fund will invest in companies in multiple industries, with an initial focus on: transportation and logistics; energy generation, storage, and utilization; manufacturing and materials; circular economy; and food and agriculture. Companies of all sizes and stages will be considered, from preproduct startups to well-established enterprises looking to scale. The scope of The Climate Pledge Fund is global and will consider investments in companies developing products or services that reduce carbon emissions and help preserve the natural world.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\n\n14\n\fCustomers\nAmazon is committed to making it easier for our customers to participate in making a positive impact on the planet and society.\n\nsmile.amazon.com\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT\n\n15\n\fEnabling Sustainability for our Customers\nAmazon has set ambitious goals to make our business more sustainable on behalf of customers.

We measure our total impact on the climate, map the largest activities contributing to this impact, and use this information to develop meaningful carbon reduction goals, including our overall goal to reach net zero carbon across Amazon by 2040.\nOur carbon footprint includes emissions from Amazon-operated and third-party freight, electricity use, Amazon branded products, capital goods, business travel, packaging, customer trips to Amazon's stores, and other purchased goods and services. The system boundary of our carbon footprint meets widely adopted international standards, including the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and ISO 14064. Our carbon footprint is externally assured by Apex.\nThrough our commitment to The Climate Pledge, Amazon is investing in a range of large-scale solutions to decarbonize our business, some with immediate carbon savings and others with longerterm payoffs. We have already seen an improvement in the carbon intensity of our business in 2019 as a result of operational efficiencies such as energy efficiency technologies in fulfillment centers and alternative vehicle pilots. Carbon intensity is the metric we use to benchmark our performance year over year, as it provides a relative comparison between annual performance metrics regardless of other changes to our business. While Amazon's net sales increased 22% in 2019 (excluding changes in foreign exchange rates), our total carbon footprint increased 15% during the same period. While still early days, our 2019 carbon intensity metric is 122.8 grams of CO2e per GMS, down 5% year over year from 128.9 grams of CO2e per dollar in 2018.\nLike many companies in high growth mode, we look at the absolute tons of carbon in our footprint, but also at how we are improving our carbon intensity. Our first year-over-year comparison shows progress as we continue to make investments in innovation, technologies, and products that will decarbonize our operations over future years.\nThese investments include renewable energy projects like our new solar farm in Virginia, and our order of 100,000 electric delivery vehicles, which will be on the road delivering packages to customers starting in 2021. It will take several years for the carbon reduction benefits of these investments to be fully reflected in our carbon footprint. Over time, both our carbon intensity and our absolute carbon footprint will drop as we continue to make progress toward net zero carbon. With the launch of The Climate Pledge Fund, we look forward to making additional major investments in the coming years that will result in long-term payoffs.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n21\n\fAmazon's 2019 Carbon Footprint Categories\n\nMMT COe\n\nEmissions from Direct Operations (Scope 1) Fossil Fuels Refrigerants\n\n5.76 5.57 0.19\n\nEmissions from Purchased Electricity (Scope 2)\n\n5.50\n\nEmissions from Indirect Sources (Scope 3)\n\n39.91\n\nCorporate purchases and Amazon-branded product emissions (e.g., operating expenses, business travel, and Amazon-branded product manufacturing, use phase, and end of life)\n\n15.41\n\nCapital goods (e.g., building construction, servers and other 8.01\nhardware, equipment, vehicles)\n\nOther indirect emissions (e.g., third-party transportation, packaging, grid line losses)\n\n12.44\n\nLifecycle emissions from customer trips to Amazon's physical stores\n\n4.05\n\nAmazon's Total Footprint\n\n51.17\n\nOur carbon intensity metric, measured as grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (COe) per dollar of Gross Merchandise Sales (GMS), is equal to 122.8 COe per dollar (USD).\n\nCarbon Methodology\nLearn more about the science and technology behind our carbon footprint. amzn.to/measuring-carbon\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions Verification Statement\nRead the greenhouse gas emissions verification statement from Apex. amzn.to/carbon-assurance\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n22\n\fRenewable Energy\nAmazon is on a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025 as part of our goal to reach net zero carbon by 2040. In 2019, we reached 42% renewable energy across our business.\nAmazon has 127 solar and wind projects across the globe that have the capacity to generate over 6,500 megawatts (MW) and deliver more than 18 million megawatt hours (MWh) of energy annually--enough to power more than 1.7 million U.S. homes. These projects supply renewable energy for Amazon's corporate offices, fulfillment centers, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers that support millions of customers globally.\nIn March 2020, Amazon announced four new renewable energy projects--the first in Australia, second in Sweden, second in Spain, and eleventh in the Commonwealth of Virginia in the U.S. We announced five new renewable energy projects in China, Australia, and the U.S. in May 2020. In December 2020, Amazon announced plans to add 26 utility-scale wind and solar energy projects, bringing our total investment in renewable energy in 2020 to 35 projects and more than 4 gigawatts (GW) of capacity--the largest corporate investment in renewable energy in a single year. These new projects will make Amazon the largest-ever corporate purchaser of renewable energy.\nOne of our latest solar projects in the U.S. is a solar farm in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, which will power Amazon's new Virginia headquarters and other Amazon-owned operations across the Commonwealth, including Whole Foods Markets and fulfillment centers. The project is planned for completion by the first quarter of 2022. Amazon has contracted 82 MW of the new 120 MW solar farm, which is expected to generate 172,500 MWh of renewable energy annually.\nOur largest wind project to date, Amazon Wind Farm Texas, is a 253 MW wind farm in Scurry County in the western part of the state. With more than 100 turbines, the project generates 1 million MWh of wind energy annually--enough to power almost 90,000 U.S. homes for a year.\nRenewable Energy Methodology\nLearn more about how we calculate Amazon's renewable energy use. amzn.to/renewable-percentage\nRenewable Energy Assurance Statement\nRead the renewable energy assurance statement from Apex. amzn.to/energy-assurance\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n23\n\fShipment Zero\nShipment Zero is Amazon's vision to make all Amazon shipments net zero carbon, with a goal of delivering 50% of shipments with net zero carbon by 2030.\n\nShipment Zero means that the fulfillment operations we undertake to deliver a customer's shipment are net zero carbon-- from the fulfillment center where an item is picked off the shelf, to the materials used to package the item, and the mode of transportation that gets the package to the customer's door. We are working to launch Shipment Zero deliveries in Europe and the U.S., followed by India, Japan, and all other geographies where we operate across the globe.\nThe emissions sources considered in scope for Shipment Zero are:\n1. Electricity emissions from powering operations facilities and vehicle charging;\n2. Transportation tailpipe emissions from the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles that transport shipments from inventory to the customer;\n3. Emissions from manufacturing and transporting the materials used in outbound packaging.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n24\n\fFulfillment Facilities\nA Shipment Zero order will travel through fulfillment facilities powered by 100% clean energy from wind and solar projects dedicated to Amazon's electricity needs and from the grid. Customer shipments pass through the following types of facilities, all powered by clean energy:\n Fulfillment centers where Amazon associates pick, pack, and ship customer orders;  Sortation centers where customer orders are sorted by final destination and then consolidated for delivery;  Delivery stations where orders are prepared for last-mile delivery to a customer's door.\nMore than 60 Amazon facilities across the globe are already powered by on-site solar panels, which generate as much as 80% of a single fulfillment facility's annual energy needs.\nPackaging\nA Shipment Zero order will be shipped without added Amazon packaging or in carbon neutral packaging. Ships In Own Container (SIOC) is a tier of certification within Amazon's Frustration-Free Packaging program, certifying that a product's original packaging is designed to ship without the need for an Amazon shipping box. We work closely with manufacturers to develop and test packaging that meets SIOC certification, and we share these innovations publicly to drive improvements across the industry. In India, we designed a new way to deliver customer orders packaging-free. Orders that ship in their original packaging are delivered in a protective, reusable crate in 100+ cities across India.\nA second option is to ship in carbon neutral packaging that is made of net zero carbon materials, is produced with zero carbon emissions, and is delivered to Amazon fulfillment facilities using zero carbon. While we work to increase SIOCcertified products, expand packaging-free shipping programs, and develop carbon neutral packaging solutions, we will continue to pursue packaging improvements by optimizing the size and weight of shipping materials, inventing new recyclable mailers, and working with suppliers to streamline and innovate product packaging.\nTransportation\nA Shipment Zero order will be transported in a zero-emissions delivery vehicle or by a delivery associate on foot or on bicycle. Zero-emissions delivery vehicles are 100% battery electric or hydrogen-fueled, in addition to electric bikes and electric three-wheelers. Amazon's order of 100,000 electric delivery vehicles in 2019 is a major stride toward zero carbon transportation across our global network, and we are proud to operate many electric vans and trucks today. We also leverage innovative technology to maximize efficiency on the road and reduce delivery distances by placing delivery stations close to large Amazon customer populations.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n25\n\fSustainable Transportation\nTransportation is a major component of Amazon's business operations and a key part of our plan to meet net zero carbon by 2040. We are committed to optimizing and transforming our transportation network through innovations in electrification, efficiency enhancements, and alternative delivery methods.\n\nElectrifying Our Transport Fleets\nIn 2019, Amazon ordered 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, a U.S. electric vehicle manufacturer. This order, the largest order ever of electric delivery vehicles, sends a signal to the marketplace to start inventing and developing new technologies that large, global companies need to transition to a low-carbon economy. We plan to start using these new vehicles from Rivian to deliver packages to customers by 2021, with 10,000 new vehicles on the road as early as 2022 and all 100,000 vehicles on the road by 2030. This is projected to save millions of metric tons of carbon per year by 2030.\nAmazon already operates hundreds of electric vehicles across the globe. Amazon India is adding 10,000 electric delivery vehicles to its existing fleet by 2025, including 3-wheeler and 4-wheeler vehicles designed and manufactured in India. These vehicles are in addition to Amazon's order of 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from Rivian. Across Europe, Amazon is contracting with our service providers to launch a low-pollution last-mile fleet comprised of electric and natural gas vans and cars. We have added hundreds of electric vehicle charging stations at our European facilities for our partners to use, with plans to expand this infrastructure to support more sustainable deliveries. We use electric cargo bikes in cities around the world, including a pilot in New York City in 2019. In North America, Amazon has also deployed electric yard hostlers, which are used to move trailers around facilities.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n26\n\fMaximizing Efficiency on Current Vehicles\nWhile we work to adopt the most efficient, cutting-edge vehicle technologies, we are also maximizing efficiencies on our existing fleets. Across North America and Europe, our fleet includes a mix of trailers in different sizes that are equipped with skirts (panels attached to the lower side edges of a trailer to make it more aerodynamic) and automatic tire inflation systems that keep tires properly inflated and maximize fuel efficiency.\nWe use mud flaps designed to allow airflow and water to pass through them, minimizing drag and saving an average of 100 gallons of diesel fuel per vehicle annually. In Europe, we have deployed over 500 hydraulically powered doubledeck trailers. Double-deck trailers improve space utilization by up to 70% in comparison to standard semi-trailers, reducing the total number of trucks on the road.\nOptimizing Our Delivery Logistics\nAmazon is constantly working to optimize our delivery network and drive efficiencies in the process of delivering our products. To fulfill customer orders quickly, we have thousands of vehicles moving from fulfillment centers to delivery destinations. We use data and algorithms to consolidate as many shipments as possible onto one vehicle or plane. We also analyze which items are being ordered most frequently, by location, to ensure that the inventory of those items is stored nearby, minimizing the need to use planes or trucks for long-distance deliveries. By boosting efficiencies across our network, we are able to put fewer vehicles and planes into service.\nUsing Alternative Delivery Methods\nWe are continually piloting new or alternative ideas in different locations around the world in an effort to increase our efficiency and reduce emissions. In urban centers like New York City, we deliver packages on foot, have expanded our use of traditional bicycles, and use pedal-assist electric bikes connected to cargo trailers that can carry up to 45 packages. In India, our fleet includes electric three-wheelers and compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles. Electric bikes and CNG vehicles are also part of our delivery fleet in Europe. Additionally, we're developing fully electric autonomous delivery services, such as the Amazon Scout device and Prime Air drones, which will make deliveries faster and more efficient than road deliveries.\nPartnering with Experts and Industry\nIn 2017, Amazon signed the Sustainable Fuel Buyers' Principles, demonstrating our commitment to working with service providers to accelerate the transition to low-carbon commercial transportation solutions. Members of the nonprofit Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) Future of Fuels group developed The Buyers' Principles and vetted them through its network of 600 expert and industry stakeholders. These principles outline criteria that will catalyze the partnerships needed to drive the transition to a sustainable road freight transportation system.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n27\n\fSustainable Buildings\nAs part of our commitment to The Climate Pledge, Amazon is working to reduce the carbon emissions associated with our buildings and facilities across the globe. We are transitioning our buildings to be net zero carbon, powered by renewable energy, and highly energy efficient, with demonstrated reductions in embodied carbon--the emissions associated with a building's construction materials.\nWe are also working to improve the resource efficiency of our buildings beyond energy, with a focus on water and waste reduction strategies across our facilities. In all of our buildings, we seek to create safe, productive, and inspiring spaces that support the health and well-being of our employees, local environment, and community, both inside and outdoors.\nGreen Building Standards\nWe are committed to holding our buildings to the highest standards of sustainable design, and we pursue third-party building certification when doing so accelerates our impact. Amazon has nearly 30 LEED certified buildings in the U.S. --the majority of which have Gold and Platinum level certification--and more than 20 BREEAM certified buildings across Europe. We also engage with industry-leading programs that support the transition to net zero carbon in the built environment, such as the Carbon Leadership Forum.\nCorporate Offices\nOur global corporate offices are often located in vibrant communities and urban hubs. When designing our offices, we strive to integrate seamlessly with these communities while creating easy outdoor access for our employees and visitors. Many of our buildings offer public plazas and open green spaces for communal and public use. Even more feature green roofs and other green infrastructure that provide outdoor amenity space while supporting ecological functions like stormwater management.\nOur buildings' interiors integrate biophilic design concepts, such as green walls and locally-sourced woods, in addition to energy-efficient lighting, composting and recycling, and amenity spaces for employee wellness. Many Amazon buildings also offer plug-in electric vehicle charging stations for employees and visitors.\nSustainability in Action at Our Seattle Campus: Our flagship Seattle campus features some of our most innovative sustainable design practices. A subterranean district energy system heats many of our buildings in the Denny Triangle neighborhood using waste heat generated from a neighboring data center. Above ground, employees and visitors can enjoy The Spheres, an indoor plant conservatory featuring 40,000 plants from the cloud forest regions of more than 30 countries, along with a 4,000 square foot green wall.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n28\n\f100% Renewable Energy at HQ2 in Arlington: Our second U.S. headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, known as \"HQ2,\" will use 100% renewable energy to power the four-million-square-foot campus, which is scheduled to be completed by 2022. We are constructing a new solar farm in Pittsylvania County, Virginia to power HQ2 and other Amazon-owned operations in the area, including Whole Foods Market stores and nearby fulfillment centers. A portion of the renewable energy generated from this solar farm will be allocated to Arlington County, a move that also helps advance the county's renewable energy goals. The location for the HQ2 campus was strategically determined to provide walkable access to public transportation, bike storage, and local amenities such as shops, restaurants, and childcare.\nInternational Offices: We aim to take best practices from across our global locations and embed them at our offices all over the world. Our corporate offices in Munich, Germany, have been certified Gold for environmental design by the German Sustainable Building Council based on their energy-efficient interiors and use of sustainable building materials. In Luxembourg, efficient chillers and an advanced building management system cut energy costs, while rooftop beehives supply honey, and food is served in compostable and biodegradable containers.\nOperations Facilities\nWith more than 175 facilities covering 150 million square feet of space across the world, Amazon fulfillment centers, sortation centers, and delivery stations account for a major part of our embodied carbon. In 2020, Amazon began an in-depth study of our operations buildings in order to transition these facilities to net zero carbon. The study examines the energy intensity of these buildings and identifies ways to meet zero carbon through energy efficiency enhancements, new technology pilots, and significant reductions in embodied carbon. This year, Amazon will update its design templates and criteria to capture these changes, and apply net zero strategies across all global regions.\nOn-Site Solar: Many of our facilities throughout the U.S., Europe, and India are powered by on-site solar, where a rooftop installation can power up to 80% of a facility's energy use. In 2019, we achieved a goal to install solar technology on 50 rooftops worldwide by 2020, a year ahead of schedule. We now have more than 60 rooftop solar installations on operations facilities around the world and we continue to scale this program.\nMinimizing Energy Use at Operations Facilities: Our operations facilities are designed with efficient building systems to minimize energy use. We are expanding our use of building control system technology and real-time data analytics to optimize our heating and cooling systems for occupant comfort while operating as efficiently as possible. We use highly-efficient motors and advanced controls in our conveyor systems to move packages efficiently throughout our facilities, and we are testing new technologies to further reduce the energy use of material handling equipment. Through building retrofits and energy studies, we are continuously improving and learning to optimize the efficiency of our operations, uncover savings opportunities, and help drive carbon out of our fulfillment operations.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n29\n\fData Centers\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) has always focused on efficiency and continuous innovation in our data centers to improve operational excellence and reduce our impact on the environment. In addition to our efforts on energy efficiency and our goal to achieve 100% renewable energy for our global infrastructure, AWS has multiple initiatives to improve our water use efficiency and reduce the use of potable (drinking) water for cooling data centers.\nAWS develops our water use strategy by evaluating climate patterns for each AWS Region (a physical location around the world where we cluster data centers), local water management and availability, and the opportunity to conserve drinking water sources. Taking a holistic approach, we assess both the water and energy usage of each potential cooling solution to select the most efficient method.\nWhole Foods Market\nWhole Foods Market has several all-electric stores in California and dozens of buildings certified by LEED and Green Globes across North America. Every store provides a high-quality indoor experience for employees and customers, with ample daylight and amenity space. Stores in the San Francisco Bay Area have piloted a technology that combines advanced cloud computing, predictive analytics, and a thermal energy storage retrofit to modulate their refrigeration systems during peak energy.\nWhole Foods Market is a founding partner of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's GreenChill program, which helps food retailers transition to alternative refrigerants, reduce refrigerant charge sizes, eliminate leaks, and adopt green refrigeration technologies. Whole Foods Market has piloted various technologies to reduce carbon emissions from the use of refrigerants. For example, multiple stores across the U.S. and Canada use natural refrigerants, which contain zero ozone depletion potential and very low global warming potential.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n30\n\fCircular Economy\nWe are minimizing waste, increasing recycling, and providing options for our customers to\nreuse, repair, and recycle their products--sending less material to the landfill and more back into the circular economy loop.\n\n31\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n31\n\fRecycling\nAmazon is committed to reducing our environmental footprint through recycling initiatives in our own operations and for our customers. We are developing new recycling infrastructure, inventing recyclable packaging materials, and investing in initiatives that support the recycling industry across the U.S.\nRecycling Infrastructure\nIn addition to optimizing our recycling efforts for common materials like cardboard, we are working to address the materials that are toughest to recycle in our operations. Plastic film, for example, is a difficult material to process and recycle, and is not accepted by most curbside recycling programs. To address this gap, Amazon is launching plastic film recycling at more than 55 fulfillment centers across our network. Through this program, we expect to recycle more than 7,000 tons of plastic film per year, in addition to the 1,500 tons of plastic already being recycled annually in Europe.\nWe are also exploring alternative solutions for less common materials that cannot be recycled. In the UK, for example, we collect the silicone backing paper from shipping labels to convert into animal bedding. We are looking across our entire operations network to incorporate more of our own recycled plastic in products, packaging, and operational processes.\nRecyclable Mailers\nIn 2019, we launched a fully recyclable paper padded mailer that protects products during shipping while taking up less space in transit. This ensures customer deliveries arrive undamaged and in recyclable packaging with a lower carbon footprint. The recyclable mailer is made of four layers of paper and a water-based cushioning material using components commonly found in the glue used to make cardboard. The lightweight recyclable cushioning was specifically designed to easily separate from the paper in the same way that print inks and other paper coatings are removed during the paper recycling process.\nRecycling Partnerships\nAt Amazon, we know our customers care about minimizing the amount of waste that ends up in landfill. To improve curbside recycling in the U.S., we partnered with The Recycling Partnership, which supports communities and local governments with education, infrastructure, and measurement related to curbside recycling.\nWe also invested $10 million in the Closed Loop Infrastructure Fund to finance recycling and circular economy infrastructure in North America. Through this investment, Amazon aims to increase product and packaging recycling, ensuring that material gets back into the manufacturing supply chain. Over the next decade, our investment in the Closed Loop Infrastructure Fund will improve curbside recycling for 3 million homes in communities across the U.S., diverting 1 million tons of recyclable material from landfill and eliminating the equivalent of 2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n32\n\fAmazon Second Chance\nAmazon Second Chance provides information on how to trade in, recycle, or repair products, how to recycle Amazon packaging, and how to find open-box and refurbished devices. Customers may visit Second Chance to learn about and compare programs that help eliminate waste and give products a second life.\namzn.to/amsc\nCustomers who have eligible items they no longer want can discover the Amazon Trade-In program, which allows them to receive an Amazon.com Gift Card in exchange for thousands of eligible items including Amazon devices, cell phones, video games, and more. In addition, customers wanting to responsibly dispose of their electronics can discover our device recycling program for a variety of electronics and related accessories.\nAmazon also gives customers several options to shop for great deals on open-box or gently-used items. Amazon Warehouse --an online store for great deals on quality used products including furniture, toys, instruments, kitchen appliances, clothes, and more--has an extensive inspection process that ensures as many gently-used returned items as possible can be resold rather than being sent to landfill. Amazon Renewed offers refurbished, pre-owned, and open-box products such as computers, laptops, smartphones, tablets, cameras, audio devices, home appliances, and more. And Certified Refurbished and Used Amazon Devices provides customers access to pre-owned Amazon devices such as Echo, Fire Tablets, Kindle E-readers, and more. Certified Refurbished devices have been refurbished, tested, and internally certified by Amazon to look and work like new. All of these programs reduce waste and encourage reuse by ensuring that valuable products can go back into the hands of customers rather than being sent to landfills.\nAmazon also encourages customers to fix the things they buy before replacing, returning, or disposing of them. Amazon offers free Product Support (on a select but growing number of items) with the goal of helping customers maximize the useful life of the things they already own. Product Support serves seven global geographies with technical support, parts replacement, and repair services. Helping customers responsibly dispose of Amazon packaging is another key component of Second Chance. Customers are able to view various types of Amazon packaging and are provided with instructions on how and where to dispose of the materials.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n33\n\fProduct Donations\nAt Amazon facilities around the world, we are continuously expanding initiatives to maximize the positive impact of our surplus inventory. We contribute food and non-food product donations to hundreds of food banks and nonprofits, reducing landfill waste and helping our local communities.\nAmazon partners with Feeding America and Good360 to donate surplus inventory and distribute products to communities in need across the U.S. In 2019, Amazon and Whole Foods Market donated 37.5 million meals and 200,000 pounds (90,700 kilograms) of household essentials to Feeding America through its donation program.\nThroughout countries in Europe, we collaborate with local food banks and non-food charities to donate products to communities in need. Amazon is a long-term partner of the German nonprofit Innatura, which brokers in-kind donations to charitable organizations. Through this partnership, Amazon has donated to more than 1,500 charities benefiting nearly 500,000 individuals and families in Germany with donations including toys, shoes, clothing, and drugstore items, among others.\nAmazon works with In Kind Direct, a national charity in the UK that manages the donation of surplus products to charities across the country. Since partnering with In Kind Direct, we have donated more than $8.7 million (7 million) worth of products. In 2019 alone, we donated $1.2 million (1 million) to over 2,000 charities and voluntary organizations across the UK.\nAmazon is also investing in automated systems that enable third-party sellers to donate their surplus inventory to local charities. This new program has quickly become popular, with 97% of sellers on Amazon in the U.S. opting to donate their surplus inventory. This program also launched in the UK with nine local charity partners and will expand to France by the end of 2020. In the last three months of 2019 alone, third-party sellers donated a combined 3 million products to communities in need through this new automated system.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n34\n\fPackaging and Products\nWe are redesigning packaging to reduce waste and making our private-label products\nand devices in responsible ways.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n35\n\fReducing Packaging Waste\nOur customers want right-sized, recyclable packaging that minimizes waste and ensures damage-free delivery. We work to reinvent and simplify our sustainable packaging options using a science-based approach that combines lab testing, machine learning, materials science, and manufacturing partnerships to scale sustainable change across the packaging supply chain.\nSustainable Packaging Initiatives\nOur sustainable packaging initiatives reduce waste and make it easier for customers to remove products from packaging. Unlike traditional retail stores, products bought online don't need the elaborate packaging used for displaying products on store shelves. Instead, customers use star ratings and reviews to guide their online shopping decisions.\nOur Frustration-Free Packaging (FFP) program encourages manufacturers to package their products in easy-to-open packaging that is 100% recyclable and ready to ship to customers without additional Amazon boxes. Since 2015, we have reduced the weight of outbound packaging by 33% and eliminated more than 900,000 tons of packaging material, the equivalent of 1.6 billion shipping boxes.\nTo certify products under Amazon's FFP program, we help manufacturers innovate and improve their packaging functionality. By testing products in a dedicated, state-of-the-art lab in Seattle and in our fulfillment centers across the globe, we identify specific steps that manufacturers can take to\nimprove their packaging and ensure products are protected all the way to the customer's doorstep.\nToday, more than 2 million products qualify under our FFP program. Philips, for example, was inspired by our FFP program to reinvent their packaging. The new Norelco OneBlade razor design now has 80% less packaging volume, is fully recyclable, and delights customers with print on the inside of the box which enhances the opening experience\nMachine Learning\nHow big of a box is needed for a given product? Is an Amazon box needed at all? To find out, we use machine learning algorithms to arrive at the best possible packaging choices for deliveries. That means identifying which products don't need packaging at all, and which smaller products are suitable for envelopes or mailers. In cases where the protection of a box is needed, algorithms help us continuously optimize box choices to fit our ever-changing catalog. Computer-aided engineering also helps us redesign boxes to use less material while making sure customer orders are protected. These improvements\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n36\n\freduce volume per shipment, which means less unnecessary packaging and more efficient use of all forms of transportation, reducing carbon in small amounts to create a larger impact across our network.\nWe also use machine learning to help target products where even small packaging improvements can have significant impacts on reducing waste. We developed a machine learning model to identify liquid products with the highest average rates of customer reported damages. We then subjected those products to extensive additional testing at our Amazon Packaging Lab, where we simulate a package's journey from the manufacturer to the customer.\nThrough this process, we've teamed up with companies like Rieke--a packaging solutions firm that makes dispensing systems for personal care, food, and healthcare products--to provide data and packaging insights on many of the conventional dispensing systems that are used in millions of products on Amazon. By strengthening materials, creating new locking mechanisms to prevent pumps from twisting open, and sealing potential leak points, Rieke's team has created dispensers specially designed to withstand the journey to the customer. These new and improved designs include trigger sprayers common on household cleaners and personal care products, pumps for lotions, and pumps for foams.\nEngaging with Vendors and Industry\nWe work with top brands and vendors to reinvent their packaging for waste reduction in e-commerce, including optimized packaging that allow products to be shipped in their own container. The toy maker Hasbro, for example, redesigned the packaging for its popular toy, Baby Alive, reducing both the amount of material used and the overall package size by more than 50%. The pet food company Hill's Pet Nutrition reworked its packaging to make bags of kibble less likely to break and spill during shipment; testing at Amazon validated the redesigned packaging.\nWe are working across the packaging industry, using new analytics and test methods, new materials, and new ways to build enclosures that protect customer products. With packaging suppliers, for example, we have developed solutions for liquid dispensing systems on hard-to-ship items, such as household cleaners and personal care products, preventing spills and the need for extra packaging to contain spills if they happen.\nAmazon is a member of the Sustainable Packaging Coalition (SPC), an industry working group dedicated to a more robust environmental vision for packaging. SPC uses strong member support, an informed and science-based approach, supply chain collaborations, and continuous outreach to design packaging that encourages a sustainable flow of materials. Amazon has also joined the International Safe Transit Association (ISTA), an organization focused on the specific concerns of transport packaging. ISTA is a nonprofit, member-driven association that sets the standards for optimizing the resources in packages that are designed to be survivable, sustainable, and successful.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n37\n\fSustainable Products and Materials\nAmazon aims to be Earth's most customer-centric company, which means giving our customers access to the sustainable products they want. From thousands of Amazon-branded products to millions of retail and third-party items sold on Amazon, we are working to reduce the environmental impact of the products we manufacture and provide customers more information about the sustainability attributes associated with the items we sell.\n\nSustainable products cover a range of attributes intended to preserve the natural world, and we strive to help Amazon customers easily discover and shop products that exceed the environmental benefits of comparable products.\nFor Amazon-owned Private Brand products and Amazon devices, we work with many of the manufacturers and suppliers that produce our private-label selection to drive sustainability improvements through materials and ingredients, design, sourcing, and manufacturing technology. Our global teams also work closely with suppliers to communicate our human rights standards, and help suppliers build their capacity to provide safe and respectful working environments.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n38\n\fHousehold Goods\nMany Amazon customers prioritize safety and sustainability when it comes to household goods like cleaning supplies and personal care products. Customers want to be sure the products they buy are safe for their families and help preserve the planet, without compromising on quality or price.\nWe are working to increase the sustainable attributes of many of our Private Brand selections, from bio-based laundry and dish soaps that offer an effective, alternative choice to conventional formulas, to beauty products that are formulated without harmful chemicals. As part of that commitment, we implemented a Chemicals Policy and Restricted Substance List (RSL), both of which apply to Amazon-owned baby, household cleaning, personal care, and beauty brands. To support the broader retail sector's collaborative effort to use safer formulations and produce more sustainable products, Amazon joined the Retail Leadership Council of the Green Chemistry and Commerce Council (GC3).\nWe also take an active role in promoting sustainability with our selling partners. For example, we teamed up with Procter & Gamble to develop the Tide Eco-Box, a concentrated version of Tide's traditional laundry detergent compressed into a fully recyclable, shipping-safe package, which is produced using 60% less plastic and 30% less water than a conventional plastic jug. Countless other Amazon selling partners offer biodegradable and plant-based options for staples like dish detergent and multi-purpose cleaners.\nFood and Grocery\nSustainable food selection means something different to each customer. Across our Amazon food and grocery businesses, we make it easy for customers to find a range of options like free range, pasture-fed, organic, and fair trade groceries.\nAs sellers of animal-derived products, we recognize our responsibility to uphold animal welfare within our supply chain. We expect our suppliers to uphold the Five Freedoms framework for animal welfare, including freedom from hunger and thirst; freedom from discomfort; freedom from pain, injury, or disease; freedom to express normal behavior; and freedom from fear and distress. We expect our suppliers to comply with all applicable laws and to take a zero-tolerance approach to animal cruelty, abuse, and neglect. We encourage suppliers to continuously improve their animal welfare standards and practices, and to work towards recognized animal welfare certifications or industry guidelines that include welfare provisions.\nAt Whole Foods Market in the U.S., we sell high quality natural and organic foods. We research ingredients and audit sourcing practices for Whole Foods Private Brand products to make shopping easier for customers. In our meat department, products are free of added hormones or antibiotics, and no cages or tethers are permitted during the animal's daily life. Our seafood department sources only from responsibly managed fish farms and fisheries. The Whole Trade Guarantee found on produce and other items signifies that a product meets criteria that support both workers and the environment.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n39\n\fPalm Oil\nPalm oil is used extensively as an ingredient in consumer products. However, its cultivation has contributed to deforestation, biodiversity loss, and negative social impacts in some of the regions where it is grown. Our approach is to promote the use of sustainably-certified palm oil in our Private Brand food products and ask our Private Brand suppliers to source palm oil that is sustainably-certified. We are starting with Amazon-owned Private Brand food products in North America and across Europe, where our goal is to source 100% sustainable palm oil by the end of 2020.\nChemicals\nWe are committed to developing high-quality and affordable Amazon-owned Private Brand products that customers love. Part of our commitment to quality is avoiding chemicals of concern in our products that can affect human health and/or the environment. We define chemicals of concern as those chemicals that: (1) meet the criteria for classification as a carcinogen, mutagen, or reproductive or other systemic toxicant; or (2) are persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic. We strategically prioritize which chemicals of concern to focus on based on product type, customer concerns, and the availability of safer alternatives.\nThe baseline list of chemicals of concern included on our first Restricted Substance List (RSL) identifies the chemicals that we seek to avoid in Amazon-owned Private Brand baby, household cleaning, personal care, and beauty products in the U.S. and Europe. This policy is in addition to applicable local legal requirements and associated compliance plans. It will be expanded to additional brands, product categories, and geographies over time. Read more about our chemicals policy. amzn.to/materials\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n40\n\fFashion and Apparel\nAt Amazon, we're committed to making it easier for our customers to choose highquality, sustainable apparel products. We are working to lower the environmental impact of our Amazon-owned Private Brand apparel products and we partner directly with suppliers of these products to find solutions that promote the use of sustainably-produced fabrics and recycled materials. We are starting our work in the U.S. and Europe, and will expand to additional geographies over time. To incorporate industry best practices and support collective action, we are proud to collaborate with leading apparel partners, including the Better Cotton Initiative, Textile Exchange, Sustainable Apparel Coalition, and Leather Working Group.\nCotton: We are working to ensure that all cotton used in Amazon-owned Private Brand apparel products is sourced sustainably by the end of 2022. This includes cotton sourced from recycled materials, or from farms certified as organic or licensed by the Better Cotton Initiative, a global nonprofit that aims to transform the cotton supply chain by developing Better Cotton as a sustainable mainstream commodity.\nIn 2019, Amazon signed the Responsible Sourcing Network's public Cotton Pledge, committing to not source cotton from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan until the pervasive use of government-mandated forced labor is stopped. Amazon prohibits forced labor within our supply chains, and we have internal controls and external engagements to address forced labor within global supply chains. This pledge represents an additional step in that direction and lends Amazon's voice in demanding an end to forced labor in these two countries.\nCellulosic fibers: By 2022, we will ensure that none of the man-made cellulosic fibers--including rayon/viscose, lyocell, and modal--sourced for Amazon-owned Private Brand apparel products are derived from ancient and endangered forests, or from endangered species' habitats or other controversial sources, as defined by the nonprofit organization Canopy's tools and reports. Our approach to cellulosics includes using fabrics that provide assurance on traceability and use best available processing technology, as well as supporting the use of innovative lower impact alternative fiber sources, such as recycled fiber from used clothing.\nRecycled fabrics: We will increase the use of recycled fabrics in Amazon-owned Private Brand apparel products, including moving from conventional to recycled polyester, and launching products made from innovative recycled fibers. In 2020, we joined the Textile Exchange, a global nonprofit that works with its members to drive industry transformation in preferred fibers, including recycled materials.\nLeather: In 2020, we joined the Leather Working Group, a nonprofit membership organization that works to improve environmental stewardship within the global leather industry. By the end of 2023, we will source all leather used in Amazonowned Private Brand apparel and shoe products from tanneries that meet the Leather Working Group's bronze level award or higher.\nProduct labels: As of 2020, all new woven labels in Amazon-owned Private Brand apparel products are made from recycled fabric and all new swing tags are made from FSC-certified paper.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n41\n\fDevices and Sustainability\nAmazon aims to be Earth's most customer-centric company, which means as part of Amazon's commitment to The Climate Pledge, we are working to make Amazon devices more sustainable, from how we make them to how customers use them. We complete life cycle assessments to help us understand the environmental impact of each device type and use these learnings to set goals, from using recycled materials to investing in renewable energy. We are building a future in which customers will be able to control their smart homes or read, listen, and watch on their devices, knowing that Amazon is reducing its carbon footprint.\n\nRecycled Materials\nWe are incorporating recycled plastics, fabrics, and metals into many new Amazon devices, giving new life to materials that could otherwise end up in waste streams. The recycled materials used in our devices launching in 2020 could fill over 800 garbage trucks worth of plastics, fabrics, and aluminum.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n42\n\fDevice Packaging\nWhen it comes to sustainability, we are not just focused on improving our devices, but on their packaging too. We are working to source 100% of the wood fiber in this packaging from responsibly managed forests or recycled sources. We're reducing single-use plastic, eliminating over 9 million bags from our device packaging in 2020 alone. Our goal is to make Amazon devices packaging 100% curbside recyclable and plastic-free by 2023. We are also redesigning the shipping package to reduce waste.\nEnergy\nWe strive to make our devices energy efficient because it's good for the planet and our customers. That's why we've added a Low Power Mode feature to select devices that reduces their energy consumption during periods of inactivity over their lifetime. Making our devices more energy efficient is not enough to get to net zero carbon. So, starting in 2020, Amazon is building new wind and solar farms to produce clean energy equivalent to the electricity used by every customer's Echo device. We have a bold goal to continue building new renewable energy projects until we account for the energy consumption of all Amazon devices.\nInvesting in Clean Energy\nAmazon works with energy companies to bring new renewable projects online to produce clean energy equivalent to the electricity used by our devices. To size these projects, we model and measure the energy consumed by our devices in different types of use, then project their total average global annual electricity consumption. The first new wind and solar farms are expected to come online in 2022 and 2023, and will produce clean energy equivalent to the electricity used by every customer's Echo device. Until then, we will invest in renewable energy certificates to support clean energy projects, matching the quantity of electricity our customers' Echo devices use until the new projects come online. Our Amazon renewable energy portfolio is global, and in the coming years we will expand our devices renewable energy portfolio into other regions where our devices are used.\nAlexa\nCustomers can track and manage the energy consumed by compatible devices in their homes with an energy dashboard, coming soon to the Alexa app. Plus, if Alexa has a Hunch that a customer is away and forgot to turn off a light, Alexa will automatically turn it off -- helping customers conserve energy without even thinking about it. Collectively, this can help save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\nTrade In or Recycle\nWe build our devices to last, but there may come a time when customers want to trade in or recycle their device. Customers in the U.S. can explore their options with Amazon Second Chance. Eligible devices qualify for an Amazon.com Gift Card equal to the value of the trade-in, plus a discount toward the purchase of a new eligible Amazon device. For devices that are not eligible for trade-in, we offer customers a recycling program for electronic items including Amazon devices and accessories.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n43\n\fThe Cloud\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is committed to running our business in the most\nenvironmentally friendly way possible and achieving 100% renewable energy usage for our\nglobal infrastructure.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n44\n\fLearn how AWS is working to achieve Amazon's goal of 100% renewable energy.\n\nJAN 2016\n\nAPR 2015\n\nAmazon announces joining the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) and will participate in the U.S. Partnership for Renewable Energy Finance (U.S. PREF) to increase our work with state and federal policymakers and other stakeholders to enable more renewable energy opportunities for cloud providers.\n2014\n\nNOV 2015\n\nJUL 2015\n\nAWS announces that it has contracted with Iberdrola Renewables, LLC to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm U.S. East.\nAWS announces that it has contracted with EDP Renewables to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm U.S. Central.\n\nJUN 2016\n\nAmazon launches Wind Farm Fowler Ridge, marking the first of our four announced renewable energy projects to move into full operation.\n\nAWS and Dominion Virginia Power join forces on a landmark renewable energy delivery deal.

More than twothirds of this advantage is attributable to the combination of a more energy efficient server population and much higher server utilization. AWS data centers are also more energy efficient than enterprise sites due to comprehensive efficiency programs that touch every facet of the facility. When we factor in the carbon intensity of consumed electricity and renewable energy purchases, which reduce associated carbon emissions, AWS performs the same task with an 88% lower carbon footprint.\" amzn.to/cloud-efficiency\n\nSource: 451 Research, 2019.

In addition to our efforts on energy efficiency and our goal to achieve 100% renewable energy for our global infrastructure, AWS has multiple initiatives to improve our water use efficiency and reduce the use of potable (drinking) water for cooling data centers.\nAWS develops our water use strategy by evaluating climate patterns for each AWS Region, local water management and availability, and the opportunity to conserve drinking water sources. Taking a holistic approach, we assess both the water and energy usage of each potential cooling solution to select the most efficient method.\nEvaporative Cooling\nWhen possible, AWS incorporates direct evaporative technology for cooling our data centers, significantly reducing energy and water consumption. During cooler months, outside air is directly supplied to the data center without using any water. During the hottest months of the year, outside air is cooled through an evaporative process using water before being pushed into the server rooms, and we have optimized our cooling systems to use minimal water. AWS is constantly innovating the design of our cooling systems to further reduce water use, and we utilize real-time sensor data to adapt to changing weather conditions.\nRecycled Water\nAWS is expanding its use of non-potable water for cooling purposes to help conserve local drinking water sources. In Northern Virginia, AWS was the first data center operator to be approved to use recycled water with direct evaporative cooling technology. We partnered with Loudoun Water to demonstrate the benefits of recycled water for industrial cooling applications, and shared our operational best practices for utilizing recycled water in our data centers. In the AWS U.S. West (Oregon) Region, we have partnered with a local utility to use non-potable water for multiple data centers, and we are retrofitting AWS data centers in Northern California to use recycled water.\nThe process for utilizing recycled water begins when wastewater from residential and industrial customers is treated at a local facility and redistributed through its own piping infrastructure. Recycled water has to meet stringent health standards and safe surface discharge standards.\nAWS is working with local utilities to expand distribution infrastructure and drive faster implementation and adoption of recycled water for data center cooling applications, in order to reduce our usage of potable water.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n48\n\fOn-Site Water Treatment\nAWS is implementing on-site modular water treatment systems in multiple regions. As water is cycled through evaporative cooling units, minerals build up as water evaporates, eventually reaching a level of concentration that requires replacement with fresh water. On-site water treatment allows us to remove scale-forming minerals and reuse water for more cycles. Increasing our \"cycles of concentration\" allows us to continue to reduce water intake for cooling our data centers.\nWater Efficiency Metrics\nIn the infrastructure regions where we use water for cooling, AWS has developed water efficiency metrics to determine and monitor optimal water use for each AWS Region, and we employ a data-driven approach to select the most effective water reduction technologies. Water metrics from each of our Regions help AWS evaluate technologies and understand the long-term impacts on our water usage, in order to increase efficiency as our infrastructure grows and we expand to new regions.\nWe are partnering with utilities to connect directly to utility water meters, and we are also installing our own meters to track real-time water usage to provide consistent data for our operations and sustainability teams. By analyzing this data, AWS can identify opportunities to reduce water usage and rapidly make operational changes, rather than waiting for bills or usage reports.\nAWS will continue to implement these strategies and test new technologies in order to reduce our water consumption and conserve potable water sources. Saving water is good for the environment and also benefits our customers as we increase our operational efficiency.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n49\n\fAmazon Sustainability Data Initiative\nThe Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) seeks to accelerate sustainability research and innovation by minimizing the cost and time required to acquire and analyze large sustainability datasets.\nASDI currently works with scientific organizations like NOAA, NASA, the UK Met Office and Government of Queensland to identify, host, and deploy key datasets on the AWS Cloud, including weather observations, weather forecasts, climate projection data, satellite imagery, hydrological data, air quality data, and ocean forecast data. These datasets are publicly available to anyone. In addition, ASDI provides cloud grants to those interested in exploring the use of AWS' technology and scalable infrastructure to solve big, long-term sustainability challenges with this data. The dual-pronged approach allows sustainability researchers to analyze massive amounts of data in mere minutes, regardless of where they are in the world or how much local storage space or computing capacity they can access.\nInnovating for Sustainability in the Cloud\nFrom university researchers to local governments, federal agencies to private startups, many organizations are leveraging ASDI to better understand the long-term opportunities to address big challenges like climate change. Below are some examples of how AWS customers are innovating and problem solving for sustainability.\n Satellite imagery for five countries in Africa has been compiled in the African Regional Data Cube (managed by the UN Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data), a tool developed in the AWS Cloud that enables authorities in countries like Ghana, Sierra Leone and Senegal to monitor deforestation, illegal mining and manage coastal erosion.\n In Virginia, flood-prone towns are using sensors to monitor water levels and upload them to the AWS cloud as part of the StormSense project. Local residents can ask Alexa about water levels in specific places or subscribe to an app with alerts on dangerous flooding. \"The only way you can scale this well is by being in the cloud,\" said Sridhar Katragadda, data officer for the City of Virginia Beach, which is participating in the project.\n Projects like Temperate and CalAdapt are also providing cloud-based tools to help communities better understand and prepare for climate change. These projects leverage large datasets staged on AWS to evaluate future climate changes and how those changesmay impact people, assets, and operations.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n50\n\f The BlueDot Observatory is using open satellite Earth Observations on AWS to monitor closely at-risk inland water bodies. The tool hopes to raise awareness about the vulnerability of these water resources and to provide timely insights that inform water management efforts.\n Some work that ASDI is enabling is more foundational and is expanding our knowledge and understanding of key processes. For example, a group of researchers at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the American Bird Conservancy published some exciting understandings about bird migration patterns based on NOAA's NEXRAD weather data that is freely available on AWS.\nASDI supports innovators and researchers with the data, tools, and technical expertise they need to move sustainability to the next level.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENT\n\n51\n\fPeople\n53 Human Rights 60 Employees 73 Supply Chain 85 Community\n\fHuman Rights\nAmazon is committed to ensuring the people and communities that support our entire value chain are treated with fundamental dignity and respect, and we strive to ensure the products and services we provide are produced in a way that respects\ninternationally recognized human rights.\n!\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n53\n\fOur Approach to Human Rights\nOur approach is informed by international standards: we respect and support the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Core Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.\nOur human rights strategy has four pillars:\n1 Strong Policies\nOur efforts are anchored in policies that apply across all aspects of our business--from our own operations, to our supply chain, to the communities in which we operate. In 2019, we codified our commitment to human rights in Amazon's Global Human Rights Principles, which underline the importance we place on embedding respect for human rights throughout our business.\n Human Rights Principles From the associates in our fulfillment centers, to the drivers delivering packages to our customers, to the factory workers making the products we sell--people are critical to our mission of being earth's most customer-centric company. These values have been long-held at Amazon and codifying them into a set of Human Rights Principles demonstrates our support for fundamental human rights and the dignity of workers everywhere we operate around the world.\n Supply Chain Standards We set a high bar for ourselves and our suppliers. Our Supply Chain Standards detail the requirements and expectations for suppliers in our supply chain and are grounded in principles of inclusivity, continuous improvement, and supply chain accountability. We engage with suppliers that are committed to these same principles; suppliers commit to these standards as a condition of doing business with us.\nWe are committed to consistently evolving and improving our approach. We continuously review our policies and, at least every other year, conduct an in-depth benchmarking of our policies against international standards and evolving industry best practices to identify areas for update and improvement.\n2 Embedding Human Rights Into Our Business\nIn order to prevent and mitigate adverse impacts in the long run, we are committed to embedding human rights considerations into decision-making across the company and into our policy and governance framework. This governance starts with the Amazon Board of Directors, which appoints committees for oversight on specific issues. Among other duties, its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees Amazon's global environmental, corporate social responsibility, and corporate governance policies and initiatives, and its Leadership Development and Compensation Committee oversees Amazon's global human capital management strategies and policies.\nWe are also building an employee training and engagement program to raise awareness of important human rights topics across the company. For example, in 2019, we launched training on human trafficking and forced labor for employees in our logistics network--educating our employees on how to recognize the warning signs of this criminal behavior.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n54\n\fHuman Trafficking Awareness\nAmazon does not tolerate the use of child labor, forced labor, or human trafficking in any form--including slave labor, prison labor, indentured servitude, or bonded labor--in our operations or value chain. We have detailed the components of this commitment to combating human trafficking (also referred to as \"modern slavery\") in our annual Modern Slavery Statement, our Supply Chain Standards, and our Global Human Rights Principles.\nWe're raising awareness through employee training and partnerships. As a global retail and technology company employing hundreds of thousands of workers around the world, we recognize the responsibility and opportunity we have to raise awareness among our employees through education and training on relevant human rights and social responsibility issues. In 2019, we launched a human trafficking awareness program for employees around the world. In the program's first phase, we trained fulfillment network managers in our UK operations. In 2020, we expanded this training to teach employees across our entire global fulfillment network to recognize signs of modern slavery using localized scenarios.\nThe training focuses on raising awareness and teaching employees how to identify indicators of modern slavery and report concerns to appropriate authorities in a way that puts the interests of victims first. To develop the training, we relied on input from organizations with expertise in modern slavery, including Verit, a recognized leader in global labor protections, and incorporated videos and materials from the Gangmasters and Labor Abuse Authority (GLAA), a UK public agency focused on investigating labor exploitation. In 2020, we expanded our English training module to cover more languages and are developing region-specific training for our global employees. Our global security operations team has immediate response protocols in the event of a suspected human trafficking related issue, regardless of where the issue arises.\nIn October 2019, we became an official corporate sponsor of Truckers Against Trafficking (TAT), an organization dedicated to combating human trafficking in the trucking industry, and began incorporating TAT training modules into trainings for our internal fleet of drivers to teach them how to identify and respond to potential victims of human trafficking. Our goal is to train 100% of our internal fleet of drivers on the Truckers Against Trafficking curriculum by the end of 2020.\nOur social responsibility team regularly reviews and updates Amazon's approach to human trafficking prevention and updates executive leadership on our progress throughout the year.\n\n3 Transparency and Stakeholder Engagement\nWe are committed to driving industry-wide best practices in human rights due diligence through increased disclosures about our approach and expanding our stakeholder engagement.\nIn 2019, we published our first interactive supplier map that provides details on suppliers of Amazon-branded apparel, consumer electronics, and home goods products. We expanded the map in 2020 to include additional suppliers and product categories, and to include information on capacity building programs completed by individual suppliers. In 2020, we disclosed additional information about our supplier assessment process and audit results, about our approach to worker engagement, and about the goals we have set for ourselves on such topics as forced labor training and women's empowerment. To continue to expand our disclosures and transparency on these issues, we report against the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights Reporting Framework.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n55\n\fEngagement with external stakeholders is key to our human rights due diligence approach. We rely on experts and affected rights holders to inform our approach and ensure our efforts have the intended impact. In the last year, we have built new relationships with: the Better Buying Initiative to promote improved purchasing practices, Nest to improve conditions in the handworker economy, the Amader Kotha Worker Helpline to provide access to grievance for workers in the Bangladesh garment sector, Truckers Against Trafficking to train our drivers on how to identify victims of human trafficking, and Unseen to support the UK Modern Slavery Helpline and Resource Centre. Through these partnerships we access invaluable expert input to our work, helping us achieve greater impact on working conditions around the world.\n4 Mechanisms to Address Risk\nWe are committed to identifying, preventing, and mitigating adverse human rights impacts, and are continuously working to improve our approach.\nIn our supply chain, we assess and respond to risk by leveraging internal and external data, and guidance from external stakeholders including industry experts, civil society groups, and non-governmental organizations. We use independent auditors to verify compliance with our Supply Chain Standards though regular on-site inspections and confidential worker interviews. We also recognize that audits alone are insufficient to drive long-term change across industries. We are exploring new ways to encourage improvement in worker protections, including supplier capacity building programs, worker trainings, and collaborations with other brands and civil society.\nWithin our own operations, we have teams dedicated to assessing and addressing risk to our employees. Those teams focus on employee engagement--establishing open communication with our employees around the world and providing them with meaningful grievance mechanisms and avenues for dialogue with leadership. We are dedicated to building a diverse and inclusive workplace, where every employee feels comfortable sharing their unique perspectives and is supported in growing their career. And, we are obsessed with keeping our employees safe while on the job. We are working relentlessly to innovate and create new industry benchmarks for health and safety.\nWe know we have more to do--we are committed to continuously widening our lens to better understand the potential human rights impacts of our business. In 2020, we are partnering with sustainability and human rights consulting firm Article One Advisors to identify salient human rights risks across our business. The UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework recommends this systematic review of risks as a way to prioritize a company's work on human rights. The results will help us prioritize and design human rights impact assessments--deep dives on specific products, regions, or risk areas, which we will communicate to customers and stakeholders.\nOUR GOALS: Launch a review of Amazon's salient human rights risks by the end of 2020. Execute our first human rights impact assessment by the end of 2020.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n56\n\fAmazon Global Human Rights Principles\nWe are committed to ensuring the people, workers, and communities that support our entire value chain are treated with fundamental dignity and respect. We strive to ensure that the products and services we provide are produced in a way that respects human rights.\nWhile it is the duty of governments to protect human rights, Amazon recognizes our responsibility to respect and uphold internationally recognized human rights through the ethical treatment of our workforce and those within our value chain. Guided by the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we commit to embedding respect for human rights throughout our business. We continuously evaluate our operations and value chain to identify, assess, and address salient human rights risks; engage key stakeholders; and prioritize key areas where we have the greatest opportunity to have a positive impact on workers and communities. Our approach on human rights is informed by international standards; we respect and support the Core Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nWe are committed to investing in our employees, the workers who make our products, and the communities in which we operate. These principles outline our approach to human rights across all aspects of our company.\nOur Workplace\nWe endeavor to provide safe, inclusive, and respectful workplaces, in both our own operations and those throughout our value chain.\nSafe and Healthy Workplaces: We strive to be the most safety-centric organization in the world. We provide a clean, safe, and healthy work environment. The health, wellness, and safety of our workers is our number one priority. Everyone has the right to a safe and healthy workplace with appropriate rules and practices for reporting and preventing accidents, injuries, and unsafe conditions, procedures, or behaviors.\nDiversity and Inclusion: We are committed to diversity and inclusion throughout our business. We seek individuals from all backgrounds to join our teams, and we encourage people to bring their authentic, original, and best selves to work.\nEqual Opportunity: We are committed to ensuring that all workers are treated equally, and we do not tolerate discrimination based on race, color, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, creed, the presence of any physical, sensory, or mental disabilities, age, political ideology, pregnancy, citizenship, migrant status, veteran status, ethnicity, ancestry, caste, marital or family status, or other legally protected status in hiring and working practices, such as job applications, promotions, job assignments, training, wages, benefits, and termination. Our aim is to ensure employment decisions and actions are based only on business-\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n57\n\frelated considerations--focused solely on an individual's ability to perform the work, not their personal characteristics. As outlined in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, we do not tolerate discrimination, violent and threatening behavior, or harassment.\nFreely Chosen Employment: We do not tolerate the use of child labor, forced labor, or human trafficking in any form--including slave labor, prison labor, indentured servitude, or bonded labor--in our operations or value chain.\nEmployee Communication: We value worker feedback. We firmly believe it is in our employees' and the company's best interests to continue our direct communications, and the best way to effect positive change is for our employees to continue working directly with their managers throughout the company. We respect freedom of association and our employees' right to join, form, or not to join a labor union or other lawful organization of their own selection, without fear of reprisal, intimidation, or harassment. We provide training to employees on topics covered within the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, including how to submit anonymous complaints to Amazon's third-party Ethics Hotline. We are committed to providing our employees with appropriate access to grievance mechanisms and remedial action.\nOur Suppliers\nWe promote safe, inclusive, and respectful workplaces with our third-party suppliers and service providers. We seek suppliers committed to these same principles. Amazon's Supply Chain Standards set forth requirements governing labor standards and working conditions. We implement this commitment through dedicated programs that communicate our expectations to the third-parties we work with, monitor working conditions where Amazon-branded products are made or services provided, implement plans to address issues and make improvements where necessary, and engage with stakeholders working to address specific and systemic issues.\nHow We Do This\nIntegration Throughout our Business: We expect and encourage everyone in our business to embed these principles into their everyday work and provide employee training to raise awareness on them. We strive to evaluate and understand the impact of each part of our business on human rights, to address and mitigate negative impacts, and to invest in the people behind the products and services we provide.\nContinuous Improvement: To ensure we are continuing to hold the highest standards, we continuously review our policies and practices to ensure alignment with these principles and regularly provide updates on progress to senior leadership.\nCollaboration: In support of these efforts, we value ongoing collaboration with a broad range of stakeholders, helping us remain vigilant and aware of the potential impacts--both positive and negative--of our products and services on the rights, interests, and well-being of our employees, customers, and communities around the world.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n58\n\fOur Business\nAmazon seeks to be Earth's most customer-centric company. We are passionate builders guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. We bring these principles to everything we do, including how we approach human rights.\nOur Operations: Amazon believes the people, workers, and communities who support our business should be treated with fundamental dignity and respect. As of July 2020, we employed approximately 876,800 full-time and part-time workers across the globe. We manage our operations, including the people working in them, in three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Our online and physical stores enable hundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties. We source, manufacture, sell, and deliver millions of products to consumers.\nOur Products: Amazon Consumer Private Brands and Amazon Devices offer our customers products spanning diverse categories including apparel, food and beverage, electronics, and home goods. Amazon's suppliers are located around the world and produce, manufacture, assemble, or provide goods or services that are sold and delivered to Amazon.\nThird-Party Sellers: Third parties sell products directly to customers on Amazon.com spanning broad product categories. These orders are either fulfilled by Amazon using our operations or shipped directly by the seller to the customer.\nFulfillment and Logistics: More than 250,000 full-time associates support our global network of fulfillment centers. Amazon Fulfillment is where our employees, technology, and innovation come together every day to deliver for our customers. Fulfillment facilities run multiple shifts per day, and employees perform a number of roles--from leading teams to boxing up orders and shipping directly to our customers. We fulfill customer orders in a number of ways using our transportation supply chain. We operate North America and International fulfillment and delivery networks and have co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries. We also provide digital delivery and offer products in our physical stores as well.\nAWS: AWS offers over 175 fully featured services from data centers globally. Ours is the largest global infrastructure footprint of any provider, and this footprint is constantly increasing. AWS teams around the world are building the future. Our people solve a wide variety of technical challenges, always focusing on the customer. Millions of customers-- including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies--trust AWS to power their technology infrastructure. aws.amazon.com\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n59\n\fEmployees\nFrom our software engineers, to the associates in our fulfillment centers, to the drivers delivering packages\nto our customers--our employees are critical to our mission of being Earth's most customer-centric\ncompany. Our ranks are full of smart, passionate people who are building new products and services\nevery day on behalf of our customers.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n60\n\fWorkplace Health and Safety\nSafety is a top priority throughout our fulfillment operations and on the roads in communities where we operate. Our vision is to synthesize leading health and safety expertise with Amazon's tech capabilities and relentless innovation to create new industry benchmarks for the health and safety of our employees. Leaders in our facilities set the example for the highest safety standards.\nFrom coaching and ergonomic training to ensuring processes and equipment in work areas are safely operated, leaders proactively verify and validate that safety protocols are followed. The industry-leading safety technology we use every day is designed to protect and promote our employees' health, and we consistently test and refine processes to improve working conditions in our facilities.\nAbove all, safety at Amazon is about our people and partners. In 2019, we provided more than one million hours of safety training to employees. To make it all happen, we employ one of the largest health and safety organizations on the planet, with approximately 5,000 people worldwide focused on safety. Safety, however, is the responsibility of each and every person working at Amazon. In Amazon's dynamic, positive safety culture, every team is engaged and encouraged to look out for one another.\nSome of Amazon's recent investments and technologies that support employees and make our workplaces safer include:\nSafety Leadership Index (SLI): Amazon employees across the world are routinely surveyed through our innovative Connections program. Employees are asked the same series of questions each month, and those answers are used to measure employees' perception of safety at each of our facilities. An example of the kinds of questions which are asked include, \"Does your manager care about the safety of you and your team?\" Amazon employees have provided thousands of safety ideas, concerns, and suggestions since the program started, and Amazon has implemented more than 600 changes as a result of these responses. Last year, thanks to SLI feedback, we made personal safety equipment more easily available through free vending machines placed in fulfillment centers in several U.S. locations. Thanks to this improvement, employees can now get new equipment any time they want, which enhances safety for everyone.\nWorkingWell: Over the past two years, we've developed WorkingWell, a program that uses academic research and certified athletic trainers to educate employees and leaders about health and wellness. WorkingWell is a training and conditioning program designed for new hires and tenured employees, which includes a new hire ramp-up schedule aimed at preventing musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). It also includes a two-week classroom course about proper body movements, health, and wellness, as well as routine safety training engagements.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n61\n\fMind and Body Moments: Piloted in 2019, this new program employs 30-second, guided physical and mental exercises, offered directly at an employee's workstation. The intent of these \"moments\" is to help reduce muscle fatigue and stress, thereby promoting wellness and mitigating injury risks. Employees at pilot sites have reported statistically significant reductions in discomfort. We've seen a nearly 13% improvement in employees who report no discomfort at all during their workday. We will continue to evaluate expansion of this program to other site types and countries, targeting the rest of North American and European facilities with expanded language offerings.\nSafety Capital Investments: Our facilities are purposefully designed to incorporate innovative technologies that enhance safety and improve efficiency. We don't stop there. In 2020, we are making a substantial investment in the safety of our people and facilities, with $296 million earmarked for safety-related programs in the U.S. alone. As examples of past investments, in 2019, we invested $14 million to further improve the safety of employee parking lots at our facilities; $9 million to retrofit pallet racking with state-of-the art equipment; and $1.6 million on pedestrian safety controls in some of our specialized distribution centers.\nPowered Industrial Truck Technology: Powered Industrial Trucks (PIT) are an important part of any warehousing operation. Our goal of eliminating PIT incidents can only be met if we take a leadership role in innovating in this industry and developing technologies not currently available in the market. We are partnering with vendors and investing $66.5 million to pilot PIT units that incorporate real time location systems (RTLS) and light detection and ranging technology (LiDAR). Additionally, we are augmenting telemetry controls on PITs we already own, which allows us to better monitor and control speeds in congested areas, implement access control, and ensure only certified operators are able to activate PITs.\nRobotic Tech Vest: Several reports of near misses at our robotic sites, involving objects inadvertently falling into the path of drive units, led us to invest $9.8 million into engineering controls that could significantly reduce these types of risk. These controls were implemented before any human injury occurred, which speaks to how seriously we take near misses and how we're constantly looking to improve safety. One example of such investment is the Robotic Tech Vests worn by employees at Amazon Robotics facilities, which allow robotic drive units to detect employees and plan alternative travel paths to avoid interactions.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n62\n\fInvestments in Our Employees\nWe know that a strong culture and active investment in our people allows us to attract the diverse, innovative employees we need to understand and exceed our customers' expectations today and into the future. We are committed to providing the support, benefits, and opportunities our employees need to be successful, whether they are building their careers at Amazon or building skills with us to help them on their career journey.\n876,800 full-time and part-time employees globally as of July 2020.\n$15 per hour minimum wage for 100% of full-time, part-time, and temporary U.S. employees\nComprehensive benefits from day one for 100% of full-time employees.\nUp to 20 weeks paid parental leave.\n24-hour a day free confidential counseling services.\nOver 90% of Amazon regular full-time and part-time employees in the U.S. are eligible for healthcare benefits.\nMore than 30,000 veterans and military spouses employed by the company, surpassing our goal of 25,000 by 2021.\nUpskilling 2025 commitment: a $700 million commitment to pilot, launch, and scale training programs for 100,000 Amazonians by 2025.\nOver the last decade, no other U.S.-based company has created more jobs than Amazon. Our investments have led to the creation of over 2 million direct and indirect jobs in the U.S. alone.\nFor example, in the U.S., Amazon's minimum wage begins at $15 an hour (in the UK at 9.50 GBP per hour and in Canada at 16 CAD per hour) for all full-time, part-time, temporary (including those hired by agencies), and seasonal employees. In addition to our $15 minimum wage, we offer full-time employees industry-leading benefits starting on their first day of employment with Amazon. These include: comprehensive healthcare coverage with affordable premiums (paycheck contributions) that extend to eligible family members, including medical, prescription drug, dental, and vision coverage; a 401(k) with a 50% match up to 4% of compensation; a Flexible Spending Account for health and dependent care; 24-hour a day free and confidential counseling services; and paid time off and holiday overtime pay. In 2020, Amazon is collaborating with Crossover Health to establish convenient health centers in the communities where our fulfillment centers and operations facilities are located, starting in Texas, with additional centers planned for other states in the months ahead.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n63\n\fWe are proud to offer generous, flexible paid leave for all parents--from our most senior executives to our hourly employees, including parents of all genders and adoptive parents. Birth mothers get up to 20 weeks of paid leave and non-birth parents have access to six weeks paid leave. We also offer Leave Share--an innovative program that allows Amazonians to share their parental leave with a partner whose employer does not provide paid parental leave. Additionally, Ramp Back enables employees to return to work on a flexible schedule for up to eight weeks after birth or adoption. Where possible we provide unlimited gender transition benefits, including gender affirmation. We have internal resources to help managers and team members support employees who are going through a gender transition.\nFor employees reaching their one-year employment mark, we offer our innovative Career Choice Program, which prepays 95% of tuition for courses in high-demand fields. Since the program's launch eight years ago, more than 40,000 employees in 14 countries have pursued degrees in five broad fields of study: IT, Healthcare, Advanced Manufacturing and Skilled Trades, Administration and Business Services, and Transportation. We are also now offering graduate-school-level training for our employees through Machine Learning University, a program designed to give current Amazon employees the chance to develop expertise in machine learning, critical skills in an area of rapidly growing professional opportunities within and outside of Amazon.\n\nAdditional employee benefits include:\n\nA free employee assistance program, which provides confidential 24/7 support, resources, and referrals for different aspects of work and personal life.\n\nOnline resources for parents whose children experience developmental disabilities, as well as help finding child and elder care referrals and assistance.\n\nFinancial counseling, estate planning, and other services in the event of a lifethreatening illness or death.\n\nAdoption assistance for qualified domestic and international adoption expenses including attorney fees, court costs, and travel.\n\nCompany-paid basic life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, with the option to enroll in additional coverage for dependents.\n\nAdoption benefits, including reimbursement for parents of up to $5,000 per child associated with the domestic or international adoption of a child.\n\nFertility treatment coverage.\n\nCompany-paid short-term and long-term disability.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n64\n\fDiversity and Inclusion\nOur customers represent diversity in many forms--and we serve them better with a diverse and inclusive team. Our diverse perspectives help us push each other to think bigger, and differently, about the products and services we build for our customers and the day-to-day nature of our workplace.\nWe want our employees and the communities we operate in to embrace that we are all human, we are all different, and we are all equal. Coming into work, every Amazonian should feel comfortable sharing their unique perspectives and seeking out the perspectives of others--this is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and constantly earn others' trust.\nOur Workforce Data\n\nData reflects metrics as of December 31, 2019. Among Amazon's global employees, 42.7% identify as women and 57.3% identify as men. Among managers globally, 27.5% identify as women and 72.5% identify as men. In the U.S., 15.4% of Amazon employees identify as Asian, 26.5% as Black/African American, 18.5% as Hispanic/Latinx, 1.3% as Native American, 3.6% as two or more races, and 34.7% as White. Among managers in the U.S., 20.8% identify as Asian, 8.3% as Black/African American, 8.1% as Hispanic/Latinx, 0.6% as Native American, 3.0% as two or more races, and 59.3% as White.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n65\n\fGender Pay Gap A review of the compensation awarded in 2019 at Amazon, including both base and stock, shows that women earned 99.3 cents for every dollar that men earned performing the same jobs, and minorities earned 99.1 cents for every dollar that white employees earned performing these same jobs. We continue to prioritize pay equity.\nDiversity\nWe recognize we have room for improvement and we are not yet where we need to be. Increasing diversity in our workforce is a collective challenge that requires a team effort; it calls for both near- and long-term strategies:\nBuilding an Inclusive Culture To better understand what inclusion means for our employees, we conducted a global internal survey which led to Amazon's definition of inclusion: \"Being valued, trusted, connected, and informed so that we can deliver the best results for our customers.\" We use this definition to guide us as we create educational initiatives, continually improve our mentorship program, and deliver benefits for all of our employees. Amazon has 12 affinity groups created and led by employees-- comprised of over 50,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally--who passionately and positively impact our company, each with an executive sponsor that ensures these groups are engaging at every level of the company. Groups such as Amazon People with Disabilities, Amazon Women in Engineering, the Black Employees Network, and Glamazon (for LGBTQIA+ employees and their allies) lead in community-building, mentorship, and programs to build awareness around customer inclusion. We engage and consult their leaders and seek their ideas to improve our inclusion efforts internally and externally. Our efforts have received external recognition: we are proud to have been recognized on the NAACP Equity, Inclusion, and Empowerment Index and the Disability Equality Index.\nDeveloping the Pipeline and Hiring the Best Talent We recognize there is a diversity problem in tech. We are investing in solving this in our own company as well as building out the next generation of technical talent for the industry and expanding the opportunities for students from underrepresented backgrounds. Our efforts focus on two goals. First, contribute to changing the talent pipeline long-term. Last year we announced Amazon Future Engineer, a childhood to career program that will inspire and teach more than 10 million underprivileged and underrepresented students each year about computer science. And in 2017, we committed $50 million over five years to STEM programs for diverse communities. Second, we want to immediately accelerate this change. To find the best talent now for technical and non-technical roles, we actively partner with organizations and academic institutions that reach underrepresented communities like Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), and women's colleges. In addition, we've created nontraditional learning pathways, like the Amazon Veteran Technical Apprenticeship, which places transitioning members of the military into apprenticeships at Amazon with the intent to later hire them with the technical skills needed for a fulltime role.\nObsessing Over Customer Inclusion Amazon's focus on accessibility has made shopping and other daily experiences simpler for people with disabilities. From voice technology to Frustration-Free Packaging, Amazon's customer obsession for accessibility was recognized with the 2019 American Foundation for the Blind Helen Keller Achievement Award.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n66\n\fRacial Justice and Equity The inequitable and brutal treatment of Black and African Americans is unacceptable. Black lives matter and Amazon stands in solidarity with our Black employees, customers, and partners. We are committed to helping build a country and a world where everyone can live with dignity and free from fear. We support the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. We also support policies that protect and expand voting rights, as well as initiatives that provide better health and educational outcomes for Black people. As a part of that effort, Amazon and our employees--through a donation match program--were able to donate more than $27 million to organizations working to bring about social justice and improve the lives of Black and African Americans. Recipients--selected with the help of Amazon's Black Employee Network (BEN)--include groups focused on combating systemic racism through the legal system as well as those dedicated to expanding educational and economic opportunities for Black communities. BEN will also receive a grant to fund local organizations that support education and racial equity initiatives in communities across the country where our employees live and work. We plan to continue building our relationships with these organizations and supporting movements for racial equity around the world. Amazon is committed to being part of the strategies, solutions, and partnerships that will enable long-term, sustainable change.\nLGBTQIA+ Rights The rights of LGBTQIA+ people must be protected. We were early and strong supporters of marriage equality and will continue to advocate for protections and equal rights for transgender people. We stand together with the LGBTQIA+ community and are working at the U.S. federal and state levels on legislation, including supporting passage of the Equality Act. Amazon provides gender transition benefits based on the Standards of Care published by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). Amazon has held gender identity conferences since 2018 to build community, educate to those outside of the LGBTQIA+ community, and provide professional development opportunities for those at Amazon while transitioning openly in the workplace. In 2017, Amazon released our Transgender Toolkit for Trans/NB identifying employees at Amazon and we provide trans-inclusive medical benefits for Amazon employees. We are proud to have our efforts recognized, scoring 100% on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index for LGBTQIA+ rights for the last three years.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n67\n\fDiversity Conferences\nBuilding on our Leadership Principle of Learn and Be Curious, we organize conferences every year where employees can learn and exchange their ideas and experiences, several focused specifically on diversity issues:\nAmazeCon is our largest internal conference at Amazon and has highlighted the benefits of gender diversity since 2015. At AmazeCon, Amazonians examine the intersection of gender with race, sexual orientation, disability status, veteran status, and other dimensions of diversity. This conference has included talks from external leaders in technology, entrepreneurship, entertainment, and leadership. It also includes Amazon-specific programs focused on personal and team development.\nAmazeWIT is a conference we host in India bringing together women technologists, including Amazon's technical leaders and external guests. The day-long event focuses on technology deep dives (including voice technology, machine learning, Fire OS, and others) and leadership discussions from senior Amazonians and peer companies.\nConversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) is our internal conference that explores how race impacts our daily lives. Launched in 2018, the conference leads Amazonians through content on historical context, productive conversations, being an ally, and customer inclusion. At CORE, external scholars, activists, and writers dive deep on topics to educate Amazonians from all backgrounds on the experiences people of color have in the workplace, and how to create supportive and inclusive teams.\nGlobal Accessibility Awareness Month has been recognized each May at Amazon since 2015. Around the world, the month is full of events, technical talks, experiential trainings, podcasts, and workshops that showcase accessibility best practices. Amazonians take time throughout the month to learn about accessibility, even if it is not a part of their day-to-day work. In 2018, participants attended events across 13 locations in six countries. In 2018, Amazon also hosted the first A11yCon, a conference focused on increasing visibility and awareness to accessibility challenges. The conference also included a multi-location accessibility hackathon focused on finding solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing people with disabilities in today's technology-focused world.\nLearn more about our efforts to promote diversity and inclusion at Amazon.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n68\n\fEmployee Engagement\nOur more than 870,000 employees globally are the foundation of our success as a company. Consistent, honest, and open communication with our employees allows individuals to raise concerns and have them directly addressed by leadership; it allows us to continuously improve our workplace and employee experience. Our goal is to hear from and listen to everyone. Here are some of the many ways an employee can choose to communicate with management:\n\nOpen Door Philosophy We believe candid and constructive communication in an environment of mutual respect is essential to our collective success. We have an \"open door\" policy, which means we welcome and encourage any employee to discuss suggestions, concerns, or feedback with their manager, a Human Resources team member, or any member of Amazon's leadership team.\nVoice of the Associate Boards Voice of the Associate boards are in Amazon fulfillment centers around the globe--physically and virtually--providing employees a forum for expressing their concerns, offering suggestions, and asking questions on a daily basis to leadership. Leadership teams reply directly to questions, promoting dialogue and efficient remediation of issues. In 2019, our fulfillment center managers received and responded to over 225,000 comments, questions, and issues raised on the Voice of the Associates boards.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n69\n\fConnections Connections is a real-time, company-wide employee feedback mechanism designed to listen to and learn from employees at scale to improve the employee experience. Each day, Connections questions are delivered to every Amazon employee on a computer, a workstation device, or hand scanner. Employees may choose to answer or not answer any question, and individual responses are aggregated and shared with managers at the team level to maintain confidentiality. Connections analyzes response data and provides insights to managers and leaders to review and take actions as they uncover issues or see opportunities to improve.\n Connections generates over 500,000 responses from employees daily.  Connections is live in 51 countries, at over 2,500 unique sites/locations, and questions are delivered in\n21 languages.\nExecutive Escalations Suggestions or complaints sent to a member of the senior leadership team are considered \"Executive Escalations.\" Any employee can utilize this method of providing a suggestion or raising a concern to leadership. All escalations are independently reviewed by Human Resources, used as a learning opportunity, and may be used to update our processes to prevent gaps in the future.\nAppeals Process In the U.S. and Canada, the Appeals Process is a dispute resolution mechanism for employees in our in-scope lines of business (such as customer service, customer fulfillment, and sort centers) to challenge certain disciplinary actions. A second level manager, General Manager, or a panel of peers may review the issues raised in an appeal, including management decisions, to determine if a policy or practice was applied properly and consistently. If not, we will remediate the issue in line with our policies and practices.\nEthics Hotline Employees may raise questions or report suspected violations of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics through Amazon's Ethics Line in over 20 languages. Calls to the Ethics Line are answered by an independent third party and may be made anonymously upon request. Our Business Conduct and Ethics team records, reviews, and investigates calls for potential violations of the Code and tracks cases through to remediation where necessary. Allegations of violations of the Code are also reported up to the Audit Committee.\nAssociate Insight Surveys and Pulse Surveys Annual surveys ask employees to anonymously express opinions about issues in the workplace, and managers respond by remediating issues or making improvements.\nRegular In-Person Meetings Through all-hands meetings with General Managers, stand-up meetings with direct supervisors, and regular roundtables with senior leadership, employees have daily opportunities to engage with leaders, raise issues, and make suggestions to continually improve our workplace.\nFreedom of Association We respect freedom of association and our employees' right to join, form, or not to join a labor union or other lawful organization of their own selection, without fear of reprisal, intimidation, or harassment. These rights should be exercised in an informed and thoughtful manner. Amazon has associates represented by some form of collective bargaining in many countries. We value worker feedback, and are committed to providing our employees with appropriate access to grievance mechanisms and remedial action, regardless of collective bargaining presence. We firmly believe it is in our employees' and the company's best interests to continue our direct communications, and the best way to effect positive change is for our employees and us to continue working together directly.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n70\n\fSustainability Ambassadors\nAt Amazon locations around the world, more than 4,500 employees join together as Sustainability Ambassadors--a grassroots organization of Amazonians working to expand the efforts of the global teams that work directly on managing Amazon's environmental and social impacts. The Sustainability Ambassadors program started in 2017 with chapters in corporate offices and fulfillment centers in the U.S. and Europe. The program continues to expand, now with over 160 teams around the world.\nRecognizing that global challenges require global participation, Sustainability Ambassadors seek opportunities to lead and collaborate, using their collective action to amplify and deliver on Amazon's ambitious sustainability goals. Ambassadors raise awareness of sustainability as a practice for all Amazonians by delivering environmental education through on-site events. They lead projects and pilot initiatives within buildings and across communities, striving to make Amazon the most sustainable place to work.\nExamples of initiatives include: diverting products from waste into donations for people in need; developing innovations in recycling programs to include new products and locations; setting up local commute options like carpool programs and bike to work challenges; conducting energy audits with local utilities and implementing new energy efficiency programs; organizing community cleanup events at local beaches, parks, and wetlands; and developing services aimed at helping customers meet their own sustainability goals.\nAmbassadors based in our fulfillment centers and operations facilities focus on sustainability projects that help sites deliver on their carbon reduction goals. The program provides a community platform to share best practices and scale sustainability across our worldwide networks. In Poland, one Ambassador team collectively redesigned the waste segregation process in their fulfillment center, driving waste recycling rates up by over 40%.\nAmbassadors in our corporate offices have a unique opportunity to launch ideas with data-driven analysis using Amazon technology. For example, after auditing waste at our global headquarters in Seattle, Ambassadors developed a proposal to improve waste sorting using DeepLens--a deep learning enabled video camera from Amazon Web Services. A team of Amazon employees built a dataset and model that used DeepLens' object detection capabilities to identify the waste items being discarded and use built-in audio to tell people which bin to use for a given item.\nThe combination of ground-level action with scalable ideas and advanced technology makes Sustainability Ambassadors critical partners in achieving Amazon's larger sustainability goals.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n71\n\fCOVID-19\nFrom the beginning of the pandemic, we have worked tirelessly to support and protect our employees, customers, and the communities we operate in during this time of crisis. Our top concern is ensuring the health and safety of our employees, and we expect to invest approximately $4 billion on COVID-related initiatives getting products to customers and keeping employees safe.\nWe've made over 150 process updates--from enhanced cleaning and social distancing measures to new efforts like aerosol disinfectant spraying. We're spending over $85 million redeploying team members, including some of our most talented software engineers, moving them from their typical roles onto teams where they can work on cutting-edge safety programs. We distribute personal protective equipment to our employees and require them to use face coverings while at work. We introduced and scaled temperature checks across our worldwide facilities. As of May 2020, we have:\nProvided 100 million+ masks to our fulfillment center and office sites. Added 2,298 handwashing stations. Added 5,765+ janitorial staffers to our typical teams. Provided an additional 34 million gloves. Added 48 million ounces of hand sanitizer. Purchased 31,000+ thermometers and 1,115+ thermal cameras. Worked on building scalable testing for coronavirus.\nWe're continuing to innovate and find new ways to support the health and safety of our employees. One of the most promising opportunities we've discovered to improve workplace safety comes from artificial intelligence and machine learning. We are now using computer vision technologies in our buildings to help site leaders identify high traffic areas and implement additional measures to improve social distancing. This program, which we call \"Distant Assistant,\" provides immediate feedback to our employees on whether they are maintaining six-feet of physical distance from one another. As people walk past the camera, a monitor displays live video with visual overlays. Individuals remaining six feet apart are highlighted with green circles, while those who are closer together are highlighted with red circles. The on-screen indicators are designed to remind and encourage employees to maintain appropriate distance from others. We are excited to open source the software and AI behind this innovation so that anyone can create their own Distance Assistant. Individuals and businesses large and small can download the package at no cost and get up and running with just a computer and camera.\nOur colleagues are on the front lines, helping customers in communities around the world in a way very few can--delivering critical supplies directly to the doorsteps of people who need them, particularly the elderly and those with underlying health issues. Here are some of the things we are doing to support our employees:\n We gave our employees a special one-time Thank You bonus totaling over $500 million. All front-line employees and partners who were with the company throughout the month of June 2020 will receive a bonus.\n If one of our employees is diagnosed with COVID-19, they will receive up to two weeks of paid time off. This time off is in addition to their other paid and unpaid time off options.\n We established a $25 million relief fund for partners (e.g., delivery drivers) and seasonal employees facing financial hardship or quarantine.\nLearn more about how we are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic on our Day One blog.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n72\n\fSupply Chain\nAmazon is strongly committed to conducting our business in a lawful and ethical manner, including engaging with suppliers who respect\nhuman rights, provide safe and inclusive workplaces, and promote a sustainable future.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n73\n\fAbout Our Supply Chain\nOur mission is for our products to be made in a way that respects human rights and the environment. Our global teams work closely with suppliers to communicate our standards, and help suppliers build their capacity to provide working environments that are safe and respectful of human rights.\nOur Approach to Responsible Sourcing Our standards are derived from the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Core Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. To ensure our policies and programs incorporate these internationally recognized human rights standards, we conduct formal benchmarking with industry peers and multi-stakeholder organizations to continually improve our program. We regularly review our Supply Chain Standards against policies developed by industry associations (such as the Responsible Business Alliance and the Consumer Goods Forum) in consultation with external stakeholders including Nest, Business for Social Responsibility, Impactt Limited, and Verit.\nOur Sourcing Footprint Hundreds of thousands of workers, employed by suppliers around the globe, make our Amazon-branded products. The suppliers that produce Amazon-branded apparel, consumer electronics, food and beverage, and home goods products are shown on our supply chain map, which is updated regularly and is available to download. We believe supply chain transparency is crucial to our approach to human rights due diligence and ensuring worker protections. We publish our supplier list to provide customers and external stakeholders visibility into where we source and to contribute to transparency efforts across industries. When we receive information about potential issues in our supply chain we investigate and take appropriate action to remediate.\nAssessment of Risk We routinely evaluate our supply chain to understand the highest risks to workers and prioritize our efforts. To do this, we engage key internal and external stakeholders, analyze our risks using international risk indices such as the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators, run worker surveys, and conduct assessments that include worker interviews, management interviews, document review, and on-site visits. We regularly consult industry experts to review our approach to risk assessment against globally recognized international standards and industry best practices.\nSupplier Assessments Our Responsible Sourcing Program focuses on suppliers of Amazon-branded products, consisting of Amazon Private Brands and Devices and a curated selection of brands exclusively sold on Amazon. Through this program, we engage in robust supplier due diligence, prioritizing mechanisms that drive continuous improvement. We are committed to working with our suppliers to remedy issues and establish systems to prevent future issues. We expect our suppliers to consistently monitor and enforce our standards in their own operations and supply chain as well as make improvements to meet or exceed our expectations. We use independent auditors to verify supplier compliance with our standards though regular on-site inspections and confidential worker interviews.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n74\n\fIn 2019, we conducted a total of 4,082 assessments to help us determine which suppliers to work with and, for those we do engage, to help us continually understand and improve those suppliers' practices. We utilize three types of assessments:\nPre-Production Assessments Suppliers must submit an Amazon-approved assessment of their facilities before beginning production of Amazonbranded products.\n 44% of assessments conducted in 2019 were Pre-Production Assessments.\nOngoing Assessments Suppliers must submit Amazon-approved assessments on an ongoing basis while producing Amazon products.\n 35% of assessments conducted in 2019 were Ongoing Assessments of active suppliers.\nVerification Assessments Where issues are identified, suppliers must develop a corrective action plan detailing actions to address identified issues, a long-term plan to prevent reoccurrence, and where necessary, undergo a follow-up assessment to ensure issues are properly remediated.\n 21% of assessments conducted in 2019 were Verification Assessments to verify remediation.\nOur approach is based on a commitment to workers and to continuous improvement; we put the safety and interests of workers first. Suppliers are required to meaningfully participate in any investigation and take immediate action in the event that issues are found. An acceptable corrective action plan details the root cause of the issue and the steps, both short- and long-term, that supplier management will take to fix it. In most situations, we will support suppliers through the remediation process, but where a supplier refuses to remediate, we may choose to terminate the relationship. Failure to meet our standards has been a factor in our decision to terminate hundreds of suppliers.\nSupply Chain Standards and Supplier Manual\nOur mission is for our products to be made in a way that respects human rights and the environment. Our global teams work closely with suppliers to communicate our standards and help suppliers build their capacity to provide safe and respectful working environments.\nSupply Chain Standards We set a high bar for ourselves and our suppliers. Our Supply Chain Standards detail the requirements and expectations for suppliers, vendors, and service providers throughout our supply chain, and suppliers must commit to these standards as a condition of doing business with us.\nSupplier Manual Our Supplier Manual provides guidance and resources to suppliers of Amazon-branded products on how to meet and exceed the expectations outlined in our Supply Chain Standards.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n75\n\fSupplier submits\nAmazon-approved audit of facility\n\n    Key Stages of Supplier Assessment and Issue Remediation:\n\nIf issues are identified, Amazon will issue a request for\na Corrective Action Plan\n\nRemediation of identified issues is tracked through follow-on verification audits\n\nOnce in production, supplier is audited on an\nongoing basis\n\nIf supplier refuses to remediate an issue, Amazon may choose to\nterminate relationship\n\nAbout Our Assessment Results: Suppliers are assessed across four main categories: 1) Labor, 2) Health and Safety, 3) Environment, and 4) Ethics. These categories are divided into subcategories, such as non-discrimination, emergency preparedness, hazardous substances, and transparency. Findings within each subcategory are flagged as High, Medium, or Low depending on the level of severity.\nOver the last three years, Amazon has focused on setting a high bar for new suppliers and refusing to go to production until suppliers remediate all High level findings identified in our assessments. Since 2017, the proportion of audits with High and Medium level findings on Labor and Health and Safety has decreased (Labor decreased by 15.7 percentage points and Health and Safety decreased by 8.8 percentage points).\nWe recognize that some issues may take time to effectively remediate. For Medium level issues, we expect suppliers to show they are making meaningful progress toward remediation within a defined timeline. For Low level issues, we monitor suppliers for continuous improvement. We have dedicated teams based in key sourcing countries around the globe that work directly with our suppliers to identify solutions to challenging problems and promote open dialogue. We seek to create long-term relationships with suppliers who align with our values and who are committed to constantly improving conditions for workers. Where we see trends in issues beyond individual suppliers, such as widespread health and safety deficits or industry-wide failures to responsibly protect migrant workers, we work to define regional or global strategies to address underlying systemic challenges.\nThe most common High and Medium level finding in 2019 was the Wages and Benefits subcategory. Examples of findings in this subcategory are: failure to pay overtime at the appropriate overtime rate, wage payments were delayed, or required government deductions have not been properly paid. The second most common finding in 2019 was Emergency Preparedness and Response--for example, a malfunctioning fire detection system or a blocked emergency exit. We are committed to driving improvement in these areas.\n\nOur Supply Chain\n\nAcross the Globe\n\n14%\n\n1% 1%\n2% 2% 2% 2%\n5%\n\n40%\n\n15%\n\n16%\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n76\n\fProgress in 2019\nBeyond individual supplier improvements, in 2019, we invested in programs to address complex regional and systemic issues identified through assessment data, risk assessments, or by external stakeholders:\n\nAddressing Wages and Benefits: Compliance with our standards on wages and benefits persists as a common issue across suppliers in our Responsible Sourcing Program, as evidenced by the frequency of this finding among our suppliers. In 2019, we updated our Supply Chain Standards to include language encouraging suppliers to pay a fair wage and announced that worker wages is one of our key commitments areas as a program. In 2020 and 2021, we will dive deeper in to the root causes of this issue and the actions that Amazon and our suppliers need to take to reduce future findings on wages.\nWomen's Empowerment: Women have the power to be agents of change in workplaces and society. Ensuring women workers in our supply chain have the resources and information to make choices on their health, their safety, and their finances empowers them to overcome structural and societal disadvantages and improves outcomes for all workers. We have committed to investing in women's empowerment and, in 2019, we began a partnership with the BSR HERproject, an initiative that brings together global brands, their suppliers, and local partners to create and implement workplace-based interventions on health, financial inclusion, and gender equality. Through our partnership with HERproject, we engage with suppliers in China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and India. As of June 2020, we reached over 8,700 women, building the capacity of workers and factory management to combat gender-based discrimination in the workplace.\nEmphasis on Supplier Transparency: Supplier transparency issues were one of our most common High and Medium severity findings in both 2017 and 2018. Over the last year, we focused on increasing our communication with suppliers through pre-assessment outreach and on-site engagements to explain our standards and expectations of suppliers. We also improved our supplier-facing materials--including publication of a Supplier Manual--detailing our process and the importance of transparency. Building on our leadership principle of Earns Trust, we seek to build solid, trusting relationships with our suppliers over time that lead to better sharing of information.\n\nIncreased Investment in Health and Safety Programs: Health and Safety subcategories continue to be one of our most common assessment findings, particularly Emergency Preparedness and Response and Industrial Hygiene. In 2019, we began working with the International Labor Organization's SCORE Program, a lean manufacturing program focused on improving productivity and working conditions in small- and medium-sized manufacturers. We enrolled suppliers in India and China to improve supplier management systems and their ability to effectively and efficiently meet health and safety standards. The program offers training and assistance in implementing improvement plans across five areas: workplace cooperation, health and safety, quality management, clean production, and human resources. In 2020, we will continue to enroll additional suppliers and develop a monitoring and evaluation mechanism for measuring impact on health and safety performance.\nResponsible Recruitment: Forced labor is a complex and often hidden crime. Suppliers frequently lack basic awareness of the risks inherent in worker-paid recruitment fees or the importance of a process for responsibly managing migrant worker recruitment. Our standards require suppliers to reimburse in full any fees paid during the recruitment process. We are working to educate our suppliers on the issue, helping them develop the appropriate management systems, and ultimately minimizing the risks of forced labor. In 2020, we developed a Responsible Recruitment Guidebook in collaboration with labor rights nonprofit Verit. This guide provides suppliers with practical strategies to prevent forced labor risks and remediate worker-paid recruitment fees. In 2020, we will launch in-person trainings on responsible recruitment for our suppliers in Malaysia, Taiwan, and Japan. We are also working with the Responsible Labor Initiative to advance industry-wide approaches to ensuring responsible recruitment.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n77\n\fCASE STUDY\nEnhancing Worker Safety and Well-Being in the Bangladesh Garment Industry\nHealth and safety in Bangladesh factories persists as an issue, particularly in the garment industry. In 2019, we learned that products sold by third-party selling partners in the Amazon Store were potentially linked to factories with unsafe working conditions in Bangladesh. We took immediate action to remind selling partners that Amazon's Supply Chain Standards apply to all products sold on Amazon and that under those standards, Amazon expects all products sold in the Amazon Store or provided to Amazon to be manufactured or produced in safe, healthy, and inclusive work environments.\nWe issued new guidance specifically prohibiting the selling of products made in factories deemed ineligible under the Bangladesh Accord or Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which evaluates Bangladesh garment factories for workplace safety. We removed any products connected with such factories from our Amazon Store. We also notified selling partners that we will evaluate all credible allegations or reports of selling partner violations of our Supply Chain Standards, including but not limited to those published by governments, reputable investigators, journalists, or human rights defenders.\nIn addition to engaging third-party selling partners at issue in the allegations, we went further to proactively engage all suppliers manufacturing Amazon-branded products in Bangladesh. We require verification of the safety of building structures and electrical and fire safety issues, and we conduct on-site inspections with certified engineers for the highest risk issues to track closure. We enhanced our pre-sourcing screening process for new Bangladesh suppliers to ensure that adequate building safety equipment and systems are in place as a pre-condition to being approved for Amazon production.\nAs a way to further support workers in the Bangladesh garment industry, we also invested in the Amader Kotha Helpline which provides workers throughout the region, including many of Amazon's own suppliers, with a grievance mechanism to report and quickly resolve factory concerns in the ready-made garment sector in Bangladesh.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n783\n\fThe following table includes data from our assessments in 2019, including suppliers not currently producing for Amazon.\nHigh and Medium Level Findings by Subcategory in 2019 (% of all assessment findings)\n\nSubcategory Labor\nFreedom of Association Freely Chosen Employment Humane Treatment Non-Discrimination Subcontractor and Next-Tier Supplier Responsibility Wages and Benefits Worker Grievance/Complaint Mechanism Working Hours Young Workers Ethical Behavior Business Integrity Transparency Environment Hazardous Substances Pollution Management and Prevention Health and Safety Emergency Preparedness and Response Industrial Hygiene Machine Safeguarding Sanitation, Dormitory, and Canteen\n\nHigh/Medium Severity\n0.4% 3.2% 0.1% 0.4% 0.1% 40.7% 0.0% 7.9% 0.5%\n2.3% 2.9%\n0.0% 0.1%\n10.5% 9.5% 0.1% 2.3%\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n79\n\fSupply Chain Commitments\nWe evaluate our supply chain to identify the industries, countries, and issues where we have the greatest opportunities to identify and address risks and have a positive impact on workers. In the event we identify an issue in our supply chain, we act fast and prioritize solutions from the workers' point of view.\nWe work with industry partners to tackle systemic issues and implement programs that support continuous improvement for our suppliers and workers. As a part of our due diligence efforts to identify, prevent, and mitigate adverse impacts, we leverage internal and external data and guidance from external stakeholders including industry experts, civil society groups, and non-governmental organizations.\nWe are committed to assessing our impact and focusing our efforts in the following key commitment areas:\nSafe Workplaces: Safe and healthy workplaces are a top priority for Amazon. We have global teams who partner with suppliers to increase worker awareness of safety issues, promote worker participation in their facility's safety culture, and promote initiatives focused on the well-being of workers on issues that matter most to them.\nOur suppliers must provide workers with a safe and healthy work environment; suppliers must, at a minimum, comply with applicable laws regarding working conditions. Additionally, we are committed to driving improvement in these key priority areas: (1) occupational safety, including adequate machine safeguarding, and ensuring suppliers continually identify, evaluate, and control physically demanding tasks to ensure that worker health and safety is not jeopardized; (2) emergency preparedness and response planning; and (3) sanitation and housing--if suppliers provide residential facilities for their workers, they must provide clean and safe accommodations.\nWe conduct on-site assessments of Amazon-branded suppliers to determine safety conditions throughout our business relationship. This includes assessments of protections such as adequate fire safety systems, sanitary dormitories and facilities, and adequate machine safeguarding.\nWe require that these suppliers address material safety issues prior to beginning production with Amazon. Assessment results are reviewed regularly by the leadership of our Amazon-branded businesses, and corrective action plans are implemented with suppliers as needed.\nFreely Chosen Employment: We will not tolerate the use of forced labor in our supply chain. Our Supply Chain Standards prohibit all forms of forced labor and human trafficking; this includes charging workers recruitment fees, holding passports or personal documentation, and coercion to work through threats of deportation or contacting immigration authorities. During assessments of Amazon-branded suppliers, we track where workers migrated from and how much they paid in recruitment fees. If fees have been paid, we require the supplier to reimburse workers in full. Forced labor is a hidden crime that is hard to combat. We recognize real progress in this space will only be achieved through collaborative action--by companies, governments, and civil society--to spur system-wide change. Learn more about our approach to forced labor in our annual Modern Slavery Statement. Amazon is currently working with these organizations to devise holistic approaches to combating forced labor:\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n80\n\fPolaris: Amazon supports Polaris, a nonprofit that assists trafficking victims and survivors. Through the U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline, Polaris has identified and responded to over 63,000 cases of human trafficking and labor exploitation since 2007. AWS works with Polaris to infuse cutting-edge technology into its infrastructure to accelerate the development of the largest known U.S. data set on trafficking. Polaris uses that data to understand and improve the way trafficking is identified, how victims and survivors are assisted, and how to prevent this abuse.\nResponsible Labor Initiative: The Responsible Labor Initiative is a multi-industry, multi-stakeholder initiative focused on ensuring that the rights of workers vulnerable to forced labor in global supply chains are consistently respected and promoted.\nTech Against Trafficking: Tech Against Trafficking (TAT) is a coalition of technology companies collaborating with global experts to help eradicate human trafficking using technology. Amazon sits on the TAT steering committee and has leveraged the expertise and resources of AWS to help scale tech solutions in the anti-trafficking field.\nThorn: Thorn, an organization that builds technology to defend children from sexual abuse, leverages AWS architecture and machine learning tools in their product Spotlight. Spotlight's sophisticated machine learning capabilities save time for investigators by automatically flagging ads likely to represent at-risk children. Investigators can set customized alerts and search Spotlight's constantly growing database of ads to aid in their investigations. Spotlight has helped identify more than 14,000 child sex trafficking victims.\nUnseen: Amazon has made a three-year commitment to work with UK modern slavery helpline Unseen, investing in their efforts to provide immediate and long-term support to potential victims of modern slavery and to ensure the helpline's continued growth. The helpline provides direct response and services to potential victims of modern slavery, as well as trainings and programming to support those victims.\nOUR GOALS: 100% of Amazon employees who drive trucks complete Truckers Against Trafficking training by the end of 2020. Launch supplier improvement program focused on responsible recruitment by the end of 2020.\nEmpowering Women: Quality jobs for women translate to positive impacts for communities, and we are actively working to empower women to make their own decisions on health, finances, and career development. This includes collaborating with globally recognized programs such as Better Work and Business for Social Responsibility's HERproject. Through our partnership with HERproject, we engage suppliers in China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and India. As of June 2020, we had reached over 8,700 women with training on health and financial skills, building the capacity of workers and factory management to combat gender-based discrimination in the workplace.\nOUR GOAL: Launch empowerment programs to reach over 25,000 women in our supply chain by 2023.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n81\n\fFair Wages: We are committed to working closely with suppliers, business partners, and multi-stakeholder associations to monitor and promote continuous improvement in working conditions, including fair and on-time payment of wages. We have dedicated teams across the globe that work directly with suppliers to track and report performance against these standards.\nOur suppliers are required to pay legally required compensation (including overtime and benefits) and we encourage our suppliers to continuously evaluate whether workers earn enough to meet their basic needs and the needs of their family.\nWe require Amazon-branded suppliers in a number of regions to enroll in Better Work--a partnership between the International Labor Organization and the International Finance Corporation focused on improving working conditions in the garment industry and making the sector more competitive. By working with suppliers and training workers on their rights, Better Work is able to help workers improve wages over time.\nOUR GOAL: Launch in-depth research into fair wages within our Amazon-branded products supply chains in 2021.\nEnvironmental Protection: Our aim is to ensure that the manufacturing of our products does not cause unnecessary environmental harm, and positively impacts people and communities. We are a member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (Coalition), an industry-wide group of leading apparel and footwear brands, retailers, manufacturers, non-governmental organizations, academic experts, and government organizations working to reduce the environmental and social impacts of apparel products around the world. We encourage our Amazon-branded suppliers to evaluate their practices using the Coalition's Higg Index, a tool to help manufacturers measure the social and environmental performance of their facilities. We are committed to driving adoption of this assessment and helping our suppliers understand their environmental impact.\nOUR GOAL: Collect environmental performance data from 200 suppliers by the end of 2021.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n82\n\fCOVID-19\nAmazon is committed to supporting our suppliers, their workers, and their communities as they are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have dedicated over $1 million in initial investments to support response and recovery efforts in our supply chain.\nWe are continuing to monitor suppliers for compliance with our Supply Chain Standards and are making necessary modifications to supplier assessment procedures based on internal and external stakeholder recommendations. We are working to balance the need to limit the movement of people and allow suppliers time to support workers and prepare production schedules with the need to have our eyes and ears on the ground.\nWe have urged suppliers to take the following steps to mitigate risk to workers:\nFollow all government safety recommendations before resuming or continuing to manufacture Amazon-branded products and take appropriate steps to ensure safe and clean workplaces.\nAvoid ending worker contracts where workers are sick or caring for sick family members.\nEnsure monitoring of worker hours and proper overtime notices as factories ramp up production.\nWe are partnering with organizations providing critical support to suppliers and workers during this devastating pandemic:\n In Bangladesh, we've partnered with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to distribute medical supplies and COVID-19 related resources for front-line doctors, nurses, and medical workers operating in the largest refugee camp in the world. The contribution supports the procurement of lifesaving PPE for 23 IOM-managed health facilities, serving to benefit both refugee and host community populations in the region.\n Amazon is supporting the implementation of SCORE Training in 42 factories, which is helping factories plan their production schedule, reorganize production lines, and implement guidelines for more social distance and increased safety. Factories enrolled in the SCORE program receive support implementing health and safety protocols and providing workers with training on health and sanitation, which has improved the working conditions of 20,000 workers, including 9,000 women.\n As part of our longstanding relationship with BSR's HERproject, we helped to launch HERessentials, a new venture that will digitize HERproject's and Empower@Work's learning modules into a six-module Digital Worker and two-module Digital Manager Toolkit curriculum for remote access. The toolkit covers topics like personal hygiene, reproductive health and breastfeeding, and financial planning, and offers local resources on mental health and domestic violence services. The toolkit will be available to 500,000 female workers by 2025 in Bangladesh, China, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, and Vietnam, and will be translated into local languages.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n83\n\fCOVID-19\n Amazon partnered with Nest, a nonprofit building a hand-worker economy of artisans, to increase global workforce inclusivity, improve women's well-being, and preserve important cultural traditions around the world. As part of this partnership, we have been able to distribute over 100 economic relief grants to artisan businesses across the globe. We were also able to support the Nest's PPE Purchasing initiative--a program that purchased over 200,000 protective masks to be delivered to front-line workers. This program distributed over $500,000 in economic relief value to 57 businesses, which altogether employed 10,510 skilled artisans.\n We are supporting the Amader Kotha Helpline, which provides workers with a grievance mechanism to report and resolve factory concerns in the ready-made garment sector. Our contribution will help support the organization's increased call volumes and the 24/7 factory grievance lines in regions impacted by COVID-19. The Helpline serves as a resource for 600+ factories, 30 of which are Amazon suppliers, reaching 1.5 million workers in Bangladesh, and supporting them in safely transitioning back into the workplace.\n In India, we partnered with Swasti--a global nonprofit committed to ensuring access to quality healthcare for workers and those in marginalized communities--to adapt their worker well-being program (Invest4Wellness) to provide support to workers in factories impacted by COVID-19. With our support, Swasti is setting up a worker helpline, developing health protocols for workers to return to work safely, establishing an emergency response team, and providing critical mental health, healthcare, and social entitlement support to workers, their families, and their communities. These services are available to seven factories in our supply chain, reaching 3,500 workers-- including 1,400 women--and their families.\nLearn more about how we are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic on our Day One blog.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n84\n\fCommunity\nWe focus on building long-term and innovative programs that will have a lasting,\npositive impact in communities around the world.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n85\n\fAmazon in the Community\nAt Amazon, we are committed to helping children and young adults have the resources and skills they need to build their best future.

AWS InCommunities provided over 3,600 kilograms of dry ration to migrant workers housed in Mumbai.\nLearn more about how we are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic on our Day One blog.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE\n\n89\n\fGovernance\n91 Mechanisms for Prioritizing Our Work 92 Amazon Sustainability Policy Positions 94 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 95 Partnerships 103 Reporting Frameworks\n\fMechanisms for Prioritizing Our Work\nAt Amazon, we take a science-based, customer-centric approach to sustainability. We use a structured lifecycle assessment model to measure and map climaterelated risks across our value chain. We also conduct regular materiality assessments to understand the most significant environmental, social, and governance topics across our business over the short, medium, and long term.\nWe monitor risks and prioritize opportunities by taking into account customer and stakeholder expectations, voluntary practices and regulations, industry best practices, trends in financial and sustainability reporting, and emerging topics in news and social media.\nSome of our current highest priority sustainability issues are:\n Response to the COVID-19 crisis and support for our customers, employees, and communities  Climate change, energy efficiency, renewable energy, and sustainable transportation  Responsible supply chain practices, including human rights and the safety and well-being\nof workers in our supply chain  Waste, recycling, and the circular economy  Sustainable products\nAmazon uses a variety of mechanisms to embed sustainability across our business. We integrate sustainability practices into our everyday operations through goal-setting, metrics, and quarterly business reviews.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of Amazon's Board of Directors oversees Amazon's environmental, social, and corporate governance policies and initiatives, including our progress on The Climate Pledge and risks related to our operations, supply chain, and customer engagement. The Committee also oversees and monitors Amazon's policies and initiatives relating to human rights and ethical business practices.\nIn the area of climate change in particular, we are developing tools to identify and manage weather and climate-related risks across our business. The foundation of this work is the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI), a global and authoritative source for open-sourced weather, climate, and sustainability data. This data, together with AWS analytical tools, enables cutting-edge scientific work and helps us raise the bar for our customers.\nFor example, by using the NOAA weather data available in ASDI, Amazon transportation teams have been able to better predict how weather-related events (snowstorms, floods, heatwaves, etc.) impact customer package deliveries--and we have provided customers with more accurate delivery estimates as a result. The AWS Infrastructure team also leverages weather data from ASDI to better assess the impact of weather on AWS data centers. Our ultimate goal is to enable customers and suppliers to use the tools we are developing in-house to improve climate resilience.\n\nAMAZON SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE\n\n91\n\fAmazon Sustainability Policy Positions\nIncreasing the deployment of renewable energy resources is valuable for the planet, good for business, and important for our customers.

In our distribution centers, lighting accounts for up to 40% of the electricity consumption. In our pharmacies, it's approximately 5070%. With more efficient lighting, we can cut our CO2 emissions and reduce our carbon footprint. During FY19, we implemented initiatives to add LED lighting in our distribution centers, pharmacies and offices. Through these initiatives, we expect to see energy reductions of up to 40%. Our European distribution centers expect to save more than 3,300 tons of CO2 emissions per year through LED lighting alone.",

Our Scope 1 emissions increased by 25% from FY18. We believe that an important factor was a particularly cold winter in North America, which increased use of heating oil. The number of sites reporting natural gas consumption also increased. However, we saw a decrease in fuel consumption in our fleet, which we attribute to increased use of hybrid vehicles.\n Scope 2: Emissions from purchased and consumed electricity and long-distance heating consumption. Our Scope 2 emissions decreased by 3% from FY18, driven by a decrease in electricity consumption in Europe and the U.S.\n Scope 3: In FY19, we saw a substantial reduction in employee air travel, which led to an 11% reduction in CO2 emissions from FY18. These figures reflect air travel booked through our corporate travel partners.\nWe measure CO2 emissions using the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.\n\nScope 1: Fuel consumption for in-house Pharmaceutical Solutions & Services, Medical-Surgical, Canada and Europe fleets; natural gas consumption in U.S., Canada and Europe facilities; heating oil in Canada and Europe facilities\nScope 2: Electricity Consumption in U.S., Canada and Europe Facilities\nScope 3: U.S., Canada and Europe employee air travel; third-party transportation\n\nFY18 CO2 emissions\n(metric tons)\n\nFY19 CO2 emissions\n(metric tons)\n\n124,911\n\n157,076\n\n178,385 75,506\n\n173,390 67,114\n",

We strive to use our economic, environmental, social and governance resources thoughtfully and responsibly. We're a global company, and this report reflects our impact around the world as we work together for the benefit of people and our planet.\nPatients come first at McKesson. Our vision is to improve care in every setting -- one product, one partner, one patient at a time. In this report, we share how we ensure that the products we handle and distribute, as well as those we manufacture in our private-label line of business, follow applicable regulations. We also describe how we create a better experience for patients, customers and manufacturers through Six Sigma, with more than 400 projects in Fiscal 2019 alone.\nA Culture of Integrity and Operational Excellence McKesson plays a key role in helping deliver effective and efficient healthcare. But way we do business is as important as what we do. Compliance and ethics, and strong corporate governance, provide the cornerstones of our approach to corporate responsibility.\nWe are deeply concerned by the impact the opioid epidemic is having on families and communities across the U.S. We are making progress on the corporate initiatives we announced in March 2018 to help address the opioid epidemic. We have worked with outside experts to help educate customers about compliance with regulations and how to identify warning signs of prescription abuse and potential diversion. We've offered thoughtful public policy recommendations, including the Prescription Safety Alert System (RxSAS) technology proposal,\n\nand supported innovative programs and partnerships that we believe can have a meaningful impact on this challenging issue. We also contributed $100 million to the Foundation for Opioid Response Efforts (FORE), an independently governed foundation focused on combating the crisis.\nCommitted to Environmental Stewardship Using resources wisely is good for business, and it's good for the environment. We continue to focus on reducing energy use and finding alternative sources of energy. In the U.S., we signed a long-term agreement to purchase power from solar arrays, and our warehouses in Belgium have used renewable energy since our Fiscal 2017. Besides recycling and reusing resources, we also support donation programs in Canada, Europe and the U.S., so unused products and supplies reach nonprofit organizations that can benefit from them. Spending wisely has also helped to lighten our environmental impact. This past year, we saw a substantial reduction in employee air travel, which led to an 11% reduction in Scope 3 CO2 emissions from the previous year.\nSupporting Healthy Employees & Healthy Communities We're committed to healthy employees and communities. That's why we invest in programs to advance employee wellbeing and career growth. We have a culture of empowerment, recognition and belonging, and were recognized as one of the best employers for diversity.\nOur employees have a passion for creating stronger communities. In the past year, McKesson employees supported 1,183 organizations, volunteering at the workplace and in their free time. We continue to grow the bone marrow registry through our multi-year drive, which has led to six transplants\n\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\n>Table of Contents|3\n\fLetter from Brian Tyler\nto date. When emergencies strike, we stand by our customers, communities and our employees. In Fiscal 2019, we expanded our employee relief fund to Canada and introduced $1,000 grants to provide evacuation assistance to employees facing a natural disaster. During the past year alone, the Fund supported 393 employees with more than $842,000 in grants. Our work is grounded in our shared ICARE (integrity, customerfirst, accountability, respect and excellence) principles. I invite you to review this report and learn how those principles guide us in making a positive impact for patients, the environment and our society every day.\nBrian Tyler Chief Executive Officer, McKesson Corporation\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\n>Table of Contents|4\n\fOur Approach to Corporate Responsibility\n\nMcKesson Corporation (McKesson) is a global leader in healthcare supply chain management solutions, retail pharmacy, community oncology and specialty care, and healthcare information technology. We partner with pharmaceutical manufacturers, providers, pharmacies, governments and other organizations in healthcare to help provide the right medicines, medical products and healthcare services to the right patients at the right time, safely and cost effectively.\nIn FY19, we employed approximately 80,000 people, and our total revenues exceeded $214 billion. We operate primarily in the United States, Canada and Europe.\nFor McKesson, corporate responsibility (CR) means better health for our planet and people everywhere. As a company, we're working to use our economic, environmental, social and governance resources thoughtfully and responsibly. That way, we can make a positive impact on our company, our environment, and our society.\nThe cornerstones of our approach to corporate responsibility are compliance and ethics and strong corporate governance.\nCompliance and Ethics\nAt McKesson, we believe that integrity is the foundation of our culture and is critical to our long-term success. We work to inspire and enable McKesson employees to act with integrity in all we do.\nUnited by our ICARE shared principles Everything we do is driven by our shared principles, known as ICARE. These principles are a uniting force, connecting\n\nus across business units, geographies and functional areas. They shape our corporate culture. And they help us make a positive difference for patients, customers, partners, communities, shareholders and one another.\nICARE is what we expect from each other, and what the people we touch expect from McKesson.\nOur beacon: The McKesson Code of Conduct Our company operates in diverse business and regulatory environments. To ensure that all employees uphold the highest legal and ethical standards, we embed them in our Code of Conduct and require regular formal training on it.\nA shared document across our company, our Code of Conduct is based on ICARE. It describes the fundamental principles, local policies and procedures that shape our work. It covers a wide range of topics that may occur when interacting with customers, industry partners and each other. It gives helpful guidance regarding where to turn in case of questions or concerns about the right thing to do. The Code of Conduct is available in 10 languages.\nCompliance is integral to our culture Compliance is an integral part of our company and leadership culture. It refers to our obligation to laws, regulations and internal guidelines. For us, compliance is more than just following rules. It includes considering the actions we take, and adapting to new challenges and situations, always guided by our ICARE principles.\nFor our culture to be sustainable, we need to involve everyone within the company. To meet the dynamic changes in this area, we continuously review our compliance management system and self-imposed standards.\n\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\n>Table of Contents|5\n\fOur Approach to Corporate Responsibility\n\nHow we're organized Our Chief Compliance Officer is aided by a Compliance and Ethics Group as well as a designated compliance officer for each of our businesses. The Chief Compliance Officer oversees and monitors implementation of our programs, including the standards and guidelines set out by regulators. Our compliance program includes:\n Written policies and procedures\n Compliance communications and web resources\n Regulatory and compliance training\n Internal auditing and compliance monitoring\n A toll-free whistleblower hotline\n Investigations relating to compliance and ethics\n Corrective and/or preventive action, where necessary\nIn FY19, our Board of Directors formed a standing Compliance Committee, whose purpose is to assist the Board in overseeing McKesson's compliance programs and management's identification and evaluation of our principal legal and regulatory compliance risks.\nRaising concerns and seeking guidance Every employee is responsible for ensuring we comply with the laws, regulations and ethical standards affecting our business.\nOur employees raise concerns if they believe something inappropriate is happening at work. Managers have a duty to listen to employees' concerns and react to those concerns in an appropriate manner. By fostering an open environment, where all employees feel free to speak up without any fear of retaliation, we seek to advance our culture of compliance and integrity.\n\nThe McKesson whistleblower hotlines are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, in multiple languages. It allows employees to raise concerns (anonymously if they wish), including possible violations of McKesson policies or other illegal or unethical activity. We investigate all allegations, and we provide reports of allegations and investigations to senior management and the Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe hotlines are only one of the ways employees can raise concerns. We encourage employees to contact their supervisor, business unit compliance officer or the Human Resources or Legal departments with any concerns. We strictly prohibit retaliation against an employee who makes a good faith complaint through any channel. After investigating, we develop a corrective plan as needed. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors also receives reports on any allegations and investigations regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or audit matters.\nPreventing corruption We do not tolerate corruption or bribery in our business practices by our employees or by third parties working on our behalf. We don't promise, offer or give anything of value to a government official or an employee or representative of our business partners with the intent to improperly influence their conduct. Similarly, we don't receive anything of value that could be interpreted to improperly influence our conduct. We expect our business partners and third parties working on our behalf to comply with all applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and standards.\nPreventing slavery in our supply chain McKesson is committed to the highest ethical standards. To fulfill these standards, we take steps to ensure that slavery and related human trafficking do not form part of our supply chain, consistent with the UK Modern Slavery Act.\n\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\nCompliance is an integral part of our company and leadership culture. More than simply following rules, it means considering our actions and adapting to new challenges and situations, always guided by our ICARE principles.\n>Table of Contents|6\n\fOur Approach to Corporate Responsibility\n\nServing government customers As one of the largest government contractors in the U.S., McKesson is proud to partner with government customers to meet the healthcare needs of veterans, active military, children and disadvantaged groups. McKesson recognizes that our government customers face unique challenges and obligations, and we are dedicated to helping our customers suceed. Our Compliance and Ethics program is critical to the success of our government contracts.\nOur Take on Good Governance\nA balanced corporate governance approach aims to strengthen confidence in our company -- both in the capital markets and among the public -- and creates value over the long term. We know that good corporate governance advances trust among our shareholders, business partners and employees, promotes transparency in our company, and contributes to sustainable growth.\nHere's a look at our practices and processes for running our company responsibly.\nWe have an Independent Board Chair Edward Mueller, previously Lead Independent Director, took over as Independent Chair of McKesson's Board of Directors on April 1, 2019. He has been a member of the Board of Directors since April 2008 and the Lead Independent Director since July 2013.\nOur Board champions diversity and inclusion Every company should bring together diversity of thought. At the time of publication, three of our ten directors are women and two of our directors are persons of color. Since 2002, women have held three seats on our Board.\n\nAnnual evaluations keep our Board going strong Our Independent Board Chair conducts annual performance evaluations for every one of our Board members. That way, we make sure all of our leaders are committed to McKesson's values and future.\nWe plan for what's next in leadership Our Board reviews and provides input on our succession plan for developing our next generation of leaders, our CEO and executive officers. During FY19, the Board unanimously selected Brian Tyler, then president and chief operating officer of the company, to succeed John Hammergren as CEO, effective April 1, 2019. Brian is a 22-year McKesson veteran who has led nearly every major business within the company as well as McKesson's corporate strategy and business development unit.\nKey governance attributes include proxy access and the right to call a special meeting When our shareholders hold at least 3% of the company's stock for at least three years, they can nominate director candidates to fill up to 20% of available Board seats. We also allow record holders who have held at least 15% of our outstanding shares for at least one year to call a special meeting of stockholders.\nWe tell you about our political contributions and lobbying activities Transparency and accountability matter to us. In the U.S., we voluntarily disclose corporate political contributions and file reports on lobbying activities where required by law. Additionally, we provide a list of trade associations with annual payments more than $50,000. We also prohibit trade organizations from using our contributions for political purposes. In 2019, we further enhanced our political contributions and lobbying policy for the third consecutive year in response to shareholder feedback and include more prominent disclosure of our public policy approach and priorities.\n\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\nAs one of the largest government contractors in the U.S., McKesson is proud to partner with government customers to meet the healthcare needs of veterans, active military, children and disadvantaged groups.\nSince 2002, women have held three seats on our Board.\n>Table of Contents|7\n\fOur Approach to Corporate Responsibility\n\nRisk oversight is a top priority The entire Board and their committees work to understand and review our corporate risks. They oversee everything from our reputation and legal and financial reporting risk to compensation practices and cybersecurity.\nWe have a global Code of Conduct As described earlier in this report, our Code of Conduct is where we detail the policies and procedures that shape our work. It helps our entire team make ethical decisions. We've adapted and translated our code to make sure it works in every place we do.\nGuidelines help us keep up with governance Our Corporate Governance Guidelines set forth our Board's goal of building long-term value for our stockholders and are consistent with New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing requirements. Our guidelines call for the Board to monitor the performance of our company, including with respect to Environmental, Social and Governance matters, and our guidelines. They include things like:\n Director qualification standards\n Access to management and independent advisors\n Compensation\n Director orientation\n Continuing education\n Management succession\n\nOur Board members are independent Other than CEO Brian Tyler, every one of our Board members is independent, which follows the NYSE requirements and our Corporate Governance Guidelines.\nThe Board reviews our corporate responsibility practices The Board of Directors periodically reviews our company's corporate responsibility practices, including environmental sustainability, pay equity and diversity and inclusion.\nWe do more to earn trust  We do not have a poison pill.\n We eliminated supermajority voting requirements.\n We have a majority voting standard for uncontested director elections.\nIf you have any questions about McKesson's governance, let us know.\n\nWe've adapted and translated our Code of Conduct to make sure it works every place we do.\n\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\n>Table of Contents|8\n\fOur Approach to Corporate Responsibility\n\nHow We Put Together This Report\nIn FY18, we worked with our stakeholders on a materiality assessment, which is a process to identify and prioritize potential topics that could affect our company.\nThe assessment included in-depth interviews and surveys with 95 stakeholders from Canada, Europe and the U.S. They included employees, customers, suppliers, industry associations, government agencies, NGOs and joint venture partners. We involved senior leaders from multiple business units and corporate functions and sought out the perspectives of our shareholders.\nWe also brought in peer benchmarking, impact mapping, synthesis and analysis of our results. The work resulted in a materiality matrix, validated with internal leaders, and a list of prioritized topics and opportunities raised through the materiality process.\nThrough the assessment, we identified the following topics as particularly material to McKesson: product quality and patient safety; eco-efficient transport and operations; ethics and compliance; partnerships and engagement; access to healthcare and community health; and employee recruitment, engagement and retention. Based on the assessment, we developed a global corporate responsibility report that puts emphasis on the following three topics:\n1. Product quality and patient safety\n2. Eco-efficient transportation and operation\n3. Better health for employees and communities\nYou'll find a section on each as you keep reading.\n\nWhat is Corporate Responsibility?\n\nProduct Quality & Patient Safety\nManaging Risk\n Ensuring a sustainable future of healthcare  Collaborating with our partners\n\nOUR VISION\nBetter Health for All\n\nEco-Efficiency\nReducing Footprint and Cost\n Reducing our environmental footprint  Finding smart solutions\n\nBetter Health\nAdvancing Care for All\n Investing in patients, colleagues and customer success\n\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\n>Table of Contents|9\n\fOur Approach to Corporate Responsibility\nWhat you'll find here This report is a deep dive into our corporate responsibility efforts during FY19 (April 1, 2018, to March 31, 2019). We issue a report each year.\nThe report covers the good we're doing in the countries where we operate. That includes our work in Canada, Europe and the United States.\nFor more information about our operations, including joint ventures, subsidiaries, leased facilities, outsourced operations and other entities that can significantly affect comparability, please refer to the FY19 10-K, McKesson's Annual Report.\nThe Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework We've prepared our report in accordance with the \"Core\" version of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. It includes topic-specific standards that we identified through our materiality assessment. For more details, refer to the GRI content index at the end of this report.\n\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\nOur report covers the good we're doing globally, including our work in Canada, Europe, and the United States.\n\n>Table of Contents|10\n\fProduct Quality and Patient Safety Come First\n\nWe deliver one-third of prescription medicine in North America, and we serve more than 2 million customers every day across 13 European countries. It's crucial to deliver the safest products to all of these patients, because both the people making the medicine and the people taking it count on us.\nResponding to the opioid epidemic in the U.S. Each day, our distribution team delivers life-saving medicines to pharmacies, hospitals and clinics that serve millions of Americans. We take to heart that at the end of each and every item delivered -- every pill bottle, every vial, every ointment -- there is a patient in need. We know that it's not just a package, it's a patient.\nOver the past decade, as the opioid epidemic evolved rapidly, we enhanced our teams, processes and technologies dedicated to preventing diversion. We are committed to maintaining -- and continuously enhancing -- strong programs designed to detect and prevent opioid diversion within the pharmaceutical supply chain, while also protecting the availability of appropriate treatments for patients with serious illnesses and injuries.\nThis complicated, multi-faceted public health crisis must be addressed through a comprehensive and collaborative approach. Each participant in the pharmaceutical supply chain can play an important role.\nWe have advanced a series of company initiatives focused on helping to address the opioid epidemic, including launching a foundation dedicated to combating the crisis, offering thoughtful public policy recommendations -- including the Prescription Safety-Alert System (RxSAS) technology proposal -- to supporting innovative programs and partnerships that we believe can have a meaningful impact on this challenging issue.\n\nWe are committed to engaging with all who share our dedication to acting with urgency to address this epidemic and working together to end this national crisis.\nEnsuring products are safe and high quality Our quality management system is based on international procedures to ensure that products we handle and distribute, as well as the products we manufacture in our private-label line of business, follow applicable regulations.\n\nTransportation\n\nManufacturer\n\nDistribution Center\n\nCustomer/ Patient\n\nTransportation\n\nHospital/ Pharmacy\n\nMcKesson Taking Action Learn more about how we are doing our part in The Fight Against Opioid Abuse.\nOur corporate responsibility strategy focuses on how our business affects society and the environment. We look at each part of the supply chain.\n\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\n>Table of Contents|11\n\fProduct Quality and Patient Safety Come First\n Compliance: We comply with applicable laws and regulations concerning product quality in the countries where we do business. These include the Drug Supply Chain Security Act in the U.S., the Food and Drugs Act in Canada, and the Good Distribution Practice and Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines in Europe.\nThese laws and regulations commit us to keeping our products traceable, handling hazardous products appropriately and continuing to work with authorized trading partners.\n Product integrity: Our supply chain security, safety and security-training programs focus on the integrity of product packaging and containers. Here's how:\n When receiving products, we verify the quantity, supplier name and product name through the purchase order. We also make sure that the product is not set to expire soon. Our tracking system automatically lets us know if a supply is affected by a recall.\n When shipping products, we use containers that maintain quality and safety and ensure appropriate temperature control. To manage cold chain products, we use sophisticated technology for environmental controls and temperature monitoring. Refrigeration experts ensure we select shipping containers that comply with manufacturers' product specifications. When we use passive cold chain solutions, we require containers to pass a qualification process. This helps guarantee product integrity and prevent any quality issues.\n When potential incidents happen, we work to respond promptly. We follow a Corrective Action  Preventive Action (CAPA) process. To prevent counterfeit products from\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\nWe ship products in containers that ensure the integrity and quality of the drug are maintained at all times.\n\n>Table of Contents|12\n\fProduct Quality and Patient Safety Come First\n\nentering the legal distribution network, we follow a supplier qualification procedure for vendors. As part of this process, we perform regular audits and checks of authorizations and certifications.\n During product recalls, we reach out to pharmacies and other customers with details on the recall and how products can be returned to McKesson. We continuously train our customer service employees so they are up-to-date on current recalls.\n Traceability: In Europe, we follow the Falsified Medicines Directive, which requires batch tracking of certain medicinal products. When products enter the warehouse, we record the product code, expiration date and batch number. Using handheld terminals, we track the product at every stage of its journey in the warehouse -- from replenishment, to picking, to returns. If an inaccuracy occurs, the tracking system generates an alert. Our quality coordinators monitor the alerts and resolve any inconsistencies.\n Supplier requirements: Just as we hold ourselves accountable, we also hold our suppliers accountable for the quality of their products and services. In areas where we outsource distribution, this includes contracted carriers and couriers.\nIn the U.S., Canada and Europe, suppliers meet our requirements through compliance with regional, national and international legislation. For other regions, please see \"Responsible sourcing\" below.\n Manufacturer requirements: We comply with manufacturer requirements for handling and distributing products. In some cases, we have contracts with manufacturers that restrict the sale of certain medicines to certain customers, such as\n\nprison systems and others, for lethal injections. McKesson is committed to helping manufacturers implement their policies in this area. The needs and requirements of various manufacturers are different, so our contractual commitments, controls and processes vary by manufacturer. McKesson has processes and systems to enable manufacturers to validate our performance against our contractual arrangements.\nWhen we manage quality, our guide isn't only laws and regulations but also best practices and international standards. For example, 10 of our businesses in Europe are ISO 9001 certified. ISO 9001 is an international standard for quality management systems.\nResponsible sourcing We work with private-label suppliers outside the U.S., Canada and the European Union. Those suppliers must agree to McKesson Sustainable Supply Chain Principles (MSSP). The MSSP covers compliance with appropriate laws along with adherence to our strict policies on protecting workers, preparing for emergencies, identifying and managing environmental risk, and protecting the environment. These principles reflect our stance against forced and child labor, which we articulate in our response to the UK Modern Slavery Act.\nIn the U.S. and Canada, before we place the first order with a new supplier, we conduct desktop or on-site audits depending on a risk matrix analysis. These audits cover all MSSP areas. On-site audits include document review, a factory tour and interviews with workers. In either case, we document the findings and require a corrective action plan for any instances of non-compliance.\nAdherence by suppliers to MSSP is not optional. McKesson Global Procurement & Sourcing Limited (MGPSL) is stringent in regard to remediation efforts. These are made by suppliers\n\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\nWhen we manage quality, our guide is not only laws and regulations but also best practices and international standards.\n>Table of Contents|13\n\fProduct Quality and Patient Safety Come First\nwhen audits reveal any gaps in working conditions, health and safety, or environmental standards. To maintain high sustainable principles standards in factories we purchase products from, we follow up periodically on initial audits and closely monitor corrective actions.\nWhen issues are identified, McKesson auditors work with the supplier to ensure improvements are made. These audits include interviews with workers and management, inspections of production sites, and document reviews. Audit findings or non-conformances are prioritized based on risk. Should a critical issue be identified, MGPSL would require a timely response from the supplier. If a supplier failed to adequately remediate the issue, the relationships would be re-evaluated and, if necessary, terminated.\nQuality improvement through Six Sigma Across McKesson, we strive to continuously improve by using Six Sigma. Six Sigma helps us work better by using data to drive decision making and promote continuous quality improvement across our company. Using problem-solving tools, Six Sigma reduces defects and minimizes variances.\nBy improving processes, we can see fewer errors, faster cycle time and less waste.\nIn FY19, McKesson completed 405 Six Sigma projects, which had more than $160 million in cost savings and avoidance across our company, suppliers and customers.\nOne of Six Sigma's key objectives is to train, coach, and mentor employee talent, in order to deepen the operational excellence culture across McKesson. In FY19, employees in the countries covered by our centralized learning management system completed 1,269 Six Sigma training courses.\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\nSix Sigma helps us work better by using data to drive decision making and by promoting continuous quality improvement across our company.\n\n>Table of Contents|14\n\fProduct Quality and Patient Safety Come First\n\nHere are a few of our Six Sigma projects:\n Driving enhanced value through the supply chain: In FY19, the U.S. Six Sigma team completed five customer and supplier engagements that focused on the supply chain, from enhancing communication with the customers and suppliers to increasing service level metrics and improving cycle time for resolution of open items.\n Reducing paper by going digital: In 2018, a Lean Six Sigma Green Belt project paved the way into the digital future: When medicines are delivered, there is a number of documents that must be printed out and enclosed with the delivery according to fullfill official requirements. The Portuguese LSS colleagues challenged those requirements in order to make a step towards the future. The idea: Saving paper consumed by digitizing the documents. In order to get green light for this aimed change the project team closely collaborated with the Portuguese legal authorities. Although the official requirements initially insisted on the printed version, the Portuguese team was able to convince the authorities to digitize this step. This LSS initiative has a positive impact on the company's carbon footprint and was well as on the pharmacies receiving the digital documents, who now have less paper waste.\n Tracking to better control precursor returns: Precursors are products with active pharmaceutical ingredients that can be used to make illegal drugs, such as methamphetamine. As part of McKesson Canada's commitment to Health Canada, Six Sigma led a team to create an automated tracking system. It provides visibility along each step of a precursor return -- from when the product is created and shipped to the customer to when the physical return comes back into the McKesson building for processing.\n\nThese are just a few of our Six Sigma successes. Whether it's reducing defects or streamlining processes, we look forward to tackling additional projects in FY20 and beyond.\n\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\nIn FY19, McKesson completed 405 Six Sigma projects, which had more than $160 million in cost savings and avoidance across our company, suppliers and customers.\n>Table of Contents|15\n\fEco-Efficient Operations and Transportation\nCommunities thrive in a healthier environment. That's why we're sharpening our focus on environmental sustainability. Establishing new environmental best practices is a priority across McKesson businesses. We work to capture the metrics most relevant to our lines of business and act on recommendations that lead to a healthier environment. We use electricity for lighting and IT. We also use fuel for heating and transportation, including inbound and outbound distribution and business travel. We focus on efficiency across these areas. In our distribution centers and pharmacies, we focus on reducing energy use and finding alternative sources of energy. As a company focused on distribution, transportation is important to us -- in particular, fuel efficiency for our fleet.\nReducing Energy Use in Our Facilities\nAcross our locations, we work to use less energy for lighting and heating. Increasing LED lighting to lessen our footprint Our buildings use energy mainly for lighting. In our distribution centers, lighting accounts for up to 40% of the electricity consumption. In our pharmacies, it's approximately 5070%. With more efficient lighting, we can cut our CO2 emissions and reduce our carbon footprint. During FY19, we implemented initiatives to add LED lighting in our distribution centers, pharmacies and offices. Through these initiatives, we expect to see energy reductions of up to 40%. Our European distribution centers expect to save more than 3,300 tons of CO2 emissions per year through LED lighting alone.\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\nOur Sustainability Initiatives\n\n1 Increasing LED lighting across facilities\n\n2 Monitoring and benchmarking energy use\n\n3 Pursuing environmental certification\n\n4\n\nReducing movement of inventory through our redistribution center model\n\n5 Recycling and reusing resources\n\n4 5\n\n3 2\n1\n>Table of Contents|16\n\fEco-Efficient Operations and Transportation\n\nWhile we're bringing LED lighting to more than 350 pharmacies in Europe, we're also replacing inefficient heating systems with more efficient units, complete with timer controls and/or presence detectors. This initiative follows a successful pilot, where we helped 50 pharmacies save energy equal to 200 tons of CO2 emissions yearly.\nMonitoring and benchmarking energy use We use a number of tools to benchmark our energy use, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star Portfolio Manager. In many distribution centers, we also monitor energy consumption by production line, which helps us find more opportunities to conserve and cut energy use.\nBringing in renewable energy to move toward the future In our warehouses in Belgium, we switched from purchasing electricity that was generated from traditional sources to renewable energy from FY17 onward. Three of these Belgian warehouses are equipped with solar panels and generate approximately 700 MWh of clean electricity every year.\nIn the U.S., we signed a long-term agreement to purchase solar power from solar arrays. We began installing these arrays in West Sacramento, California, during FY19. We expect the agreement to reduce costs for McKesson, producing electricity equal to approximately 74% of the West Sacramento facility's annual consumption.\nWorking toward environmental certifications as we grow As part of our energy reduction strategy, we pursue environmental certification for new and newly renovated buildings. For example, our European headquarters in Stuttgart was recognized by the German Sustainable Business Council for its environmentallyfriendly design. Our U.S. offices in San Francisco, California;\n\nIrving, Texas; The Woodlands, Texas; and Richmond, Virginia are Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified, as is our distribution center in Aurora, Illinois; we are pursuing LEED certification for our Scottsdale, Arizona; Jacksonville, Florida; and Columbus, Ohio offices. We also hold WELL certification for our Irving and Richmond offices and are pursuing it in Columbus, Jacksonville and Scottsdale.\nTransportation: More Efficiency, Less Impact More output with less energy input -- this is the principle of energy efficiency. It makes perfect business sense because we save money by reducing our energy needs. At the same time, we reduce our impact on the environment by using fewer resources, which means we emit less CO2.\nTransportation in our operations We're an international business focused on distribution. For us, fuel consumption for transportation is an environmental challenge and opportunity. Our strategy focuses on optimizing delivery routes and the use of delivery vehicles. To do that, we monitor mileage and fuel consumption, and we educate our drivers on eco-efficient driving.\nEnergy reduction for outsourced fleets In areas where we outsource transportation, we take advantage of external carriers' ability to optimize schedules and avoid returning empty trucks to distribution centers. We also work with customers to adjust delivery schedules to be more efficient.\nEnergy reduction for our in-house fleet In some areas, we own our fleet. When buying new vehicles, key criteria are fuel consumption and low CO2 emissions -- while adhering to high quality standards. We teach our drivers environmentally friendly and safe practices, such as driving\n\nOur U.S. offices in San Francisco, California; Irving, Texas; The Woodlands, Texas; and Richmond, Virginia are LEED certified.\nIn our warehouses in Belgium, we switched from purchasing ordinary electricity to 100% renewable energy starting in FY17.\n\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\n>Table of Contents|17\n\fEco-Efficient Operations and Transportation\nat a safe speed limit and avoiding idling. We also adjust delivery routes and vehicle loading to cut mileage and increase efficiency. Our fleet in Canada's Quebec province has already seen the impact:  Equipment upgrades: We have a multi-year initiative to\nupgrade our line-haul tractors and 5-ton vehicles. The annual fuel reduction is approximately 95,000 liters.  Using LCVs: We use long combination vehicles (LCV) in our line-haul network in Quebec. LCVs use less fuel to carry goods, which reduces our carbon footprint. Redistribution Center model We operate National Redistribution Centers (NRDCs) in the U.S. and France. These centers help us to better manage our inventory and reduce redundancies. Even better, they help us reduce the movement of our inventory. In turn, we can save on costs and fuel within our distribution center network. Employee travel and commuting For travel to the office, we encourage employees to use sustainable options, like bikes or buses. In North America and several European countries, McKesson also offers commuter benefits, which let employees use pre-tax dollars to pay for items like subway cards or train tickets. In Canada, our Montreal office has reserved parking spaces for people who carpool. Several sites in Canada and Europe offer electric/hybrid car charging stations. While business travel is part of how we work, it also affects the environment. To reduce our impact, we encourage employees to use tele- and video-conferencing whenever possible to reduce travel and, by extension, our carbon footprint.\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\nWe're upgrading the tractors in our line-haul network in Canada. The annual fuel reduction is approximately 95,000 liters.\n\n>Table of Contents|18\n\fEco-Efficient Operations and Transportation\n\nC02 Emissions Performance in FY19\n Scope 1: Direct emissions from the consumption of natural gas, heating oil, diesel fuel and gasoline. Our Scope 1 emissions increased by 25% from FY18. We believe that an important factor was a particularly cold winter in North America, which increased use of heating oil. The number of sites reporting natural gas consumption also increased. However, we saw a decrease in fuel consumption in our fleet, which we attribute to increased use of hybrid vehicles.\n Scope 2: Emissions from purchased and consumed electricity and long-distance heating consumption. Our Scope 2 emissions decreased by 3% from FY18, driven by a decrease in electricity consumption in Europe and the U.S.\n Scope 3: In FY19, we saw a substantial reduction in employee air travel, which led to an 11% reduction in CO2 emissions from FY18. These figures reflect air travel booked through our corporate travel partners.\nWe measure CO2 emissions using the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.\n\nScope 1: Fuel consumption for in-house Pharmaceutical Solutions & Services, Medical-Surgical, Canada and Europe fleets; natural gas consumption in U.S., Canada and Europe facilities; heating oil in Canada and Europe facilities\nScope 2: Electricity Consumption in U.S., Canada and Europe Facilities\nScope 3: U.S., Canada and Europe employee air travel; third-party transportation\n\nFY18 CO2 emissions\n(metric tons)\n\nFY19 CO2 emissions\n(metric tons)\n\n124,911\n\n157,076\n\n178,385 75,506\n\n173,390 67,114\n\nConserving Resources in Our Daily Work\nWe use a variety of resources in our work. Besides power sources, we use office paper, packaging, water and materials related to distribution. We do our best to use only what we need. When we can't avoid using resources, we strive to use recycled products.\n\nUse of resources: FY18FY19* Material Recycled\n\nFY18: U.S. and Canada 15,307 tons\n\nMaterials to Landfill\n\nNot reported\n\nWater use\n\n366,786,967 liters\n\n*For all locations reporting recycling and/or water use data\n\nFY19: U.S., Canada and Europe 48,147 tons 19,129 tons 633,370,008 liters\n\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\n>Table of Contents|19\n\fEco-Efficient Operations and Transportation\n\nResource scarcity doesn't affect only McKesson. Companies that aim to stay competitive in the long term must work toward closed-loop systems and use their resources responsibly. This approach makes sense from both an economic and an ecological point of view.\nTo reduce our impact on the environment, we continuously improve the way we handle resources for our products, our services and our processes.\nTo hold ourselves accountable, we report on the total weight of materials that were recycled and went to landfill, and on water use. In FY19, we added data from Europe. This will represent our new baseline for reporting.\nReducing water use Water is a limited resource so we seek to reduce its use in our operations.\nOne way we're limiting water use is by expanding smart irrigation programs in our facilities. This system adjusts watering times based on weather conditions and lets us check our water use remotely. Users can receive notifications about changes to the settings or equipment malfunctions. Automation saves water because the irrigation system runs less often, and it is easier to identify problems. During FY19, we expanded smart irrigation programs to include five sites and saved enough water to fill 4.4 Olympic swimming pools each year.\nHazardous waste In the U.S., our Hazardous and Regulated Waste Management Program establishes standards to identify and manage hazardous and regulated waste and handle hazardous and regulated waste spills. Through the program, we make sure that accumulation and disposal of waste from McKesson facilities complies with international, national and regional regulations.\n\nWhen it comes to e-waste, we partner with certified suppliers for both leased and non-leased assets. Leased electronic assets make up the bulk of our portfolio. Upon return, most are wiped clean and reused. If they can't be reused, the parts are recycled. In Germany, we work with AfB to ensure that electronic assets are either resold or recycled. AfB is Europe's first nonprofit IT company, and it focuses on providing employment opportunities for disabled workers.\nWe also report on total hazardous waste for McKesson Europe. In FY19, we generated 1,474 tons of hazardous waste, an increase from 750 tons in FY18. We believe this increase is due to more complete reporting across business lines and represents a new baseline.\nTransport of reusable containers In many of our businesses, we send medication to customers -- including pharmacies and hospitals -- in reusable containers. After the containers are unloaded and emptied at their destination, we use them for the next delivery. Our return system guarantees a smooth pick-up process. By reusing containers, we save valuable resources and avoid unnecessary waste every day.\nGreen decommissioning When consolidating office space or moving to a new location, furniture can often go to landfill. In FY19, we partnered with a vendor that recycles, resells and donates furniture instead. To date, we have completed projects in Houston, Texas; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and San Francisco, California. In the San Francisco project alone, we diverted 90 tons of waste and donated more than $38,000 of furniture to local nonprofits. The estimated CO2 offset as of the end of FY19 was 432 tons.\n\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\nDuring FY19, smart irrigation programs expanded to five sites and saved enough water to fill 4.4 Olympic swimming pools each year.\n>Table of Contents|20\n\fEco-Efficient Operations and Transportation\n\nReducing paper use in our operations By going digital, we're using less paper. Our initiatives range from paperless invoices and two-sided printing, which will cut printing by 34 million sheets of paper, to electronic handheld scanners for packing orders in distribution centers. Our Canada distribution centers will all implement paperless paystubs by the end of FY20. When we can't avoid using paper, we encourage use of recycled stock.\nDonating unused medications and products to support patients Part of conserving resources means ensuring that unused medications and medical supplies go to people and organizations that can benefit from them.\n When people purchase medications and don't use them, valuable products can turn into trash. A group of pharmacists from Italy's LloydsFarmacia decided to do something about that. They joined forces with the City of Bologna, the regional health authority and other pharmacies to form Farmaco Amico. They invite customers to bring in unused medications that are valid for at least six more months and in unopened packages. A nonprofit partner collects and sorts the products. Then the products go to organizations serving patients without access to healthcare, in Italy and beyond. Narcotics, medications that need refrigeration, and free samples aren't included in the program. AIFA, Italy's national prescription drug agency, monitors the process.\n\n Through our partnership with World Vision, McKesson's Medical-Surgical business donated 229 pallets of supplies during FY19. These donations helped support important health initiatives in seven countries. They include programs that screen and treat young children in Somalia for malnutrition and promote better access to care for pregnant and nursing women in Zambia.\n The returns teams at several distribution centers in Canada collect returned or damaged products and arrange for them to be donated to nonprofit outreach programs. They reduce waste while supporting their local communities.\nComplying with laws and regulations Our environmental commitment begins by adhering to all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Just as we take great care in the safety and security of our products, services and people, we are careful and thoughtful to minimize the effect of our company operations on the environment.\nDuring the period covered by this report (April 1, 2018, through March 31, 2019), McKesson was in material compliance with all applicable environmental regulations.\n\nIn FY19, McKesson's Medical-Surgical business donated 229 pallets of supplies, supporting important health initiatives in seven countries.\n\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\n>Table of Contents|21\n\fCreating Better Health for Our Employees and Communities\n\nOur vision for a healthier world begins with patients and extends to our employees. We know that when our employees are healthy, not only do they enjoy their own lives more, but they help create healthier communities. As a team, we work to create healthier communities through access to care, and by giving back -- both with our money and with our time.\n\nWe build the best teams by conscientiously recruiting, developing, and retaining diverse talent. We engage and build a high performing organization to deliver unrivaled business results.\n\nOur People\nWe support healthy lifestyles for our employees and their families, and we design workplaces that are safe and secure. Beyond our facilities, a healthy workplace also means opportunities for employees to thrive and succeed.\nOur people are the key to our success. We aim to be an employer of choice and to help employees leverage their strengths. To support their growth, we provide regular feedback and training. We work to create and maintain an inclusive environment where everyone brings their authentic self to work and enjoys great employee experiences at every touchpoint.\nMcKesson's culture is one of empowerment, recognition, and belonging. It is grounded in our ICARE shared principles, which guide and unite all our employees. ICARE supports our inclusive corporate culture, where we treat others with respect and appreciate diverse identities, thoughts, backgrounds, and styles. Our culture is further brought to life through ILEAD, which is our commitment to leadership behaviors across our work and our business. These behaviors, combined with our cultural values, are what makes McKesson unique and promote a culture in which all employees feel supported and valued.\n\nMale 35%\nUnspecified <1%\nFemale 65%\n\nMcKesson by the Numbers\n\nGender\n(Companywide)\n\n>30 ~  50 Years 48%\n\nAge\n(Companywide)\n\n>50 Years 28%\n\nEthnicity\n(McKesson U.S. Employees)\n\n 30 Years 24% White 53%\nUnknown/Unspecified 4%\nPeople of Color 43%\n\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\n>Table of Contents|22\n\fCreating Better Health for Our Employees and Communities\n\nWe are proud to be recognized for our culture of inclusion. Among other achievements in FY19, we were:\n Recognized for the fourth year by the Disability Equality Index as one of the best places to work.\n Honored as one of the best places to work for LGBT equality by the Human Rights Campaign for the 6th year in a row.\n Recognized as one of the best employers for diversity by Forbes.\nWe are committed to respecting the rights of all McKesson employees. Labor laws and practices vary among the countries where we do business, and we are committed to following all applicable labor laws and regulations in those countries, including those governing labor-management relationships.\nAdvancing employee well-being We offer programs that advance the physical, mental, financial and social well-being of our employees and their families. We focus on engaging all, and we measure our success through the annual global Employee Opinion Survey.\nWe know healthcare systems are different in different countries, and our programs reflect that. For example, in Canada and the U.S., our programs include an annual health review, an interactive wellness portal and an employee assistance program. In those countries, we also provide free fitness trackers that connect to an online wellness platform, organize health challenges, and maintain a network of employee Wellness Champions. We also help employees plan for retirement, whether they're far along in their career or just starting out.\n\nOpportunities to grow McKesson wants our employees to be excited about their careers, so we invest heavily in employee growth and development. That means rewarding job assignments, one-on-one feedback from managers and opportunities for continued learning.\nWhen it comes to career development, we focus on shared goals and individualized feedback. Each goal ladders up to our overriding goal: to improve care in every setting -- one product, one partner, one patient at a time. We establish clear goals and regularly measure their achievement, and compensation increases are tied to their success. We encourage managers to provide ongoing coaching through discussions and quarterly check-in meetings. Through this process, managers provided formal feedback on 94% of eligible employees in the U.S. and Canada.\nTraining is important to career development. It helps employees succeed in their roles and prepares them for new challenges. It strengthens managers' coaching and management skills. Besides classroom training, we also offer classes through telepresence and fully online on-demand courses, so employees can learn when it fits their schedules. In FY19, our employees completed more than 290,000 hours of training (across the countries that are included in our centralized learning management platform, including Canada, the U.S., and some employees in the UK and Ireland).\nWe are always on the lookout for high-potential employees, and we have processes to help them advance. Through training, we encourage leaders to embrace diverse perspectives and lead inclusively.\n\nIn FY19, our employees completed more than 290,000 hours of training.\nWe support employees through the educational assistance program, which awarded over 1,175 tuition reimbursement grants totaling $2.1 million in FY19.\n\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\n>Table of Contents|23\n\fCreating Better Health for Our Employees and Communities\nIn North America, programs like Leaders Teaching Leaders and Women in Leadership include training, coaching and 360-degree assessments. These courses support not only the careers of future leaders, but also those of the employees in their organizations.\nWhen employees seek higher education, we support them through the educational assistance program, which awarded 1,175 tuition reimbursement grants totaling $2.1 million in FY19.\nIn Europe, we developed the START, GROW, DRIVE and EXPERT programs to promote talent and grow McKesson's international talent pool. START, GROW and DRIVE are for managers, while EXPERT supports specialists in expanding their knowledge and tackling increasingly complex challenges.\nKeeping workplaces safe and secure Patient and employee safety is the foundation for all our work at McKesson. That's why we incorporate health and safety into all parts of our operations.\nWe start by being proactive. Our Security and Safety department in the U.S. continually monitors our environment to identify potential risks, so we can prevent and mitigate them. That includes having procedures in place and investing in equipment for physical and electronic security.\nIn North America, we routinely assess all of our key facilities to make sure they follow our established security and safety standards. If we identify a vulnerability, we document it and the facility prepares a plan to address it. Across distribution facilities, we prepare a monthly Leading Safety Indicator Dashboard to measure conformance to our standards.\nIn FY19, our distribution centers in the U.S. had a 96.9% effectiveness rate in core injury-prevention programs, including joint health and safety committees, periodic self-inspections, and employee training.\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\nIn FY20, we will continue to provide a safe and secure work environment for our employees and, by extension, for the customers and patients who depend on us.\n\n>Table of Contents|24\n\fCreating Better Health for Our Employees and Communities\n\nReducing workplace injuries The first step to reducing workplace injuries is preventing them. In distribution centers, we focus on initiatives like safe lifting and pre-shift stretching. We focus on ergonomic design, as well as slip, trip and fall prevention.\nIn the U.S., injury rates (number of recordable injuries per 100 employees) improved in both distribution centers and offices during FY19. Total recordable injuries declined by 11% and losttime injuries declined by 15%. In Canada, the injury frequency rate remained the same from FY18 and the severity index declined. In FY19, we gathered safety data from Europe as a baseline, and plan to expand safety reporting to include Europe starting with our FY20 corporate responsibility report.\nTraining is the cornerstone of safety Across McKesson North America, we foster a \"working together, protecting together\" culture. Our safety training programs are for employees at all levels. Throughout their time at McKesson, employees learn to identify and control hazards they may encounter at work or at home. They also receive specialized training related to their role, environment or the equipment they use. Just as we continually update our processes, we update and add new training programs, and we train managers to coach employees on safe work practices. In FY19, U.S. employees completed over 25,000 safety training courses.\nIn FY20, we will continue to provide a safe and secure work environment for our employees and, by extension, for the customers and patients who depend on us.\n\nAccess to Healthcare\nAcross our company, we champion programs that help people access quality healthcare at a lower cost. Here are a few examples:\n Bringing online doctors to patients: In the UK, our LloydsPharmacy business offers online access to healthcare. Patients go to the website, choose a medication they would like to receive, and answer a series of questions. That information is examined by a doctor, who runs it through a sophisticated clinical algorithm that determines if it is safe to prescribe the medication. If the doctor needs to know more, he or she can send a personalized message to the patient in seconds. After the doctor approves the medication, he or she electronically signs the prescription. Patients can opt to either pick it up or have it delivered to their home. To keep the algorithms as safe and efficient as possible, they're constantly updated. Besides convenience and less wait time, this service gives patients discretion for sensitive topics, such as hair-loss treatment and sexual health.\n Bringing electronic health records to First Nations families: In Canada, Jordan's Principle is a legal rule designed to make sure First Nations families have equal access to healthcare. The Cowichan Tribes of Vancouver Island realized that without access to their own health information, it would be difficult to take an active role in their own healthcare. That's why they partnered with McKesson Canada's RelayHealth on Closing the Circle of Care. The project honors the tribes' teachings, which include working collectively for improved health. With RelayHealth, tribe members now have secure access to their health records, along with the ability to directly message their healthcare providers online.\n\nBy helping people access quality healthcare at lower cost, we help make better health possible.\nIn the U.S., McKesson's Health Mart business supports more than 5,000 pharmacies across the country, with nearly 30% located in rural communities.\n\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\n>Table of Contents|25\n\fCreating Better Health for Our Employees and Communities\n\n Caring for patients in rural settings: Rural areas often have an older population with a greater need for managing medications, yet they have less access to pharmacy services. In the U.S., McKesson's Health Mart business supports more than 5,000 pharmacies across the country, with nearly 30% located in rural communities. Health Mart is a franchise program that helps independent pharmacies compete with chain and mail-order pharmacies. McKesson helps Health Mart pharmacies get competitive reimbursement rates. Other services include branding, in-store marketing advice and peer support. Keeping rural pharmacies healthy is only part of the story. In many communities, the pharmacist is the first line of defense for patients. Yet regulations are inconsistent across U.S. states. For example, pharmacists can give vaccinations in some states but not in others. In the U.S., McKesson advocates with policymakers for consistent licensing rules across states. The goal is to make care more accessible -- and help shift it to lower-cost settings.\nCaring for Our Communities\nGiving back is a great way to build healthier communities. We provide opportunities that encourage and support employee volunteering and giving. Our programs are built to reflect our focus on better care, whether that means celebrating our Community Heroes or responding to emergencies.\nGiving back, with a focus on better health In 2019, McKesson launched and seeded with $100 million, a national, private, grantmaking foundation focused solely on advancing solutions to the opioid crisis. FORE, the Foundation for Opioid Response Efforts, works to identify actions that can be taken to stem the epidemic and drive meaningful solutions,\n\nsuch as focusing on education for patients, caregivers and providers; addressing key policy issues; and increasing access to life-saving treatments. It is overseen by a board mostly comprised of outside directors, including healthcare and subject-matter experts, to ensure FORE's work reflects diverse perspectives and approaches to addressing this epidemic.\nIn FY19, McKesson Corporation contributed $2.3 million in cash and merchandise to support a variety of charitable organizations in the U.S., Canada and Europe. The McKesson Foundation disbursed more than $3.7 million to support cancer care and employees' community engagement efforts across the U.S. and Canada.\nHere are some of the areas we focused on in FY19:\n Supporting cancer patients: In North America, the McKesson Foundation works with a network of Cancer Care Community Partners. These nonprofits are located near where our employees live and work. We support these partners through Giving Comfort, a charity program that has provided care packages to more than 76,000 cancer patients.\nEmployees create the care packages during Community Days, an annual volunteering event that drew 16,750 employees in 150 locations in FY19. By volunteering, employees also earn McKesson Foundation grants for their local Community Partner.\nThey also support the partners through McKesson in Motion, a charity wellness challenge that engaged more than 10,500 employees. During the challenge, employees completed workouts to support the fight against cancer.

They organize local events and inspire their colleagues to join our companywide volunteer programs.\nIn Europe, both our businesses and their employees showed their support for cancer nonprofits. For example, our LloydsApotek business in Sweden surveyed its employees to identify the nonprofits they most wished to support. Their top pick was Ung Cancer (Young Cancer), which provides psychosocial and community support to young cancer patients. For the past three years, LloydsApotek has made annual donations to the organization in lieu of other holiday gift-giving. In Germany, our GEHE business donates to PRIMAKLIMA, a nonprofit that organizes an annual camp to provide support and community for children fighting cancer.\n Growing the international marrow registry: In the U.S., we continue to partner with the Gift of Life Bone Marrow Registry to grow our McKesson Marrow Drive. Together, we've added more than 5,200 committed donors to the international registry. Employees register during voluntary biometric screenings, refer friends and family, and organize drives in the community. We also sponsor drives at partner universities. The registry urgently needs donors of diverse backgrounds, and we have partnered closely with McKesson's employee resource groups to help get the donors they need. As of the end of FY19, the drive has led to 26 matches and five transplants. Interest is growing across our company. In late FY19, our GEHE business in Germany started a marrow drive in partnership with DKMS, an international nonprofit. Starting at their headquarters office, it has already expanded to several of GEHE's warehouses.\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\nTogether, we've added more than 5,200 committed donors to the international registry.

In FY19, these were again close to home in the U.S., as many found themselves in the paths of Hurricanes Florence and Michael and in California, our neighbors faced massive and deadly fires.\nWhen natural disasters appear likely, we act quickly. McKesson contacts customers and first responders to encourage them to order additional inventory. We prepare our facilities for difficult conditions and stock extra medication and supplies, such as vaccines for first responders. We partner with government agencies to help our drivers access roads, so patients can receive the medications they need.\nIn addition, we support disaster relief through our Taking Care of Our Own Fund, a relief fund that supports our people when the unexpected happens. Since 2013, it has provided cash grants to employees who face hardship after sudden and severe events, including natural disasters and personal hardships. It is supported by donations from McKesson and the McKesson Foundation, as well as from employees.\nIn FY19, as part of the Taking Care of Our Own Fund, we introduced $1,000 Get You to Safety grants to provide evacuation assistance to employees. The grant money is wired within 24 hours for qualified government-declared disasters. In addition, we expanded the Fund to McKesson Canada. During the fiscal year, these grants supported more than 180 McKesson employees affected by Hurricanes Florence and Michael, as well as California fires, and floods in the Midwest and Quebec. In total, the Fund supported 393 employees with more than $842,000 in grants in FY19.\nFY19 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\nPhilanthropy Highlights\nAssisted 393 employees through the McKesson Foundation Taking Care of Our Own Fund\n$88,000 awarded in board service grants\nDonated $1 million+ through employee matching gifts program\n651 students supported and $2.8 million donated for scholarships since 1988\nAdded more than 5,200 potential donors to the international marrow registry since start of McKesson Marrow Drive\n>Table of Contents|29\n\fGRI Content Index\n\nGRI Standard/ Disclosure\n\nDescription\n\nGRI 101\n\nFoundation 2016\n\nGRI 102\n\nGeneral Disclosure 2016\n\nOrganizational Profile\n\n102-1\n\nName of the Organization\n\n102-2 102-3\n\nActivities, brands, products and services\nLocation of headquarters\n\n102-4\n\nLocation of operations\n\n102-5 102-6 102-7 102-8\n102-9 102-10\n102-11\n102-12\n\nOwnership and legal form\nMarkets served\nScale of the organization\nInformation on employees and other workers Supply chain\nSignificant changes to the organization and its supply chain Precautionary principle or approach External initiatives\n\nPage/Comment\nMcKesson Corporation, p.5 p.5\nOur headquarters are at 6555 State Highway 161, Irving, Texas, U.S. McKesson has significant operations in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Resolving to do this without taking precious resources from the planet means holding ourselves and our suppliers to ever higher standards. We know that accomplishing this work will require all of our best efforts. At Apple, we are committed to building groundbreaking products and services with the mission to leave our world better than we found it.\nIt was just a year ago that we reached our goal of covering 100 percent of our operations with 100 percent renewable electricity. That work continues as we source the clean energy needed to maintain that standard -- even as our company grows. And our learnings have paid off in significant ways as we help the manufacturers in our supply chain make the same energy transition we have. To date, more than 40 suppliers have made commitments to join us, putting us well on track to exceed our goal of putting 4 gigawatts of clean energy online by 2020.\nAt the same time, we are launching the next phase of our industry-leading work to better use and reuse materials with a state-of-the-art lab to support our research and innovation with material recovery. This initiative, along with Daisy - our fearless disassembly robot, means we're doing even more with the materials from old devices our customers return for recycling. And we've found new ways to make it easier for devices that still have value to go on to another user. Our launch of the new MacBook Air and Mac Mini with enclosures made from 100% recycled aluminum was just the beginning: Together, we're pioneering a future where we no longer need to mine precious materials from the Earth to make our products.\nAt Apple, it's simple. We apply the same level of innovation that goes into everything we create, design, power and manufacture to making things better for people and the planet. And we make it simple for customers and partners who share our passion to join us in this work. In a time where the threats facing our planet are too great to ignore, we are demonstrating that businesses must play a vital role. We are proud to do the hard work, to make the breakthroughs, and tirelessly search for ways to ensure the better future for our planet that we all deserve.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 3\n\fOur ambition: to make products without taking from the Earth.\n\nWe've embarked on a bold mission to make products without taking from the Earth.

The electricity at all of our facilities worldwide, including every Apple office, store, and data center, comes from 100 percent renewable energy--a standard we have maintained, even as we continue to grow. And we're doing even more to transition our suppliers to 100 percent renewable energy and make our products of low-carbon materials.\n\nHighlights\n\nEmissions reductions\nWe've significantly reduced our carbon emissions: by 64% since 2011 for Apple's direct operations (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and by 35% for Apple's entire footprint since it peaked in 2015.\n\nSupplier clean energy\n44 Apple suppliers have committed to power all of their Apple production with 100% renewable energy. With these pledges, we are on track to far exceed our 2020 goal to bring 4 gigawatts of new clean energy into our supply chain.\n\nComponent reductions\nIn the last year, we've reduced emissions from aluminum in our products by 45%.\n\nProduct energy efficiency\nIn 10 years, we've reduced average product energy use by 70%.4\n\n100% renewable energy\nWe're sourcing 100% renewable energy for all the electricity used at our facilities in 43 countries around the world.

That includes the emissions beyond our direct control, like those from sourcing materials, making our products, and our customers using their devices. We calculate our carbon footprint in five major areas: corporate facilities, product manufacturing, product use, product transportation, and product end-of-life processing. We use this information to tell us where to focus.\nWe prioritize use of renewable energy, starting with our own facilities. We've transitioned to 100 percent renewable energy for the electricity we use at our offices, retail stores, and data centers around the world, which has reduced facilities emissions to only 2 percent of our comprehensive carbon footprint.5 And we've extended our efforts into our supply chain, where product manufacturing represents 74 percent of overall emissions. Whether designing a product, an operating system, or a manufacturing process, we consider the environmental impact--alongside cost, durability, form, and functionality. And because the cleanest energy is the energy you never use, we're reducing energy use at facilities we operate as well as those where our suppliers make our products.\n\nOur approach to climate change\n\nRenewable energy Transition Apple and our suppliers to 100%\nrenewable energy\n\nLow-carbon design Transition product materials,\nmanufacturing processes, and operating systems to low-carbon alternatives\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\nEnergy efficiency Reduce energy use\nat corporate and supplier facilities\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 8\n\fApple's overall carbon footprint (fiscal year 2018)\nApple calculates its life cycle carbon footprint to understand where to focus reduction efforts.\n\n74% Manufacturing\n\nmaciOdlSe12\n\nother13\n\n19% Product use 5% Product transport\n2% Corporate facilities <1% End of life\n\nactimvaec 11OS\n\niOS active charge 10\n\nApple's carbon footprint\n25.2 million\nmetric tons of CO2e\n\nfinal assembly\n\nintegrated circuits6\n\nsteel\n\nelectronics9\n\ndispla\n\ny other manufacturing 8\n\naluminum\n\nboards and flexes7\n\nNote: Manufacturing, Product use, Product transport, and End of life are Scope 3 emissions.

A major contributor to the decrease was Apple's Supplier Clean Energy Program, which lowered our carbon footprint by nearly 3.6 million metric tons compared to last year. We also made several product design changes that reduced our carbon footprint, like sourcing aluminum made with hydroelectricity and recycled content, improving product energy efficiency, and redesigning integrated circuits to use less silicon. Together, these product design changes resulted in 4.8 million fewer metric tons of carbon emissions compared to last year.\nHistorically, Apple's carbon footprint has paralleled its financial performance. However, beginning in 2015, our environmental work has driven down our carbon emissions, even as revenue has increased.\n\nHistorical carbon footprint\n\n40\n\n270\n\nApple's carbon footprint (million metric tons CO2e) Annual revenue (billion $)\n\n30\n\n210\n\n20\n\n140\n\n10\n\n70\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nFiscal year\n\nApple revenue\n\nLifecycle carbon footprint\n\nEmission reductions\n\nSince 2015, Apple's emissions reduction efforts have led to a significant decline in its comprehensive carbon footprint.

Over time, we have greatly refined our model to include more Apple-specific data instead of industry averages. We made significant modeling changes in fiscal year 2016 to improve how we calculate emissions from the integrated circuits in Apple products, which resulted in a decrease in manufacturing emissions.

We stress a regional approach, with long-term energy contracts from new projects we help create. The following three principles guide this strategy:\n Local displacement. We seek to displace more-polluting forms of energy in the same electric grid region as our facilities. We accomplish this by having Apple-created projects deliver into the grid as much renewable energy as our facilities take from it. In difficult renewable energy markets where our needs are less than 0.5 percent of our total energy use, we seek a renewable energy solution in the broader geographic region.\n Materiality. We want our involvement in a renewable energy project to be a driving force to getting it built. That might mean providing needed financial support or helping the project overcome regulatory barriers. With the rapidly changing policy dynamics in some of our key countries, we're adapting our framework to continue to comply with local laws and regulations and to yield the most positive and real energy transformation.\n Accountability. We apply rigor in measuring and tracking our energy supply resources and use third-party registries such as WREGIS and NC-RETS, certification programs such as Green-e Energy, and contractual provisions to ensure that only Apple takes credit for the renewable energy it generates or procures. When no such system exists, we work with industry partners and governmental entities to create them.\nApple Park, our newest corporate headquarters, obtains about 75 percent of its power from onsite fuel cells and rooftop solar PV panels.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 11\n\f600+ MW\nOf the renewable energy projects Apple has helped create, we have direct ownership in over 600 megawatts. This is among the largest direct investments in renewable energy by a non-energy company.\n\nPowering all our facilities with 100% renewable energy.\nSince 2018, 100 percent of the electricity we've used at our facilities has come from renewable sources. To secure renewable energy projects, we've taken on project ownership, made equity investments, sparked creative new partnerships with utilities, and entered into power purchase agreements. We've also deployed a variety of technologies like wind, solar PV, micro-hydro projects, and biogas fuel cells. (See Appendix B for a comprehensive view of solutions we've implemented to secure renewable energy at our facilities.)\nWe first focus on energy efficiency to reduce the total electricity we use, then source renewables for our remaining needs. We create new renewable energy projects whenever possible. As of January 2019, approximately 66 percent of the renewable energy Apple uses comes from projects that Apple created. And we aim to soon cover our entire electricity load with Apple-created projects. We use three contracting structures to do this.\n Direct ownership. Where feasible, we source our own renewable energy by building our own projects, including solar, wind, biogas fuel cells, and low-impact hydro projects.\n Equity investment. In some markets, we invest capital to become part owner of new solar PV or wind projects and match that renewable generation with our energy use.\n Long-term renewable energy contracts. At other times, we sign long-term contracts for renewable energy in order to support new, local projects that meet our robust renewable energy sourcing principles, primarily solar PV and wind projects.\nIn cases where we need more renewable energy than what's generated by our Apple-created projects, we directly purchase renewable energy from newer projects in nearby markets, or through available utility green energy programs. When these options are not available, we are willing to procure robust renewable energy credits (RECs) tied to recently constructed projects, applying the same rigor to these purchases as we do to our Apple-created renewables. When Apple acquires RECs, we require that they are Green-e Energy certified, where available, and come from the same power grid--and preferably in the same state or country--as the Apple facility they support.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 12\n\fHow we're staying at 100%.\nTo get to--and stay at--100 percent renewable energy for the electricity at our global facilities, we've implemented new approaches to securing renewable energy: We've expanded into new markets, we're leveraging large projects to increase others' access to renewable energy, and we're investing in projects without support of government subsidies.\nNew markets.\nSince 2017, we have been procuring renewable energy in new markets that we only recently entered or in which we have small loads--like India, Turkey, Israel, Brazil, Mexico, and Taiwan-- to cover our loads in those and neighboring countries. And as we continue to grow our global operations, we'll continue building projects in new markets.\nFor example, in Taiwan we worked with a local partner to build a rooftop PV system and secured a long-term contract for Apple to own the project's renewable energy certificates. We will verify our purchase by using Taiwan's newly created T-REC tracking system.\nAggregation.\nWe're investing in large-scale renewable energy projects in the Great Lakes and mid-Atlantic regions totaling 245 megawatts of generation: an Illinois wind farm and a Virginia solar PV array. These projects will cover our electricity use at our retail stores and offices on the East Coast, as well as co-located data facilities in Chicago, Illinois, and Ashburn, Virginia. In addition, we've directly helped other companies access the same high-quality renewables that Apple is procuring. By working with others, we can help open the renewable energy market to companies of all sizes and accelerate the pace of new renewable generation.\nSubsidy-free projects.\nAs renewable energy markets around the world evolve and the technology becomes more cost-competitive, we're looking to develop projects without the government subsidies that were designed to encourage development of renewable energy. This will enable us to retain ownership of the renewable energy credits of projects we invest in. In Denmark we contracted for a new wind farm and a 42-megawatt solar PV project--one of Denmark's largest--using a commercially backed contract-for-difference power purchase agreement, the first of its kind in Denmark.\nIn China, we're working to create cost-competitive, subsidy-free renewable energy solutions for our facilities and suppliers. To encourage this transition, we supported China's voluntary REC market with the largest purchase to date, and kept our retail stores and corporate offices at 100 percent renewable in the process.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 13\n\fWe've significantly reduced our emissions.\nOur transition to renewable energy has reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 64 percent since 2011, preventing over 2.8 million metric tons of COe from entering the atmosphere. That's equivalent to taking more than 590,000 cars off the road for one year.14\n\nThe WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol defines the methodology for calculating carbon emissions.\nScope 1 emissions are those greenhouse gases resulting from fuel combustion from sources we own or operate--like vehicles or natural gas for heating.\nScope 2 emissions refer to those resulting from use of electricity. Renewable energy generates minimal Scope 2 emissions, whereas burning coal, oil, or natural gas to produce electricity releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\n\nApple's emissions since 2011 (Scopes 1 and 2)\nSince 2011, Apple has reduced emissions from our offices, data centers, retail stores, and fleet vehicles by 64 percent--even while our energy use increased by more than 3 times in this same period.\n\n800,000 600,000\n\n2.8 million\ncumulative savings\n\n400,000\n\nMetric tons CO2e\n\n200,000\n\n0 FY `11\n\nFY `12\n\nFY `13\n\nFY `14\n\nFY `15\n\nFY `16\n\nFY `17\n\nFY `18\n\nFY `19\n\nEmissions avoided: Total emissions avoided due to its use of renewable energy Apple emissions: Emissions after accounting for Apple's renewable energy program\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 14\n\f4 GW\nBy 2020, Apple and our suppliers will generate or procure at least 4 gigawatts of clean energy in our supply chain. As of April 2019, we already have commitments far exceeding our goal.\n\nLeading suppliers to switch to renewable energy.\nApple also takes responsibility for the carbon emissions that occur in our supply chain. Manufacturing makes up 74 percent of our carbon footprint. Most of those emissions come from the electricity used to make the parts in our products. So we're helping our suppliers reduce their energy use and transition to new renewable energy sources.\nWe announced Apple's Supplier Clean Energy Program in 2015, and we've seen enormous growth in just three years. In 2018, Apple and our suppliers invested in, or procured from, 1.9 gigawatts of operational clean energy that collectively generated 4.1 billion kWh. This clean energy generation avoided about 3.5 million metric tons of COe--roughly equivalent to the electricity needed to power over 600,000 homes in the U.S. for a year.14\n\nProgress toward 4 gigawatts\n\nApril 2017 April 2018 April 2019\n\nGoal: 4 GW by 2020\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nOperational (GW)\n\nCommitted (GW)\n\nTo ensure our program achieves the greatest positive impact, we have stringent social and environmental standards for supplier clean energy projects. The data above reflects only those projects that meet our strict standards and includes only clean energy generated or sourced since Apple's engagement.\n\n$300 Million\nApple recently launched the China Clean Energy Fund, a first-of-its-kind investment fund in China to connect suppliers with renewable energy sources. Initially, 10 suppliers and Apple will jointly invest nearly $300 million over the next four years.\n\nApple's role.\nApple supports supplier transitions to clean energy. We work with them to advocate for policy change in key markets. We connect suppliers with high-quality clean energy projects and developers. And we educate them on how they can take full advantage of the benefits of clean energy.\nDemonstrating leadership.\nThe transition to renewable energy can be highly complex. It often requires complicated deal structures across many regions, each with their own statutory and regulatory requirements. We gained invaluable experience by meeting our own 100 percent renewable energy goal in 43 countries, and we're using that expertise to help develop nearly 500 megawatts of solar and wind projects in China and Japan. These projects are addressing upstream emissions in our supply chain as well as demonstrating our commitment to the Supplier Clean Energy Program.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 15\n\fEducating partners.\nWe share our learnings with our supplier partners and help them plot their transition to renewable energy. In 2017, Apple developed the Clean Energy Portal, an online platform to help suppliers identify commercially viable renewable energy solutions in regions around the world. We continue to add new content, including policy guidance and financial analysis tools, intended to make adoption of clean energy in key markets even easier. Over 100 suppliers have registered for the site.\nAdvocating for strong policy.\nClean energy technology offers tremendous benefits to our suppliers, to electricity grids, and to countries. So we actively support policies that create cost-effective renewable energy markets, and we work closely with suppliers to engage local, regional, and national governments. This encourages the development of policies that support scalable renewable energy solutions.\n\n\"The Supplier Clean Energy Program is at the center of Apple's commitment to making world-class products with greener manufacturing. Our suppliers are taking significant actions to join us in this work, and we look forward to seeing more bold pledges as we continue to address our environmental impact.\"\nJeff Williams\nApple's Chief Operating Officer\n\nSupplier Progress Report\nFor more information on how our suppliers are fulfilling their renewable energy commitments, download the Program Update (PDF)\n\nSupplier progress.\nPartners across our supply chain are installing or investing in sizable solar projects and purchasing clean energy directly from renewable projects or from their utility.

The maps below represents long-term commitments to new renewable energy projects supporting 66 percent of Apple facilities, our suppliers, and cleaner grids around the world.*\nWorldwide\n\nUnited States\n\nChina\n\nRenewable energy projects\n\n  Apple Supplier\n\nUtility Clean Energy Programs\n\n  Project size\n 020 MW\n\n21100 MW\n\n101+ MW\n\nTo reduce our own electricity footprint (Scope 2 emissions), Apple currently has 28 operational renewable energy projects across nine countries on four continents, totaling 629 megawatts of generation capacity. And we have 15 more projects under construction. Once they're built, we'll have over 1.5 gigawatts of clean renewable energy generation spread across 12 countries and five continents. For some of our European loads, we procure electricity from utilities that only supply 100 percent renewable energy, and from our two renewable energy projects in Denmark.\nTo address emissions from manufacturing products, Apple and our suppliers have invested in or procured from 1.9 gigawatts of grid-connected projects, with another 3.3 gigawatts in development. These projects apply a mix of clean energy technology including wind (67 percent) and solar (23 percent).\n\n* The map does not include REC and Guarantee of Origin purchases, certain utility clean energy programs, short-term contracts, and projects that are not yet sited.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 17\n\fLow-Carbon Design\nLowering emissions through product design.\nWe design our products with great care to reduce their carbon footprint. We think about how to make them powerful while using as little energy as possible. We use materials efficiently, and we source from materials that have a low-carbon profile.\nDesigning our products to use less energy.\nEnergy efficient products not only maximize battery life, but they're better for the environment, too. We establish aggressive efficiency targets early in the design phase, and we consistently outperform ENERGY STAR, which sets the standard across commercial products in the U.S. In the last 10 years, we've decreased average product energy use by 70 percent across all Apple's major product lines.4 For example, the 11-inch iPad Pro introduced in fall 2018 is 69 percent more efficient than the ENERGY STAR standard. MacBook Air with Retina display consumes three times less power in sleep mode than the previous-generation MacBook Air. When you multiply these reductions by all the Apple devices in the world, the impact on our carbon footprint really adds up.\n69%\nThe 11-inch iPad Pro models are more than 69 percent more efficient than the ENERGY STAR standard.\n40%\niMac Pro consumes 40 percent less power during sleep and off mode--the result of an innovation in power supply design.15\n3X\nMacBook Air with Retina display consumes three times less power in sleep than the previous-generation MacBook Air.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 18\n\fLowering impact by design.\nOur carbon footprint tells us which components are carbon intensive, so we know where to focus our efforts. We reduce the amount of material we need to make certain components by changing the design and re-engineering manufacturing processes. And by sourcing from recycled or renewable materials, we can often further decrease the carbon emissions from certain components.\nIntegrated circuits, or chips, make up a large portion of our manufacturing carbon footprint. Turning a silicon wafer into an integrated circuit is an energy-intensive process. So we seek out ways to reduce the amount of silicon used in chips, while maximizing their performance. The A11 and A12 chips used in iPhone 8, X, XS, XS Max, and XR allow more processing power to be packed into smaller silicon dies, which reduced Apple's 2018 carbon footprint by 160,000 metric tons.\nThe carbon footprint of aluminum enclosures of MacBook computers has been steadily decreasing since 2015--for some products, it's over six times less. We've done this by sourcing aluminum from hydro-powered smelters, improving the material efficiency of manufacturing processes, and increasing recycled content in our products. And by using 100 percent recycled aluminum for the enclosure of the new MacBook Air with Retina display, we cut the product's carbon footprint in half.\n\nPaving the way for carbon-free aluminum smelting\n\nAluminum is a key material in many of Apple's products, and, for more than 130 years, it's been produced through a carbon-intensive process. Through a partnership with aluminum manufacturers Alcoa Corporation and Rio Tinto Aluminum, announced in May 2018, that's changing. The joint venture between Alcoa and Rio Tinto will commercialize patented technology that eliminates direct greenhouse gas emissions from the traditional smelting process, a key step in aluminum production. This is a revolutionary advancement in the manufacturing of one of the world's most widely used metals.\nAs part of Apple's commitment to reducing the environmental impact of its products through innovation, the company helped accelerate the development of this technology. And Apple has partnered with both aluminum companies, and the governments of Canada and Quebec, to collectively invest a combined $144 million to future research and development.\n\nThe world's first aluminum produced through a carbon-free smelting process.\n\n\"Apple is committed to advancing technologies that are good for the planet and help protect it for generations to come. We are proud to be part of this ambitious new project, and look forward to one day being able to use aluminum produced without direct greenhouse gas emissions in the manufacturing of our products.\"\nTim Cook\nApple's CEO\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 19\n\f8 million sq. ft.\nIn fiscal year 2018, we implemented energy efficiency measures in more than 8 million square feet of Apple facilities, with a combined annual electricity use of over 350 million kWh--resulting in an average energy savings of about 12 percent. In the past two years, we have made energy efficiency improvements to 17 million square feet.\n\nEnergy Efficiency\nThe cleanest energy is the energy you never use.\nEven as we're aggressively transitioning to renewable energy at our corporate facilities and in our supply chain, we prioritize energy efficiency. When we use less energy, we have less to procure from clean sources.\nTo increase energy efficiency at our Apple's offices, data centers, and retail stores, we start with designing buildings to optimize energy use. For existing buildings at our facilities and in our supply chain, we conduct energy efficiency audits to identify system improvements that could reduce energy use.\nA more energy efficient Apple.\nIn 2018, we have continued to expand our energy efficiency programs to data centers, retail stores, offices, and R&D facilities located around the world. This past year, we have opened new buildings on Apple campuses in Cork, Ireland; Hyderabad, India; and Shenzhen, China. Each of these buildings exemplifies Apple's commitment to energy efficiency with measures such as efficient HVAC systems with optimized air distribution, heat recovery, and radiant cooling; rooftop solar thermal; and occupancy controlled efficient lighting throughout.\nWe also implemented a program within the past year to significantly reduce the energy consumption of new retail stores worldwide. We're creating energy models during the design process to benchmark energy use and using those models to evaluate specific efficiency measures. The result is energy savings of approximately 10 to 30 percent, thanks to more thoughtful design and selection of building envelope components, lighting, and HVAC systems, as well as controlling all of these systems as efficiently as possible.\nIn fiscal year 2018, we reduced our energy use by an additional 42 million kWh and 150,000 therms--a significant increase in energy savings compared to last year, due to the expansion of our program. Combined with ongoing energy savings from past years, we are now cumulatively saving over 113 million kWh of electricity and 2.5 million therms of natural gas per year, which corresponds to avoiding 43,199 metric tons of CO2e from entering the atmosphere.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 20\n\fA more energy efficient supply chain.\nIn 2015, we started engaging directly with suppliers to help them reduce their energy use. We aim to educate them about energy efficiency, identify energy efficiency project opportunities, and manage those projects to completion. We prioritize facilities with the highest energy use and potential for improvement. Then we conduct energy audits and train suppliers to uncover opportunities for energy efficiency--like replacing outdated or inefficient heating, cooling, and lighting systems; repairing compressed air leaks; and recovering waste heat. The assessments provide suppliers with a cost-benefit analysis for implementing energy efficiency improvements.\nSince the inception of this program in 2015, we have engaged 59 suppliers at 85 facilities. In 2018, our program implemented energy efficiency measures that prevented 466,000 metric tons of COe from entering the atmosphere.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 21\n\fDaisy, Apple's line of disassembly robots, can now disassemble 15 models of iPhone, recovering more of the important materials stored inside.\n\nResources\nPutting the planet's limited materials to good use.

Whether it's materials in our products or packaging, waste generated at our own facilities and in our supply chain, or water that we use to operate our buildings, deliver services, and make products, our commitment remains the same: to protect and conserve these precious resources.\n\nOur approach to resources\n\nZero waste Eliminate waste sent to landfill at manufacturing\nfacilities as well as corporate offices, data centers, and retail stores\n\nWater stewardship Reduce freshwater use, improve the quality of water we discharge, and demonstrate leadership\nby protecting shared water resources\n\nMaterials Transition to recycled or renewable materials in our products and\nmaximize material efficiency, product longevity, and recovery\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 24\n\fWe're focusing our initial efforts on the following materials:\n\n Aluminum  Cobalt  Copper  Glass  Gold  Lithium  Paper  Plastics\n\nRare earth elements\n Steel  Tantalum  Tin  Tungsten  Zinc\n\nFor more information on how we prioritized these materials, read our paper on Material Impact Profiles (PDF)\n\nMaterials\nMore recycled material inside and out.\nSince we announced, in 2017, our ambitious goal to one day make our products using only recycled and renewable materials, we've made notable progress--especially when it comes to materials like aluminum, cobalt, tin, paper, and plastics. We make the most of materials by reducing waste and creating long-lasting products. And when our customers return products through Apple Trade In, we make sure the materials in those devices are used again and again.\nOur strategy is to create circular supply chains and reduce our impact on the planet's resources by:  Designing and building products and packaging with recycled and renewable materials,\nand using materials more efficiently.  Making long-lasting products by designing highly durable hardware, creating a broad\nnetwork of repair providers, and ensuring software compatibility with older models.  Collecting products through Apple Trade In to extend their life or recover their materials.\nHow we define a circular supply chain\n\nRenewable materials market\n\nSource\n\nContribute\n\nRecycled materials market\n\nMake\n\nUse\n\nCollect\n\nRecover\n\nCreate and\n\nprotect\n\nCreating a circular supply chain Reaching our goal means focusing on three key aspects of our supply chain: 1) Source strategically and make efficiently: Use recycled and renewable materials while manufacturing\nproducts efficiently to minimize use of materials. 2) Use for a long time: Design products to be durable, so they can have long lives. 3) Contribute: Ensure materials go back into the market for Apple or others to use.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 25\n\fSupplier responsibility\nWe hold ourselves and our suppliers to the highest standards when it comes to human rights, environmental protection, and health and safety practices in our supply chain--including for sourcing of materials. Learn more >\n\nSourcing recycled and renewable materials.\nWe aim to end our reliance on mining. That's why we are transitioning to recycled16 and renewable materials, and maximizing material efficiency, all while maintaining the exceptional quality and finish of our final products.\nWith such a broad ambition, we needed a robust, data-driven way to determine where to start. So we assessed 45 elements and raw materials based on their environmental, social, and supply impacts. The resulting Material Impact Profiles helped us identify a short list of materials on which to focus first. And we continue to use these profiles to determine which materials to tackle next.\nEach material requires a different solution. For some, like rare earth elements, recycled material is not widely available. So simply understanding the barriers to recovery requires significant exploration, and the learning represents meaningful progress. For other materials, like tin, recycled material markets are more robust. So we piloted uses of recycled tin in select applications and brought them to scale. Throughout these explorations and across many materials, we've deepened our relationships with downstream recyclers. And we've partnered with suppliers further upstream to use fewer materials and find alternative, recycled sources.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 26\n\fAluminum\nTo use 100 percent recycled aluminum, we had to invent a whole new kind. Standard recycled aluminum accumulates impurities each time it's recycled. So we engineered an alloy that can accommodate scrap sources of aluminum and delivers the same strength, durability, and flawless finish. We use sophisticated computational models to identify an alloy chemistry that can withstand a countless number of recycling loops. Our own products and processes are a valuable source of aluminum scrap for our custom alloy, including iPhone enclosures recovered by Daisy. In fall 2018, we introduced MacBook Air and Mac mini models with 100 percent recycled aluminum enclosures. And use of recycled materials helped cut the carbon footprint of each product nearly in half. In 2019, these efforts will allow us to avoid mining more than 900,000 metric tons of aluminum-bearing bauxite.\nCobalt17\nWe use cobalt primarily in batteries. A limited supply of recycled cobalt is available on the market for use in batteries like ours, not because recyclers lack the ability to recover cobalt, but because many recyclers don't have enough scrap sources, like batteries. So we set out to find new sources of scrap for our recyclers, starting with our own supply chain. We began sending iPhone batteries recovered from Daisy, Apple's iPhone disassembly robot, to our upstream recycler in Apple's battery supply chain. And after a successful pilot program, select battery and final assembly suppliers now send Apple's battery scrap to our recycler upstream. Recycled cobalt from both scrap sources is being recycled into the batteries of new Apple products--a true circular supply chain.\nCopper\nAs a highly conductive metal, copper is used to make our printed circuit boards, cables, and connectors. We're engaging with our suppliers to investigate new methods to manufacture our printed circuit boards in a way that uses less copper. For the copper we do use, we are moving to recycled sources. We are currently certifying the recycled copper content in the printed circuit boards of select iPhone models and estimate that the recycled copper used for these products represents over 60,000 metric tons of mined ore. To increase our contribution to recycled material streams, Daisy now liberates seven different components from which copper can be recovered, including the main logic board and the camera. And we're directing these components to recyclers and smelters that can recover copper at high rates.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 27\n\fGlass\nFor glass, we're focused on material efficiency and recovery. We're working with our cover glass suppliers to ensure that all glass scrap generated during the manufacturing process is recycled at the highest level possible. Glass is incredibly sensitive to impurities and changes in composition--even the production of new devices introduces impurities--so maintaining the quality is essential for recycling glass.\nGold18\nGold is already recovered at high rates due to its value. We're continuing to identify ways to reduce the amount of gold we use in the plating of components like our printed circuit boards. In iPhone XS, for example, gold represents less than 0.01 percent of the overall product mass. We're working within the complex gold supply chain in order to increase the use of certified recycled gold.\nPaper\nWe've successfully created a closed-loop, circular supply chain for paper. For the second year in a row, 100 percent of the wood fiber in our packaging was either from recycled sources or from responsibly managed forests or controlled wood sources. And to ensure we're not taking away from the world's supply of responsibly sourced paper, for the third year in a row, we are protecting or creating enough sustainably managed forests to cover all the wood fiber we use in our packaging.\nPlastics\nWe've first focused on using less plastic through material efficiency. For example, we re-designed the way plastic was injected into the mold of a high-volume part in iPhone XS and iPhone XR, cutting the scrap produced by one-third. For the plastic we do use, we're looking for renewable or recycled alternatives to fossil fuel-based plastics. However, we use vast numbers of distinct grades of plastic, each designed to meet specific requirements. We are systematically exploring and qualifying recycled and renewable alternatives for each grade, so that whatever type of plastic a product needs, we will have a recycled or renewable option. So far, we've identified recycled alternatives for 24 different grades of plastic, allowing us to use an average of 38 percent recycled plastic across 82 components for products released this year. In our packaging, we're working to eliminate the need for plastics altogether, and we have reduced plastic in our product packaging almost by half in three years.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 28\n\fRare earth elements\nElements like neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium are used in magnets for audio applications, in cameras, and in haptics technology. Traditional recyclers don't recover these rare earth elements, because they are used in small quantities and technology has not advanced sufficiently to recover them. However, Daisy recovers the small components that contain rare earth elements from iPhone. By consolidating these sources, we're creating an opportunity for new technology to efficiently recover these materials.\nSteel\nOur primary use of stainless steel is in the enclosure of iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, and in some Apple Watch models. We're working with our suppliers to increase and certify the recycled content in the stainless steel we source. And we've updated Daisy to recover the steel from iPhone enclosures and bands, which we then send to recyclers who are able to recover this highly recyclable material.\nTin18\nA market supply of recycled tin exists, but we need to make sure it meets our quality standards. In 2017, we proved we could use 100 percent recycled tin for the solder on the main logic board--where the majority of tin is found--of iPhone 6s. We're now specifying 100 percent recycled tin for the solder of the main logic boards of seven subsequent iPhone models plus the newly released MacBook Air with Retina display, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Using recycled tin in Apple devices will prevent us from mining almost 29,000 metric tons of tin ore in 2019. But we want to recover as much tin as we're using--and make sure the tin is recycled and put back into the world's supply. Unfortunately, tin is not recovered by all electronics recyclers. So we're prioritizing recyclers that recover tin, in addition to copper and precious metals, from the main logic boards and camera modules retrieved by Daisy.\nTungsten18\nTraditional recyclers shred products to quickly break them down. Though shredding makes separation easier, it can cause the recycler to lose many materials, like tungsten. That's why we designed Daisy as an alternative to whole unit shredding. Daisy is able to separate out the Taptic Engine, which we send to speciality recyclers that recover tungsten from it. We're also working with our suppliers to certify the use of recycled tungsten in our products.\nLithium, tantalum,18 and zinc\nAs we've advanced in our work to create circular supply chains, we've expanded our program to include other materials in our products, using the Material Impact Profiles to guide us. We recently added lithium, tantalum, and zinc. And we've already begun exploring new recycled sources and prioritizing recyclers that can recover these key materials.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 29\n\fiPhone XS meets the IP68 international standard for dust and water resistance.

So we design our products with durable materials, support them with ongoing OS updates, and make them easy to get repaired if anything happens. Because the longer a device is in use, the better use we make of the Earth's resources.\nDurable by design.\nWe design our products for durability. For example, we built iPhone XS to meet the IP68 international standard for dust and water resistance, which means the devices can withstand being submerged to a depth of 2 meters for up to 30 minutes. And we prove that recycled and renewable materials can also meet our standards. For example, the solder in the main logic board of iPhone is made with 100 percent recycled tin that performs every bit as well as newly mined tin.\nIn our Reliability Testing Lab, we amplify real-world conditions to enhance the durability of our designs. We test your device's ability to withstand mechanical stresses, such as a sudden impact with a hard surface. In climate tests, we pit our devices against extreme heat and cold, dry and humid conditions, and intense sun exposure. Our chemical sensitivity tests evaluate the ability of devices to stand up to accidental spills like coffee, soda, sunscreen, or ketchup. We often go beyond international standards, and sometimes even create our own.\nWith these tests, we intentionally push our products beyond their limits so we can study what happens. We then use state-of-the-art equipment, such as CT scanners and electron microscopes, to thoroughly understand impacts to the microstructure. This information flows back to our designers and engineers to enable further durability improvements. We repeat this cycle through our product development process until our products meet our rigorous performance standards.\niOS updates your older device with new capabilities.\niOS has the best software update mechanism in the industry, bringing updates to more devices than anyone else. We provide this support so customers and developers alike can take advantage of the latest features, privacy and security updates, and other key improvements-- enabling our customers to use devices longer.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 30\n\fRepair locations\n\niOS 12 was released in 2018 but is optimized for devices as far back as 2013, the largest base of support ever for an iOS release. It makes devices faster and more responsive; for example, iOS 12 enables an up to 70 percent faster camera swipe, up to 50 percent faster keyboard display, and up to two times faster app launch on the iPhone 6 Plus.19 And many past generations of iPhone or iPad can take advantage of the latest features like Group FaceTime and Screen Time. Out of all devices using iOS--including those released many years ago--80 percent are using iOS 12.\nBetter use of materials through repair.\nWhen devices are repaired rather than replaced, we make better use of the materials in them. And we know even the most dependable products sometimes need service. That's why we offer a network of more than 5,000 Apple Store locations and Apple Authorized Service Providers worldwide to provide safe, high-quality repairs. We offer battery replacement for all of our products--and we make sure the replaced batteries are recycled responsibly. Customers can access these repair locations in person or by mail. And we are continuing to expand our services.\nTo make sure that repairs are performed safely, securely, and to the highest quality, we continuously train and certify service channel personnel, with over 265,000 active trained personnel. Our providers perform diagnostics and calibrations to target repairs precisely, avoiding unnecessary service and replacements of parts. When new parts are needed, only genuine Apple parts are used, so repaired devices work exactly the way they should. And all Apple-certified repairs are backed by Apple.\nWe continue to expand access to high-quality and convenient repair options for our customers. Our new method for optimizing iPhone screen repairs has allowed thousands more independent shops to start offering this repair service.\nWe offer a network of more than 5,000 retail stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers worldwide to repair devices so that they can be used longer.\n\n  Apple Authorized Service Providers Retail stores\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 31\n\fApple Trade In\nTrade in your device for credit toward a new one, or recycle it responsibly for free.\nWe work closely with our recycling partners to help make sure:  Privacy is protected.  Devices are recycled safely and\nresponsibly.  Applicable regulations are followed. See how it works >\nIn spring 2019, we are launching a program with Best Buy in the U.S. and KPN in the Netherlands so that eligible iPhones will be sent to our disassembly robot Daisy.\n\nTrade it in. Help the planet out.\nEven when you're done with your device, chances are it still has more to give to the world. Apple Trade In is a simple way to exchange your old device for credit so that it can be reused by a new owner. If it isn't eligible for credit, we'll recycle it free of charge.20 Either way, your trade-in helps reduce the amount of materials that need to be mined from the Earth. That's a trade-off that works for everybody.\nRefurbishing for a new life.\nOur devices are built to last. That's why they often go on to a second or even third user. Through Apple Trade In, customers in 27 countries can trade in their devices either online or in-store. For products that still have more to give, customers can receive an Apple Store Gift Card or a refund on their purchase. These devices are repaired when necessary and sent to their next owner. If a product is at the end of its life, we'll recycle it for free. We also collect and refurbish used devices through our iPhone Upgrade Program, AppleCare, and, inside Apple, our Hardware Reuse Program for employees. Altogether, we directed 7,860,000 devices to new users in fiscal year 2018. Keeping these devices in use rather than needing to make new products to serve those customers resulted in tangible material and carbon emissions savings.\nRecycling for material recovery.\nAfter sourcing responsibly and creating long-lasting products, we focus next on recovering materials. We participate in and offer product collection and recycling programs in 99 percent of the countries in which we sell products.21 These programs recycle our products and other electronics, all for free. In fiscal year 2018, we helped divert more than 48,000 metric tons of electronic waste from landfills. And we continue to make these programs more accessible.\nTo truly end our reliance on mining, we also need to better capture the materials inside the products we recover. We created our disassembly robot, Daisy, to remove and sort components, so we can recover more materials at a higher quality than traditional recyclers can. This year, we updated Daisy to disassemble six additional iPhone models--15 models in total--from iPhone 5 to iPhone XS. Even while identifying models in real-time and disassembling devices with greater variation, Daisy can take apart 200 iPhone devices per hour. In the U.S. and the Netherlands, Daisy is now processing end-of-life iPhone models returned to us through Apple Trade In and AppleCare.\nSome of the recovered materials are already heading back into our supply chain for new products. Most of the aluminum recovered from iPhone, for example, became part of the 100 percent recycled aluminum enclosure of MacBook Air. And cobalt we recovered from the iPhone battery is used to make new Apple batteries. Because of our efforts to keep harmful substances out of our products, these materials are safer to recover and reuse.\nFor some materials, however, efficient recycling technologies don't exist. We don't believe technology should be a barrier to conserving the Earth's resources. That's why we created our new Material Recovery Lab in Texas. The lab will focus on three key areas: optimizing existing recycling practices, improving the ability to disassemble devices, and advancing research and development of the next generation of recycling technologies. We aim to benefit the broader recycling industry through this research. After all, the more material that gets reused, the less that needs to be mined from the Earth.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 32\n\fComponents and materials Daisy recovers\nMain Logic Board Tin Gold Copper Silver\nReceiver Steel Copper Rare earth elements\n\nTaptic Engine Tungsten Rare earth elements Steel Copper\n\nWireless Charging Coil Gold Copper\n\nFor every 100,000 iPhone devices, Daisy has the potential to recover:*\n\nAluminum Gold Silver Rare earth elements Tungsten Copper Tin Cobalt Steel\n\n1,500 kg 1.1 kg 6.3 kg 32 kg 83 kg 1,000 kg 29 kg 790 kg 1,400 kg\n\nNew Enclosures (iPhone 8 and later)** Aluminum Copper Steel\n\nOld Enclosures (iPhone 7 and earlier) Aluminum Steel\n\nBattery Cobalt\n\nSpeaker Steel Copper Rare earth elements\n\nDock Flex Tin Gold Copper\n\nRear Camera Copper Tin Gold Rare earth elements\n\nFront Camera and Face ID Copper Tin Gold Steel\n\n* These quantities are based on an estimated product mix for what Daisy is likely to disassemble in the upcoming year, reflecting additional iPhone models.

The results are more beautiful than ever--for our packaging and for the planet.\nCutting down on plastic.\nIn three years, we've reduced our plastic use in U.S. product packaging by 48 percent. Starting with iPhone 7 and iPad Pro, we changed the plastic tray in the packaging to an all molded fiber alternative. This switch allowed us to also create iPhone XS and XR, iMac Pro, MacBook Air, iPad mini, and iPad Pro with majority-fiber packaging. And as of March 2019, we've transitioned to 100 percent fiber retail bags in all retail stores. These new bags even have a knitted paper handle and contain 80 percent recycled fiber.\nUsing recycled and responsible sources.\nWe aim to maximize the use of recycled paper in our packaging. In fiscal year 2018 we used 58 percent recycled paper, on average. When virgin paper is needed, we require our suppliers to source wood fiber from responsibly managed forests or Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) controlled wood sources.22 For the second year in a row, all of our packaging suppliers sourced their paper responsibly. And we conduct regular audits to ensure their claims.\nOutside of packaging, less than 1 percent of our total fiber use is for our corporate offices--of which approximately 85 percent came from recycled or responsible sources in 2018.\n\nPackaging fiber and plastic footprint* (metric tons)\n\n37,000 21%\n\n34,000 21%\n\n24,000 14%\n\n19,000 10%\n\n2015 171,500\n\n2016 165,000\n\n53,000 31%\n\n81,500 48%\n\n50,000 30%\n\n81,000 49%\n\nPlastic\n\nRecycled fiber**\n\nVirgin fiber**\n\n* The packaging fiber and plastic footprint includes retail and shipping boxes. ** Beginning in FY18, we considered bagasse to be virgin fiber, instead of recycled fiber.\n\n2017 169,000\n\n51,000 30%\n\n94,000 56%\n\n2018 187,000\n\n60,000 32%\n\n108,000 58%\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 34\n\fOur journey to responsible packaging\n\nProtecting responsibly managed forests.\nWe don't just specify that all of our virgin fiber be sourced responsibly, we also want to make sure we're not diminishing the world's supply of responsible paper. For the third consecutive year, production from the responsibly managed forests we've protected or helped to improve exceeded the amount of virgin fiber we used in our product packaging.23\nOne year early, we achieved our 2020 goal of transitioning one million acres of forest across China to improved management. This is part of our five-year partnership with World Wildlife Fund, which is focused on three primary objectives:\n Increase responsible management of working forests in China--by creating up to 375,000 acres of FSC-certified forests. And improve the management of up to 640,000 acres.\n Contribute to the improvement of China's policy framework to encourage responsible forest management.\n Help China establish long-term market incentives for responsibly sourced paper.\nIn addition to improving the management of 1 million acres of forest directly, the project has the potential to influence millions more by supporting the development of the China Sustainable Plantation Management Guidelines. These guidelines, informed by our project and released by China's National Forestry and Grassland Administration, have been selected by the national government for use in the National Reserve Forest Plan, which guides the management of more than 40 million acres of forest.\nIn the U.S., we continue to partner with The Conservation Fund (TCF) and support its innovative Working Forest Fund model. Through this fund, TCF purchases threatened working forests, protects them into the future through conservation easements, then sells the protected forest to begin the process again. So far, we've protected 36,000 acres of forest in the Eastern United States that are now certified as sustainably managed. And when forests thrive, so do local communities and wildlife.\n\n48%\nreduction in plastic use\nin 2018, compared to 2015\n\n58%\naverage recycled wood\nfiber content\n\n100%\nof wood fiber in our packaging\ncomes from responsibly managed\nforests\n\n100%\nWe are protecting or creating enough responsibly managed forests to cover all of the virgin paper we use in our packaging\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 35\n\fZero Waste\nFinding new ways to keep old materials out of landfills.\nWe're working to reuse, recycle, compost, or when necessary, convert into energy all the waste created by our own facilities and in our supply chain. Reaching this goal requires collaboration among multiple Apple teams, local governments, and specialty recyclers, and we've already seen great success.\nA zero waste program for Apple facilities.\nWe're currently pursuing an ambitious goal of Zero Waste to Landfill at our more than 450 corporate facilities, our more than 500 retail stores, and our five data centers.24 Our first aim is to reduce the waste we generate by rethinking the materials we use--in areas from building renovations to food service. And for the waste we do create, we're working to recover it to its highest and best use through robust composting, recycling, and reuse programs.\nIn fiscal year 2018, we generated 74,000 metric tons of waste and diverted about 74 percent from landfill through recycling and composting, up 3 percentage points from fiscal year 2017. To reduce the waste we generate, we work with our upstream vendors to streamline materials used and select those designed with the environment in mind. For example, we set up new packaging standards for all of our data centers, eliminating unnecessary packaging and finding ways to reuse the packaging shipped. When we do create waste, we focus on managing it responsibly. In renovations across our hundreds of corporate facilities, nearly 85 percent of the furniture is recovered, repaired, and made available for reuse. And because lack of data is one of the biggest obstacles to managing waste well, we installed remote monitoring systems that allow us to identify problem areas and resolve them quickly and accurately.\nAcross facilities that generate hazardous waste, Apple takes great strides to ensure it is managed responsibly. We complete regular audits of the Transportation, Storage, and Disposal Facilities (TSDFs) where hazardous waste is ultimately sent to be treated, recycled, or incinerated. Only facilities we audit are allowed to accept and treat the hazardous waste Apple generates. We take this commitment seriously--if any TSDF does not meet our strict standards for environment, health, safety, and waste management protocols, we send waste to an alternate, approved facility.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 36\n\f1 million metric tons\nThrough our supplier Zero Waste Program, we've diverted enough waste to cover more than 4,000 soccer fields 1 meter deep.\n\nA zero waste program for our suppliers.\nIn 2015, we launched a Zero Waste Program for suppliers, which provides them with onsite support to recycle and reuse materials. The aim is to divert 100 percent of waste from landfills. We provide tools and guidance, including the services of experts in sustainable waste management.\nInitially we prioritized suppliers with the most significant waste impact: final assembly facilities where components from all over the world come together to be assembled into Apple products. Our goal was to help these facilities drastically reduce the waste they send to landfill. And in 2018, we achieved UL's Zero Waste to Landfill certification for all final assembly facilities across iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, AirPods, and HomePod.25 This includes the Appleoperated final assembly site in Cork, Ireland, which was the first Apple facility to receive the designation from UL.\nWe've since expanded our efforts further upstream in our supply chain to include sub-assembly suppliers. However, the deeper we go, the more complex the waste streams become. So we are looking for new technological innovations, exploring up-cycling techniques to reuse by-products, and even reassessing manufacturing processes.\nIn 2018, we diverted 375,000 metric tons of waste from landfills. And to date, we've engaged 90 suppliers and diverted more than 1 million metric tons of waste--enough to cover more than 4,000 soccer fields a meter deep.\nWater Stewardship\nProtecting Earth's most precious resource.\nWater supports all life on Earth. And while water itself is plentiful, only a small fraction is available to those who need it. The scarcity of freshwater continues to increase, a trend exacerbated by climate change. So we hold ourselves accountable for the water we use, whether at our corporate offices, data centers, distribution centers, and retail stores, or at our suppliers' facilities around the globe.\nHow we're tackling our water footprint.\nWater is necessary to operate our corporate facilities, including for cooling at our data centers. At our manufacturing facilities, suppliers use water for processes like etching, cutting, cleaning, and cooling. So we work to conserve it and be smarter about the water we do use. We focus both on improving water use in our facilities and--through our Clean Water Program--helping our suppliers conserve water and prevent water pollution. And we are engaging communities where we operate and manufacture products to make sure shared water resources are protected and accessible. We're proud of the progress we've made, but we know there's still work to do.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 37\n\fWe mapped our global water use to different levels of water risk. As a result, we're focused on three locations with elevated water risk--Maiden, North Carolina; Mesa, Arizona; and Santa Clara Valley, California--where 52 percent of our total use occurs.\n\nTo continue to improve our water use by our facilities and our suppliers, we focus on:\n Using water efficiently to reduce overall use.  Identifying alternative water sources, such as recycled and reclaimed water.  Discharging water responsibly to prevent pollution.  Expanding our water stewardship to keep watersheds healthy for all who rely on them.\nWater resources are extremely local. That's why we focus on areas where our efforts can have the largest positive impact. We map our global water use against water quality, quantity, and regulatory factors to understand which regions have an elevated risk. We then prioritize those locations based on how much water we`re using. We continually update our risk assessment based on new data and better understanding of the regional environments in which we are operating. And when engaging with suppliers, we put a special emphasis on working with those with high water usage, the potential for poor discharge quality, and facilities in waterstressed regions. Working with suppliers is key, as early assessments show that manufacturing represents the majority of our water footprint.26\nUsing water efficiently.\nWater is essential to the work we do. However, we aim to minimize the water used by our facilities and our suppliers' operations, especially in areas of elevated water risk. And by continuing to expand our reduction efforts, we aim to improve our footprint over time.\nIn fiscal year 2018, Apple used about 1.26 billion gallons of water directly, a 26 percent increase over the previous year. This increase was driven largely by growth in a few locations, and by increased visibility into temporary water use. These temporary uses accounted for 140 million gallons of water in 2018, and include things like dust control for new construction and the establishment of mature, drought-tolerant trees in landscaping.\nWater use at Apple facilities We track our corporate water use for our data centers, retail stores, and corporate offices.\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n0\n\n300\n\n600\n\n900\n\n1200\n\n1500\n\nMillions of gallons\n\nFreshwater use\n\nRecycled water use\n\nTemporary freshwater use\n\nBeginning in fiscal year 2017, our boundary expanded to include more than 150 million gallons of water used annually at distribution centers and co-located data centers.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 38\n\f5X\nincrease in total water savings from the Clean Water Program in two years\n\nOur water footprint shows us that we need to continue to reduce our water demand. This year, a number of different water efficiency efforts helped minimize our freshwater use. We designed our latest data centers buildings in Maiden, North Carolina; Reno, Nevada; Viborg, Denmark; and China to use 80 percent less water for cooling than at previous data centers. In our retail stores, our newly launched back-of-store, or \"backstage,\" design includes low-flow fixtures that save up to 30 percent more water compared with our previous design. And at our corporate offices in Santa Clara Valley, our landscape efficiency program continues to reduce our outdoor water use--by more than 15.3 million gallons per year--through turf replacement and irrigation system upgrades. Around the world, our pursuit of water efficient design is expected to save more than 90 million gallons of water per year.\nThrough our supplier Clean Water Program, we help those who make our products improve their water use by performing baseline assessments, providing technical support on watersaving improvements, and monitoring progress. Our suppliers conserved 7.6 billion gallons of water across 116 facilities in 2018, bringing the total cumulative savings to 21 billion gallons since 2013. These savings were achieved through diverse initiatives including installation of low-flow fixtures, use of meters to control consumption, and employee education. And since many of our suppliers also build components for other companies, we're reducing the water footprint of non-Apple products, too.\nFinding alternative sources.\nAs we work to minimize our overall water use, we also look to alternative sources to help reduce freshwater withdrawals, including recycled water, reclaimed water, and harvested rainwater.\nAcross our facilities, use of recycled water worldwide grew from 24 million gallons to 63 million gallons in fiscal year 2018. This reflects recycled water use in two of our three largest co-located data centers as well as offices in Elk Grove, Singapore, and India. We have also made significant investments to bring recycled water to our campuses in Santa Clara Valley, an effort that will replace over 30 million gallons of potable freshwater a year.\nCaptured rainwater represents another alternative source of water for our facilities. In 2018, we captured and reused 4 million gallons of rainwater for cooling, irrigation, and construction needs at our Maiden, North Carolina, data center, and at our corporate offices in Cork, Ireland, and Yokohama, Japan. And our newest retail location, Apple Champs-lyses, features a rainwater collection system which can collect up to 1,800 gallons of water a day. This system will reduce potable freshwater use by 15 percent per year at the store.\nWhen we engage suppliers, we also focus on ways to reclaim and reuse water. We look for creative sources of water to reclaim, including condensation from centralized air conditioning. For water reuse, even simple solutions can be highly impactful. For example, we encourage the re-use of the water used to wash products in-between production stages. As they are rinsed, products are moved from tub to tub of water, and as they do so, both the device and water gets cleaner. Simply moving rinse water in the opposite direction of the devices as it gets dirtier, rather than dumping it, allows the same rinse water to be reused two to three times. With solutions both simple and complex, we've increased the average water reuse to 39 percent across suppliers.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 39\n\fWater Treatment Manager at a Clean Water Program facility for packaging manufacturing, China.\n\nDischarging water responsibly.\nManaging wastewater discharge is also an important way to conserve water resources in a watershed.\nAt our Santa Clara Valley campus, we're implementing an onsite wastewater treatment system that will treat approximately 550,000 gallons per year of water onsite and return it to the municipal wastewater system. And at our data centers in Prineville, Oregon, and Reno, Nevada, our teams have been deploying a mineral filter media that allows us to recapture more of the water we use in cooling, reducing water discharge by up to 30 percent.\nOur Supplier Code of Conduct includes standards for wastewater discharge quality, and we regularly audit for compliance with these high standards. Our Clean Water Program engagement goes beyond compliance to help our suppliers build world-class water management systems. We target supplier sites based on water discharge risk and launch intensive, multi-year engagements. We begin with a comprehensive assessment that leads to targeted improvements, including installation of improved infrastructure, use of cutting-edge wastewater treatment technologies, and the creation of systems for validating discharge. Throughout the program, we engage deeply to create cultural change and promote greater water literacy.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 40\n\fPursuing water stewardship.\nWater connects communities. It's also essential for human health and thriving ecosystems. So we look beyond our own operations to restore water resources in critical regions and ensure that local communities have water access.\nIn Prineville, Oregon, we created a water supply solution to meet the needs of Apple's local data center and the broader community for years to come. We partnered with the City of Prineville to build an aquifer storage and recovery system, which uses natural underground spaces to costeffectively store water throughout the year for use in peak demand months. With a storage capacity of up to 180 million gallons--significantly more than we use for our data center--the system also helps mitigate future climate-related risks of water shortages.\nApple and our suppliers have also partnered with the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS), a collaboration between businesses and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), in a program to support water management beyond the factory and into the community. We've launched a pilot project with five suppliers in the Kunshan region of China, an area with a cluster of electronics suppliers that is experiencing water-quality challenges. These five suppliers aim to meet the AWS global standards, which promote effective water management and safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) for local communities. Already, two Apple suppliers have received AWS certification, including the first Gold certification ever to be awarded in the electronics industry. And we plan to expand our supplier stewardship program to improve water quality at other sites like the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 41\n\fApple Champs-lyses is expected to receive a BREEAM \"Very Good\" green building rating. Environmental features include energy efficient lighting, a rainwater collection system, and responsibly sourced materials.\n\nChampioning green building design\n12 million sq. ft.\nWe are constructing and certifying more than 12 million square feet of green building space worldwide.\n\nBuildings are the embodiment of our commitment to conserve water and energy, reduce waste, and use renewable energy. We actively apply green building principles to all of our offices, data centers, and retail stores around the world.\nWherever possible, we pursue green building certifications like U.S. Green Building Council's LEED certification and the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM). Apple Park, our new headquarters in Cupertino, is on track to be the largest LEED Platinum-certified office building in North America. When we constructed our Hollyhill building at our campus in Cork, it was one of only six in Ireland to be awarded an \"Excellent\" rating by BREEAM. And our data center in Viborg, Denmark, is LEED Gold certified--as are buildings at our data centers in Reno, Nevada; Maiden, North Carolina; Mesa, Arizona; and Prineville, Oregon.\nAt our retail stores, we also apply green building principles to reduce our demand on the environment, while providing healthier spaces for our customers to experience our products. When we renovated a historic building on the Avenue des Champs-lyses for our new retail location, we installed environmental features like high-efficiency lighting systems, rainwater collection, and onsite PV panels, which are expected to earn the building a rating of \"Very Good\" from BREEAM. Our newly launched back-of-store design for retail locations reduces energy load by 40 percent and is made of recycled materials, including insulation made with 80 percent post-consumer recycled denim. More than 50 stores have already been built with this design. We have also committed to sourcing only Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified materials for all tables, benches, and wood fixtures in all new retail stores--nearly 150 locations and hundreds of tables in 2018 alone. FSC only certifies wood made from forests that protect water resources, promote biodiversity, and enhance the lives of workers and local communities.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 42\n\fSince 2017, 100 percent of supplier assembly sites have adopted safer cleaners and degreasers with our help.\n\nSmarter Chemistry\nMaking products as safe as they are sound.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 43\n\fSmarter Chemistry\n\n45\n\nOur Approach\n\n46\n\nMapping and Engagement\n\n46\n\nAssessment and Management\n\n48\n\nChemistry Innovation\n\nMaterials are what make products faster, tougher, and more beautiful.

Our approach begins with collecting comprehensive chemical composition information for the substances used to make our products as well as the process chemicals, like cleaners and degreasers, suppliers apply when making our products. We use this information to evaluate supplier compliance with the Apple Regulated Substances Specification (RSS)--our own set of global chemicals restrictions that goes beyond regulatory requirements and is based on best industry practices or toxicology properties. We go even further by using the chemical composition information we've collected in order to assess the hazard and risk of unregulated substances. And if we ever identify a substance that needs replacement, we innovate with our suppliers to find safer alternatives.\n\nOur approach to smarter chemistry\n\nMapping and engagement Create a comprehensive inventory of chemicals used by suppliers to make our products\n\nAssessment and management\nAssess and manage chemicals for risks to\nhuman health and environment\n\nInnovation Transition to safer chemistries through chemical innovations, beyond what is required\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 45\n\fGRE\n\nE N\n\nENSCRE\nWe screen our materials with comprehensive risk assessment tools, including GreenScreen, which evaluates substances against 18 different hazards, including carcinogens, mutagens, and endocrine disruptors.\n\nMapping and Engagement\nWe're exhaustively mapping materials in our products.\nEvaluating the chemicals in the tens of thousands of components used in our products is an enormous task, but it's essential to our commitment to customer safety. It starts with creating an extensive inventory of chemicals used to make them. That means collecting information not just from our suppliers, but from their suppliers, too. We're working closely with our partners to construct a detailed map of every chemical inside our materials, including many of the chemicals used to manufacture them.\nWe go beyond what's required by law to eliminate harmful chemicals from our products. In 2016, we launched the Full Material Disclosure (FMD) program, an ambitious initiative aimed at helping us more comprehensively understand the chemical composition of every substance in every part of our products. This can be challenging because it requires that suppliers disclose proprietary information. We overcome this by storing the data securely and limiting access to a select number of people within Apple who are responsible for toxicological assessments. We prioritize materials with the greatest risks, such as those used in high quantities or those with the greatest human exposure. We collect detailed chemical information for tens of thousands of components and over 75 percent of product mass for new iPhone, iPad, and Mac products. We won't stop until we rigorously understand the chemistry of every material.\nIn 2015, we went a step further by creating an inventory of chemicals that are used at supplier facilities but don't reside in the products. We mapped the process chemicals used in our final assembly facilities and evaluated all control measures such as ventilation, personal protective equipment, and worker training programs. The mapping resulted in the further identification-- and continued replacement--of potentially harmful substances that required controls and personal protective equipment from cleaners at final assembly sites.\nAssessment and Management\nWe evaluate chemicals for risks to your health, and the planet's.\nIn 2002, we introduced the RSS, which identifies the harmful chemicals we limit or prohibit in our manufacturing processes and products. In 2006, we built our own Environmental Testing Lab, where our chemists look for any potentially harmful substances and test products to evaluate compliance with the RSS. Since the lab's opening, we have expanded it to more than 30 times its original size and have regularly updated it with state-of-the-art equipment--like an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, liquid and gas chromatography mass spectrometers, and a laser-induced breakdown spectrometer similar to the one used by NASA. We even manufacture artificial sweat to simulate human exposure and evaluate the safety of our materials that come into contact with skin.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 46\n\fAt Apple's onsite environmental testing lab, chemists assess products for harmful chemicals.\n\nWith information collected from the environmental testing laboratory, and the FMD and chemical mapping programs, we can then generate comprehensive toxicology assessments. This includes GreenScreen, which considers 18 criteria to help us understand the materials' effects on people's health and the environment. We also have inhouse, board-certified toxicologists who use lab testing and computer modeling to create toxicological profiles that previously didn't exist--addressing a major challenge in this field. Only materials that pass our rigorous review process are accepted for our products.\nWe're just as committed to the safety of the people who make our products. We require our suppliers to follow the standards set in our RSS. In 2014, we launched our Chemical Management Program to help suppliers develop a comprehensive approach to managing chemicals safely. The program, which has grown to 113 participating supplier facilities, enables our partners to shift to safer chemicals and improve general safety, awareness, and training. And to help drive toward safer chemicals, we map chemicals use and screen them using GreenScreen to assess the safety of cleaners and degreasers used at supplier final assembly facilities.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 47\n\f100%\nSince 2015, 100 percent of the process chemicals used at our supplier final assembly facilities complied with Apple's Regulated Substances Specification.\n\nChemistry Innovation\nInventing ways to replace bad substances with good ones.\nWe're continually evaluating the materials used in our products and design to avoid harmful substances altogether. We seek to reduce and remove toxins, by developing new, safer chemistries. When there is not an existing alternative to a chemical we've determined harmful, we innovate. We work with our suppliers to develop custom chemistries made with safer substances. To find a replacement for PVC and phthalates, for example, we and our suppliers invested in four years of research and development to create power cords and headphone cables that had both the performance and chemistry that met Apple standards.27 This deep commitment to innovating on safer chemistries sets Apple apart from many others who still use PVC and phthalates in their cables.\nWe began to identify and phase out harmful substances in the late 1990s, beginning with PVC in our packaging, and moving on to the lead that was in our display glass and solder.28 Since then, we've also replaced mercury displays with energy efficient and mercury-free LEDs and OLEDs; eliminated arsenic from display glass;29 replaced brominated flame retardants from thousands of parts such as enclosures, cables, circuit boards, and connectors, using safer metal hydroxides and phosphorus compounds in their place;30 and eliminated beryllium-copper connectors and springs from all new product designs.\nWe're also focused on replacing harmful substances in manufacturing process chemicals to keep workers in our supply chain safe. We have long been engaging with our manufacturing partners to ensure safe working conditions. After analyzing the chemical composition of cleaners and degreasers used at supplier final assembly sites, we chose to go a step further and replace all identified hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives such as ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, glycerol, and water. In our first year of this Safer Cleaner Substitution program, we helped 18 sites replace 24 problematic formulations.31 In addition, in 2018, we added n-Propyl Bromide (nPB) to our RSS list of banned process chemicals for cleaning and degreasing. These efforts seek to avoid use of harmful chemicals, which protects the people who make, use, and recycle our products and keeps pollutants out of the land, air, and water.\nWe removed PVC and phthalates from all our power cords, headphones, and cables.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 48\n\fA timeline of smarter chemistry\nOur program initially moved beyond a strictly compliance focus in the late 1990s, when we started to phase out PVC from our packaging.

And listening.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 50\n\fBetter Together\nThe challenges we're tackling--like powering a global business with 100 percent renewable energy, or making products using only recycled or renewable materials--are too big for any one company to solve alone. So we listen. We speak. We convene. We advocate. We lead. We learn. And we engage at all levels: locally, nationally, and internationally; and with policymakers, researchers, non-governmental organizations, other companies, and our customers. Every conversation, every meeting, and every presentation brings us closer to unlocking more environmental innovations that we--and others--can apply. Because bold ideas and creative solutions can emerge anywhere, from anyone, at any time.\nMore partnerships. More progress.\nWe work with a wide range of nonprofit, industry, government, and business partners from across the globe. We've built strong relationships with a broad group of stakeholders, including those who might disagree with our approach. We do this because we believe that addressing their concerns often leads to better solutions. Exposing ourselves to varied perspectives helps us challenge our assumptions and refine our methods. That's critical when you're pursuing a vision that's as bold and complex as ours: to one day make products without taking from the Earth.\nJoining industry associations allows us to work closely with some of the best companies across all sectors. Our memberships in organizations like the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), World Economic Forum's Platform for Accelerating Circular Economy, Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Aluminum Stewardship Initiative, Ceres, Corporate Eco Forum, the Chinese Association of Circular Economy, Digital Europe--and most recently, the Japan Climate Leaders Partnership--provide us the opportunity to exchange ideas with those who share our commitment to a more sustainable future.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 51\n\fLisa Jackson speaks at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union about the role of the private sector in spurring smart, innovative environmental action. At Apple, we believe that telling the story of our vision and our progress can inspire others to join our efforts.\n\nCollaborating for joint success.\nWe've continued to work with cross-sector companies, researchers, suppliers, technical experts, and customers to forge new paths, build unique solutions, and inspire others to continue their efforts.\nAcademic partnerships.\nWe are building relationships with key academic institutions worldwide--like Tsinghua University's School of Economics and Management in Beijing, where we are funding a $3 million endowed chair professorship based on Responsible Innovation. We also collaborated with Tsinghua University's School of Public Policy and Management on its Summer Institute for China's Green Innovators (SICGI) program. In the past three years, 112 students from 50 universities joined the program to identify creative policy solutions to environmental challenges through course training and internships with local environment agencies.\nTo support our Smarter Chemistry work, in 2015, we formed a Green Chemistry Advisory Board, made up of some of the world's leading toxicologists, researchers, and academics. The board helps us explore innovative ways to minimize or eliminate toxins from our supply chain and to incorporate the latest breakthroughs in green chemistry into our products and processes.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 52\n\fCustomer engagement.\nWe seek to engage customers in our environmental mission, giving them opportunities to join in our efforts. In the past three years, we have launched two customer-facing campaigns: Apps for Earth; and communications around the benefits of returning devices to Apple for trade-in or recycling.\nApps for Earth was a 2016 partnership with app developers and customers that generated over $8 million to support World Wildlife Fund's global environmental projects. As of November 2018, World Wildlife Fund has fully invested the funds raised in conservation projects spanning all seven continents. These projects have helped protect wildlife through improved tracking, increase access to freshwater in vulnerable communities, promote sustainable food production and consumption, improve community management of forests, use technology to advance ocean conservation, and build resilience in ecosystems threatened by climate change.\nFor every device received through Apple Trade In during a two-week period around Earth Day 2018, Apple made a donation to Conservation International. We then partnered with the nonprofit to use the funds to protect and restore a 27,000-acre mangrove forest in Colombia, which is expected to sequester 1 million metric tons of CO2 over the project's lifetime. These mangroves not only protect the coasts and help support the livelihood of those communities where they grow, they can also store up to 10 times more carbon than forests on land. This is because mangroves store significant amounts of \"blue\" carbon in the soil below the water line, in addition to storing carbon in their roots, leaves, and branches like other trees. Our project with Conservation International was the first to fully value the entire ecosystem-- trees and soil--for its climate mitigation value. We hope this effort will encourage the protection of threatened mangrove ecosystems globally as important resources in the fight against climate change.\nWe also donated to the SEE Foundation in China with funds raised from the Earth Day campaign. With this contribution, SEE Foundation supported 20 grassroots NGOs in China focused on enhancing waste management and pollution control. SEE also facilitated crossindustry collaboration such as introducing Zero Waste concepts to the outdoor sports industry.\nStakeholder roundtables.\nOver the past several years, we have invited key stakeholders to participate in roundtables in Europe, the United States, and China to obtain feedback on Apple's key environmental programs, like our work on Smarter Chemistry and our ambition to create a circular supply chain for the materials in our products. Attendees at these roundtables have included a range of academics, NGOs, industry leaders, and other companies. Since these meetings, we have collaborated with subject-matter experts, think tanks, NGOs, and consulting firms to support our work.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 53\n\fSpeaking up for stronger climate policies.\nClimate change is one of the greatest threats facing our planet. Clean energy technology offers tremendous benefits to our suppliers, electricity grids, and communities around the world. We believe that if policymakers fully and properly value these benefits, clean energy becomes more cost-competitive than fossil fuel energy. Market and policy design is not one-size-fits-all, so we work closely with our suppliers and local experts to find the best solution for each country. For the past four years, we have been advocating for strong climate policies that promote decarbonizing our economy and support procurement of renewable energy.\n\nJuly 2015 (U.S.): Apple joined the White House's American Business Act on Climate Pledge, in which participating companies voiced support for a strong outcome at the COP21 in Paris and demonstrated an ongoing commitment to climate action.\nApril 2016 (U.S.): Apple joined Google, Microsoft, and Amazon to sign an amicus brief in support of the U.S. EPA's Clean Power Plan\nJune 2016 (World): Lisa Jackson addressed 700 senior government, business, and community leaders at the seventh Clean Energy Ministerial, where she called for governments across the world to put a price on carbon to address climate change.\nApril 2017 (Japan): Apple joined nine other companies, including Fujitsu, Ikea, Microsoft, Patagonia, and Sony to formally encourage the Japanese government to promote corporate renewable energy use.\nJune 2017 (China): Apple spoke at the eighth Clean Energy Ministerial in China to highlight our commitment to climate change, particularly our partnership with suppliers to reduce carbon emissions from manufacturing.\nJune 2017 (U.S.): Apple urged the White House to remain in the Paris climate agreement and take meaningful action on climate change\nAugust 2017 (China): Apple met with central and provincial-level policymakers across China to advocate for corporations to be able to purchase directly from renewable energy power plants.\nNovember 2017 (China): Apple hosted a roundtable with the Green Electricity Consumption Cooperative Organization (GECCO) to create a platform for buyers in China to discuss renewable energy procurement challenges and opportunities, and inform future policy.\nNovember 2017 (Vietnam): Apple joined a number of other companies urging the government of Vietnam to make regulatory changes allowing companies to procure renewable energy through direct power purchase agreements.\n\nMarch 2019 (Kenya): Apple participated in the UN Environmental Assembly and conducted bilateral discussions with a number of countries to advocate for policies that enable a circular economy and bold action on climate.\nJanuary 2019 (Vietnam): Apple met with government officials to discuss benefits of electricity market reform, including allowing businesses to purchase power directly from renewable power plants.\nDecember 2018 (China): Apple provided feedback and insights on its approach to renewables procurement in China in support of a publication developed to help the broader corporate community identify renewable energy solutions.\nOctober 2018 (Japan): Apple spoke about clean energy and closed loop innovation at Japan's Innovation for Cool Earth Forum (ICEF), an international gathering to tackle climate change through technical innovation.\nOctober 2018 (South Korea): Apple met with government officials in Korea to advocate for increased renewable generation and for retail choice, whereby consumers can select their power source.\nApril 2018 (U.S.): Apple filed individual comments to the U.S. EPA, urging it not to repeal the Clean Power Plan because of its importance in reducing emissions.\nApril 2018 (China): Apple submitted formal comments to China's National Development and Reform Commission about the implications of draft policy on corporate clean energy procurement.\nFebruary 2018 (Japan): Apple filed comments with the Japanese government, calling for the development of a robust and verifiable renewable energy trading system.\nJanuary 2018 (U.S.): Apple filed comments to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, urging it not to finalize a rule that would subsidize fossil fuels, which would limit the ability of renewables to compete in the electricity market. FERC chose not to finalize that rule.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 54\n\fAppendix A\nApple's Operations: Environmental Data\nFacilities Environmental Performance Indicators (Page 56) Product Environmental Performance Indicators (Page 57) Scopes 1 and 2 Carbon Emissions Breakdown (Page 58) Natural Gas and Electricity Use (fiscal year 2018) (Page 59)\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 55\n\fFacilities Environmental Performance Indicators\nThe following table summarizes environmental performance indicators relating to Apple's global facilities, including our data centers, corporate offices, and over 500 retail stores, together occupied by 132,000 Apple employees.1\n\nKPI\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions\nEnergy Use\nEnergy Efficiency8\nRenewable Energy\nWater Use\nWaste Generation13\n\nScope 1 Natural gas, diesel, propane2 Fleet vehicles\nProcess emissions3 Scope 24 Scope 35 Business travel6 Employee commute7\nTotal facilities emissions (Scopes 1, 2, 3) Electricity U.S. International Natural gas U.S. International\nElectricity saved per year as a result of energy efficiency measures\nNatual gas saved per year as a result of energy efficiency measures\nRenewable energy sourcing (fiscal year)9\nEmissions avoided as a result of renewable energy sourcing (fiscal year)10 Total Data centers11 Retail Corporate12\nLandfilled\nRecycled Composted Hazardous waste Waste to energy14 Landfill diversion rate\n\nFiscal Year\n\nUnit\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\n54,590\n\n45,400\n\n39,990\n\n34,560\n\n11,110\n\n8,300\n\n3,490\n\n2,540\n\nmetric tons COe\n\n8,730 520,500 337,340\n\n36,250 293,440 121,000\n\n183,160\n\n172,440\n\n583,820\n\n375,090\n\nmillion kWh million BTU\n\n2,182 1,830 351 1,419,240 1,333,850 85,390\n\n1,832 1,536 296 1,225,210 1,127,550 97,660\n\n2016 34,370 27,000 7,370 -- 41,000 303,910 117,550 186,360\n379,280\n1,420 1,157 262 974,570 901,950 72,620\n\n2015 28,100 19,360 8,740 -- 42,460 312,910 139,940 172,970\n383,470\n996 831 166 851,660 794,830 56,830\n\n2014 28,490 20,710 7,780 -- 63,210 259,130 110,940 148,190\n350,830\n839 702 137 922,860 840,490 82,370\n\n2013 29,300 22,090 7,210 -- 91,510 225,630 90,948 134,685\n346,440\n708 590 118 764,550 676,630 87,920\n\n2012 21,220 14,300 6,920 -- 139,160 202,060 85,090 116,970\n362,440\n608* -- -- 304,000 240,230 63,770\n\nkWh/year 113,203,780 69,989,660 55,288,800 37,875,000 31,225,000 26,241,600 11,354,200\n\ntherms/year 2,541,440\n\n2,453,410\n\n2,228,477\n\n1,676,735\n\n1,431,215\n\n1,238,291\n\n548,508\n\n%\n\n99\n\n97\n\n96\n\n93\n\n87\n\n73\n\n60\n\nmetric tons COe\n\n690,000\n\n589,000\n\nmillion gallons\npounds %\n\n1,260 460 110 690 36,553,900 108,515,200 10,397,400 6,277,800 1,105,100 74\n\n1,000 410 110 480 31,595,200 68,509,300 14,567,500 3,342,700 645,000 71\n\n541,000\n630 207 99 324 21,618,850 28,198,560 13,737,320 2,287,320 -- 66\n\n336,000\n573 166 111 296 13,110,880 19,599,570 3,006,170 1,002,300 -- 63\n\n255,000\n494 113 103 278 6,833,000 14,621,940 -- 508,040 -- 68\n\n195,000\n430 69 94 267 5,923,810 15,866,650 -- 70,550 -- 73\n\n116,000\n345 57 71 217 4,850,160 11,464,020 -- 123,460 -- 70\n\nNotes\n As reported in Apple's Form 10-K Annual Report filed with the SEC for fiscal year 2018.\n2Starting in fiscal year 2016, Scope 1 Emissions capture diesel use in emergency back-up generators and propane gas use in corporate offices.\n3 Emissions from R&D processes.\n4The building operations and cooling emissions (PUE) associated with our colocated data facilities are beyond our operational control and therefore these emissions are not included in our report.\n5In fiscal year 2017, we started calculating scope 3 emissions not listed above. In fiscal year 2018, these include electricity transmission and distribution losses (21,500 metric tons CO2e) and lifecycle emissions associated with renewable energy (78,000 metric tons CO2e).\n6We are constantly revisiting our methodology to hold ourselves to high accountability standards. So in fiscal year 2018, we changed how we calculate emissions from business travel in order to better account for classes of service in air travel. As a result of this change, our scope 3 transportation emissions increased by 77 percent. Without the methodology change, these emissions would have increased by 14 percent, which reflects the growth in our business.\n\n7 We adjusted our methodology for fiscal year 2017 to take into account Apple's \"At Home Advisors\" program, where employees work remotely.\n8Because energy efficiency measures have lasting benefits, energy efficiency savings are calculated cumulatively since 2011. All efficiency measures are retired based on their effective useful lifetime as documented by the Claifornia Energy Commission.\n9We calculate our progress toward 100 percent renewable energy on a calendar year basis. Beginning January 1, 2018, 100 percent of the electricity we use to power our global facilities is sourced from renewable energy.\n10We have adjusted previous years' avoided emissions to remove double counting biogas emissons.\n11 Beginning in fiscal year 2017, \"Data centers\" includes water use at colocation facilities.\n12 Beginning in fiscal year 2017, \"Corporate\" includes water use at Apple distribution centers.\n13Beginning in fiscal year 2017, we're including waste from Apple's distribution centers. Starting fiscal year 2018, electronic waste is reported under the \"Recycled\" figure.\n14 Beginning in fiscal year 2017, waste processed in \"Waste to energy\" facilities is reported separately.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 56\n\fProduct Environmental Performance Indicators\nThe following table summarizes the environmental performance indicators relating to Apple's products--including the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with the manufacturing, transportation, use, and end of life of our products. In fiscal year 2018, we sold 217,722,000 iPhone devices, 43,535,000 iPad units, and 18,209,000 Mac products.1\nWe also publish individual product environmental reports for all of our products.

Over time, we have greatly refined our model to include more Apple-specific data instead of industry averages. The decrease in Scope 3 emissions in fiscal year 2016 is partly due to these modeling changes, including improved modeling of the integrated circuits in Apple products. Further, there are systematic changes made in some emissions factors to reflect changes in global electricity grids.\n Scope 3 emissions associated with employee commute and business travel are included in the table \"Facilities Environmental Performance Indicators.\"\n Carbon emissions associated with our products' end of life decreased in fiscal year 2017, because of changes in methodology to more accurately reflect disposal and recycling practices.\n Arsenic is present in minute quantities in some semiconductor devices.\nEvery Apple product is free of PVC and phthalates with the exception of power cords in India, Thailand, and South Korea, where we continue to seek government approval for our PVC and phthalates replacement. 7Apple products comply with the European Union Directive 2011/65/EU and its amendments, including exemptions for the use of lead such as high-temperature solder. Apple is working to phase out the use of these exempted\nsubstances where technically possible. 8 While Apple's phaseout covers the vast majority of products and components, products by Beddit, which Apple recently acquired, and some older Apple product designs may not be fully BFRfree and PVCfree. However, these\nproducts, including their replacement parts and accessories, were still designed to meet regulatory requirements.\nOverview of Apple's product life cycle carbon assessment (LCA) methodology\nApple uses five steps when conducting a product LCA.\n1. To model the manufacturing phase, we use part-by-part measurements of the entire product along with data on part production. The measurements help us accurately determine the size and weight of the components and materials in the product, while data on manufacturing processes and yield loss during production allows us to account for the impact of manufacturing. The LCA includes accessories, packaging, and units that are repaired and replaced through AppleCare.\n2. To model customer use, we measure the power consumed by a product while it is running in a simulated scenario. Daily usage patterns are specific to each product and are a mixture of actual and modeled customer use data. For the purposes of our assessment, years of use, which are based on first owners, are modeled to be four years for macOS and tvOS devices and three years for iOS and watchOS devices. Most Apple products last longer and are passed along, resold, or returned to Apple by the first owner for others to use. More information on our product energy use is provided in our Product Environmental Reports.\n3. To model transportation, we use data collected on shipments of single products and multipack units by land, sea, and air. We account for transporting materials between manufacturing sites; transporting products from manufacturing sites to regional distribution hubs; transporting products from regional distribution hubs to individual customers; and transporting products from final customers to recycling facilities.\n4. To model recycling, we use material composition data on our products and cover the treatment steps carried out by the recycler to obtain metal, plastic, and glass material streams. Subsequent processing and remelting steps are not included, as these are considered stages of production and not endoflife processing.\n5. After we collect data about production, use, transport, and recycling, we combine it with detailed greenhouse gas emission data. This emission data is based on a combination of Apple-specific and industry-average datasets for material production, manufacturing processes, electricity generation, and transportation. Renewable energy used in the supply chain, initiated by suppliers independently or through the Apple Supplier Clean Energy Program, are also accounted for. Combining product-specific data with emission data in our LCA tool allows us to compile detailed results for greenhouse gas emissions as they relate to the product. The data and modeling approaches are checked for quality and accuracy by the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany.\nThere is inherent uncertainty in modeling carbon emissions due primarily to data limitations. For the top component contributors to Apple's carbon emissions, Apple addresses this uncertainty by developing detailed process-based environmental models with Apple-specific parameters. For the remaining elements of Apple's carbon footprint, we rely on industry average data and assumptions.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 57\n\fScopes 1 and 2 Carbon Emissions Breakdown (metric tons COe)\n\nFiscal Year\nLocation\nCorporate Cupertino, CA Elk Grove, CA Austin, TX Other U.S. Cork, Ireland Singapore China Other International\nData centers Maiden, NC Newark, CA Prineville, OR Reno, NV Mesa, AZ Viborg, Denmark Colocation facilities (U.S.)** Colocation facilities (International)**\nRetail stores U.S. International\nBusiness fleet\nProcess emissions***\nOther Scope 1 (Diesel, Propane, fugitive emissions)\nTotals\n\nScope 1\n29,980 24,720 630 320 1,350 890 30 200 1,840\n60 30 0 20 0 10 -- N/A N/A\n4,300 2,720 1,580\n11,110\n3,490\n5,640\n54,600\n\n2018\nScope 2\n7,980 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7,980\n410 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 410\n350 0 350\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n8,730\n\nScope 1\n25,430 20,580 530 330 1,160 710 90 220 1,810\n4,210 150 70 950 1,530 1,510 -- N/A N/A\n4,920 2,490 2,430\n8,300\n2,540\n--\n45,400\n\n2017*\nScope 2\n33,290 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 33,290\n1,520 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1,520\n1,440 0 1,440\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n36,250\n\nScope 1\n20,537 17,121 397 248 883 780 65 38 1,005\n2,738 126 139 1,077 713 683 -- N/A N/A\n3,679 1,597 2,082\n7,370\n--\n--\n34,324\n\n2016\nScope 2\n30,408 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 30,408\n1,621 0 0 0 0 0 -- 0 1,621\n8,920 0 8,920\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n40,953\n\nScope 1\n15,415 13,248 369 233 121 892 0 117 435\n13 0 0 13 0 -- -- N/A N/A\n3,800 2,269 1,531\n8,744\n--\n--\n27,972\n\n2015\nScope 2\n19,564 0 0 0 0 0 3,767 2,201 13,596\n0 0 0 0 0 -- -- -- --\n22,893 0 22,893\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n42,457\n\nFiscal Year\nLocation\nCorporate Cupertino, CA Elk Grove, CA Austin, TX Other U.S. Cork, Ireland Singapore China Other International\nData centers Maiden, NC Newark, CA Prineville, OR Reno, NV\nRetail stores Domestic (U.S.) International\nBusiness fleet\nTotals\n\nScope 1\n15,335 12,929 411 148 115 1,000 51 385 296\n18 0 0 18 0\n5,355 2,812 2,543\n7,778\n28,486\n\n2014\nScope 2\n21,555 0 0 0 0 0 6,852 8,577 6,126\n0 0 0 0 0\n41,658 11,036 30,662\nN/A\n63,213\n\nScope 1\n13,727 10,747 509 83 337 743 50 390 868\n2,201 2,201 0 0 0\n6,158 3,548 2,610\n7,214\n29,300\n\n2013\nScope 2\n17,503 0 0 0 0 0 5,826 7,490 4,187\n0 0 0 0 0\n74,002 44,606 29,397\nN/A\n91,505\n\nScope 1\n11,343 9,132 560 59 237 715 32 -- 609\n146 146 0 0 0\n2,812 787 2,025\n6,923\n21,224\n\n2012\nScope 2\n48,215 25,450 0 0 4,265 0 4,946 1,049 12,505\n7,664 0 7,664 0 0\n83,285 -- --\nN/A\n139,164\n\nScope 1\n12,656 9,238 556 45 564 804 -- -- 1,449\n0 0 0 -- --\n2,600 746 1,854\n6,400\n21,656\n\n2011\nScope 2\n59,516 39,428 0 0 2,141 0 3,243 280 14,424\n28,988 0 28,988 -- --\n65,769 -- --\nN/A\n154,273\n\n-- Indicates that the energy source is not yet online.\nScope 1 emissions result from natural gas use in buildings, and fuel use for fleet vehicles.

Scope 1 emissions are calculated using emissions factors from EPA clean energy website https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/ center-corporate-climate-leadership-ghg-emission-factors-hub.\nScope 2 emissions result from electricity use for Apple's facilities, calculated using a market-based approach, following the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n* A pple also calculates what our emissions would have been had we not taken action to supply new, clean renewable energy to our facilities. If we remove the emissions reduction benefits of our renewable energy program, then our Scope 1 emissions in fiscal year 2018 would have been 95,636 metric tons COe and our Scope 2 emissions would have been 698,944 COe for our corporate operations, data centers, and retail stores. In fiscal year 2018, combustion of biogas for our fuel cells resulted in 41,040 metric tons of direct COe emissions. The biogas fuel cells are included in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions since they are within our operational control and their renewable certificates are matched with our data center load. These emissions are not counted in Apple's footprint because they would have occurred naturally even if we had not combusted the biogas.\n**The building operations and cooling emissions (PUE) associated with our colocated data facilities are beyond our operational control and therefore these emissions are not included in our report.\n*** Emissions from R&D processes.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 58\n\fNatural Gas and Electricity Use (fiscal year 2018)\nThe chart below provides a detailed breakdown of fiscal year 2018 energy use, which we used to calculate our greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nFiscal Year 2018\n\nLocation\nCorporate Cupertino, CA Elk Grove, CA Austin, TX Other U.S. Cork, Ireland Singapore China Other International\nData centers Maiden, NC Newark, CA Prineville, OR Reno, NV Mesa, AZ Viborg, Denmark Colocation Facilities (USA)** Colocation Facilities (International)**\nRetail stores Domestic (U.S.) International\nTotals\nPercent renewable*\n\nTotal Gas (mmBTU)\n796,730 697,670 11,840 6,090 25,410 16,730 630 3,830 34,530\n541,690 540,970 -- 460 -- 260 -- N/A N/A\n80,820 51,160 29,660\n1,419,240\n\nNatural Gas\nRenewable Biogas (mmBTU)\n232,430 232,430 -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n540,970 540,970 -- -- -- -- -- N/A N/A\n-- -- --\n773,400\n54%\n\nTotal Electricity (million kWh)\n638 381 15 54 22 16 16 29 105\n1,349 295 114 252 253 104 4 244 83\n195 96 99\n2,182\n\nElectricity\nRenewable Electricity (million kWh)\n625 381 15 54 22 16 16 29 92\n1,348 295 114 252 253 104 4 244 82\n194 96 98\n2,167\n99%\n\n-- Data not tracked N/A = Gas use at colocation facilities is considered outside of Apple's operational control. * Beginning January 1, 2018, we reached 100 percent renewable energy. ** W e've updated our fiscal year 2016 colocation facilities footprint to reflect more accurately Apple's operational boundaries.

We've learned a lot about how best to secure renewable energy, which has helped us educate suppliers and expand our renewable energy efforts into our supply chain. This Facilities Renewable Energy Supplement summarizes the types of renewable energy solutions we've deployed, and details how we implement renewable energy at our data centers--our largest energy loads.\nHow we secure renewable energy\nSince launching our renewable energy program in 2011, we have implemented a number of solutions to procure renewable energy. Our strategy has evolved over time to create the most positive impact.\nOwnership and PURPA. In 2011, Apple's 100 percent equity ownership of our Maiden solar arrays was the first time a non-energy commercial company built its own utility-scale solar PV project. We used a 1978 federal law called the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) to structure the project. We then applied this same structure to two more large solar PV and biogas fuel cell projects in North Carolina and two micro-hydro projects in Oregon. This was a landmark moment in corporate renewable energy development and led to an increased use of PURPA in these states.\nDirect Access. Since 2012, in California and Oregon, we've used a program called Direct Access to bypass the default electricity generation offered by the utilities servicing our data centers in those states. Instead, we contracted directly with independent power producers who could supply 100 percent renewable electricity. After initially buying from existing, third-party owned projects, we're now procuring renewable energy from projects we created: The Solar Star II project delivers renewables to our Oregon data center, and the California Flats solar project to our data center in California.\nGreen rider. In 2013, we opened a new data center in Reno, Nevada. With no PURPA or Direct Access options in Nevada, we worked directly with the local utility, NV Energy, to create a whole new regulatory structure. The \"Nevada Green Rider\" enables us to secure a long-term, fixedprice contract for renewable electricity from a new solar PV project built for us, but managed by the utility. We've used this partnership to create four solar projects totaling 320 megawatts.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 60\n\fEquity investment. In 2014, we invested in two 20-megawatt solar PV projects in Sichuan, China to support all our in-country retail stores, corporate offices, and data storage facilities. This project represented the first time a commercial company created a new large-scale project in China for its own use. We've since replicated this model many times for Apple's supply chain.\nPortfolio solutions. In 2015 and 2016, we adapted to land scarcity constraints in Singapore and Japan by contracting for solar PV on 800 rooftops in Singapore and 300 in Japan. We adapted our approach in each country to fit local partnerships and regulatory structures: We signed a long-term agreement similar to a power purchase agreement in Singapore and made an equity investment in Japan. These projects offer us long-term flexibility as our load grows.\nRenewable microgrid. Since 2017, we've been powering Apple Park with 100 percent renewable energy--about 75 percent of which is generated onsite and managed by a microgrid. The onsite generation comes from 14 megawatts of rooftop solar PV and 4 megawatts of baseload biogas fuel cells. Any additional energy required is drawn by Direct Access from the California Flats solar project in nearby Monterey County. The microgrid system with battery storage manages the renewable energy generation and the building's energy use; optimizes demand management, load shifting, and frequency regulation services; and ensures uninterrupted energy reliability against local grid outages.\nA focus on data centers\nWe used over 1.3 billion kWh of electricity in fiscal year 2018 to power our data centers and colocation facilities around the world, representing over 60 percent of Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We're proud that 100 percent of that electricity came from clean, renewable sources including solar, wind, biogas fuel cells, and low-impact hydro power. To cover our needs, we build our own renewable power projects and work with utilities to purchase clean energy from locally obtained resources. In fiscal year 2018, we avoided the equivalent of more than 466,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions by using 100 percent renewable energy for our data centers--that's equivalent to taking almost 100,000 cars off the road for a year.1\nWe're staying at 100 percent even as Apple's data center presence continues to grow. We now operate five data centers, and several more are being developed. These data centers are spread across North America, Europe, and Asia. Each has unique design features that conserve energy and reflect the climate, as well as other aspects, of its location.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\n1 G reenhouse gas equivalencies calculated using the U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator: http://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 61\n\fSolar + Biogas Fuel Cells\nMaiden, North Carolina\nBetween 2011 and 2015, we installed 68 megawatts of Apple-created projects: two 20-megawatt solar projects, an 18-megawatt solar project, and 10 megawatts of biogas fuel cells. We then partnered with the local utility, Duke Energy, to help build five solar projects through its Green Source Rider program. These solar projects came online beginning in 2015 and were Duke Energy's first Green Source Rider projects to become operational. We worked with Duke Energy for several years to develop this green energy tariff option, which allowed Apple and Duke Energy to work together to develop new renewable energy projects. The five projects have a combined capacity of 20 megawatts. In 2017, we made long-term commitments to five more solar projects in North Carolina, for an additional 86 megawatts of clean energy. In fiscal year 2018, the Maiden data center was supported by projects that generated 303 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the energy used by almost 24,000 North Carolina homes.2\nEnergy efficiency measures we've implemented at our Maiden data centers include use of outside air cooling through a waterside economizer during night and cool-weather hours, which, along with water storage, allows the chillers to be idle 75 percent of the time.\n\nMaiden, North Carolina--100% renewable since opening June 2010\n\n303 million kWh energy use in fiscal year 2018\n\nDuke Energy Default Grid Mix\n\nApple Actual Renewable Energy Use\n\nNuclear\n\n51% Apple's Solar Projects\n\n38%\n\nCoal\n\n33% Apple's Biogas Fuel Cells\n\n24%\n\nOther\n\n16% Duke Green Source Rider\n\n12%\n\n(100% solar)\n\nRenewable\n\n<1% NC GreenPower (100% solar)\n\n14%\n\nOther Solar Contracts\n\n12%\n\n2018 Default Emissions\n\n110,910 2018 Effective Emissions\n\n0\n\n(mtons COe/year)\n\n(mtons COe/year)\n\nFrom Duke Energy Carolinas 2015 Statistical Supplement generation data\n\nActual fiscal year 2018 energy data\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\n2 C arbon emissions equivalences calculated using U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2017 data: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf.\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 62\n\fWind + Solar + Low-Impact Hydro\nPrineville, Oregon\nTo support our Prineville data center, we recently signed a 200-megawatt power purchase agreement for a new Oregon wind farm, the Montague Wind Power Facility, set to come online later in 2019. It's our largest project to date, producing over 560 million kWh of clean, renewable energy a year.\nAdditionally, we executed a power purchase agreement for the 56-megawatt Solar Star Oregon II project located just a few miles from our data center. This solar PV project, which came online and began supporting the data center in 2017, produces 140 million kWh of renewable energy a year. To strengthen the connection between Apple and these projects, we use Oregon's Direct Access program to supply the renewable energy from these projects directly to our data center.\nAlso supporting the data center are two micro-hydro projects that harness the power of water flowing through local irrigation canals that have been operating for over 60 years. These microhydro projects generate about 7 to 10 million kWh of renewable energy a year.\nTo supplement these projects, we executed a long-term purchase agreement for all environmental attributes from a 50-megawatt portfolio of six solar projects in Oregon.\nIn fiscal year 2018, the Prineville data center was supported by projects that generated 252 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the energy used by 21,670 Oregon homes.2\nOur Prineville data center takes advantage of the cool and dry climate by cooling the servers with outside air whenever possible.

So, in 2013, we created a partnership with the local utility, NV Energy, to develop the Fort Churchill Solar project. Apple designed, financed, and constructed the project, and NV Energy operates it and directs all the renewable energy it produces to our data center. The Fort Churchill Solar project uses a photovoltaic panel with curved mirrors that concentrate sunlight. The 20-megawatt array has an annual production capacity of over 43 million kWh.\nTo facilitate further renewable development in Nevada, Apple worked with NV Energy and the Nevada utility commission to create a green energy option open to all commercial customers, called the Nevada Green Rider, that does not require the customer to fund project development up-front. Thanks to this new option, in 2015 we announced our second Nevada solar project, the 50-megawatt Boulder Solar II project. This project came online in 2017, producing 137 million kWh of renewable energy a year.\nWe have used the Nevada Green Rider two more times, first for the 200-megawatt Techren Solar II project. Apple's largest solar project to date, it is estimated to produce over 540 million kWh when it comes online later this year. Next was the 50-megawatt Turquoise Nevada project, estimated to produce 110 million kWh a year and come online in 2020.\nIn fiscal year 2018, the Reno data center was supported by projects that generated 253 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the energy used by 24,690 Nevada homes.2\nLike in Prineville, our Reno data center takes advantage of the mild climate by cooling the servers with outside air whenever possible. When the outside air is too warm to cool the servers alone, it draws from indirect evaporative cooling.\n\nReno, Nevada--100% renewable since opening December 2012\n\n253 million kWh energy use in fiscal year 2018\n\nNV Energy--North Default Grid Mix\n\nApple Actual Renewable Energy Use\n\nNatural Gas\n\n58% Apple's Solar Projects (via the Nevada Green Rider program)\n\n100%\n\nCoal\n\n16%\n\nLarge Hydro\n\n8%\n\nOther\n\n2%\n\nRenewable\n\n16%\n\n2018 Default Emissions\n\n78,760 2018 Effective Emissions\n\n0\n\n(mtons COe/year)\n\n(mtons COe/year)\n\nhttps://www.nvenergy.com/publish/content/dam/ nvenergy/bill _ inser ts/2019/01 _ jan/power-content-inser tsouth-2019-01_03_31.pdf\n\nActual fiscal year 2018 energy data\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\n2 C arbon emissions equivalences calculated using U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2017 data: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf.\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 64\n\fSolar\nNewark, California\nOur data center in Newark, California, is powered by 100 percent renewable energy.

The solar project, at 42 megawatts, will be one of Denmark's largest.\nDue to its proximity to one of Denmark's largest electrical substations, the data center won't require backup generators, which typically run on diesel and require periodic testing and burning of fuel.\nWe're working with Aarhus University, Foulum campus, which is conducting important research to increase the production of anaerobic digesters. We are co-developing a project using agricultural waste biomass, which has long been used in Denmark to generate energy.\nChina\nWe have two new data centers in development in China, one in Guizhou Province, the other in Inner Mongolia. Both will be supplied with 100 percent renewable energy.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\n2 C arbon emissions equivalences calculated using U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2017 data: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf.\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 66\n\fOur colocation facilities\nThe majority of our online services are provided by our own data centers; however, we also use third-party colocation facilities for additional data center capacity. While we don't own these shared facilities and use only a portion of their total capacity, we include our portion of their energy use in our renewable energy goals. Starting January 2018, 100 percent of our power for colocation facilities was matched with renewable energy generated within the same state or NERC region for facilities in the United States, or within the same country or regional grid for those around the world. As our loads grow over time, we'll continue working with our colocation suppliers to match 100 percent of our energy use with renewables.\nFurthermore, we worked with one of our main suppliers of colocation services to help it develop the capability to provide renewable energy solutions to its customers. This partnership advances Apple's renewable energy program and those of other companies that use this colocation provider.\n\nEnergy Use and Emissions at Apple's Colocation Facilities\n\nFY2011 FY2012 FY2013 FY2014 FY2015 FY20164 FY2017 FY2018\n\nTotal Energy Use (kWh) 42,500\n38,552,300 79,462,900 108,659,700 142,615,000 145,520,900 289,195,800 327,663,800\n\nRenewable Energy (kWh) 0\n1,471,680 46,966,900 88,553,400 121,086,100 143,083,200 286,378,100 326,959,700\n\nDefault Utility Emissions1\n(metric tons CO2e) 10\n17,200 31,800 44,300 60,500 66,300 125,600 146,600\n\nApple's Emissions-- Including Renewable\nEnergy2 (metric tons CO2e)\n10\n16,500\n14,500\n11,000\n12,700\n1,600\n1,500\n400\n\nPercent Renewable Energy3 0% 4% 59% 81% 85% 98% 99% 99.8%\n\n1 We calculate \"default utility emissions\" to provide baseline emissions of what our carbon footprint would have been without the use of renewable energy. This allows us to demonstrate the savings resulting from our renewable energy program.\n2 Apple's greenhouse gas emissions are calculated using the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology for calculating market-based emissions.\n3 We calculate our progress toward our 100 percent renewable energy goal on a calendar year basis, while the numbers reported in this table are based on fiscal year. Beginning January 1, 2018, all of the electricity use at our colocation facilities is from 100 percent renewable energy.\n4 Over the past two years, we have been installing submeters in colocation facilities to better track electricity usage. Beginning in FY2016, we started reporting this submetered electricity usage. Prior to fiscal year 2016, reported electricity usage was conservatively estimated based on maximum contract capacity quantities. We've updated our fiscal year 2016 colocation facilities footprint to reflect more accurately Apple's operational boundaries. Per the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol, we've removed from our electricity usage and Scope 2 calculations those emissions associated with colocation facility cooling and building operations.\n\nRegional Energy Use at Apple's Colocation Facilities\n\nU.S. Europe APAC FY2018 Total\n\nTotal Energy Use (kWh)\n244,376,400 30,831,400 52,456,000\n327,663,800\n\nRenewable Energy (kWh)\n244,376,400 30,114,500 52,368,800\n326,859,700\n\nPercent Renewable Energy 100% 98% 100% 99.8%\n\nBeyond the use of our own data centers and colocation facilities, we also use third-party computing services to support some of our on-demand cloud storage-based services.

This review and verification focuses on Scope 3 emissions for products sold by Apple Inc. (as defined by WRI/WBCSD/Greenhouse Gas Protocol  Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard). It is noted that emissions relating to the facilities that are owned or leased by Apple (scope 1 and 2 emissions) as well as business travel and employee commute were subject to a separate third party verification and are therefore excluded from the scope of this statement. Confidential data relating to product sales and shipments were also excluded from the scope of this verification.\nThis review and verification covers Apple's annual greenhouse gas emissions and does not replace reviews conducted for individual product LCAs for greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). The life cycle emissions data produced by Apple for individual products has been calculated in accordance to the standard ISO 14040/14044: Environmental management  Life cycle assessment  Principles and framework / Requirements and guidelines. This review and verification furthermore complies with ISO 14064-3: Greenhouse gases -- Part 3: Specification with guidance for the validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions.\nThe review of the annual carbon footprint has considered the following criteria:\n The system, boundaries and functional unit are clearly defined\n Assumptions and estimations made are appropriate\n Selection of primary and secondary data is appropriate and methodologies used\nare adequately disclosed\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\nComprehensive Carbon Footprint Letter of Assurance Client: Apple Inc.\n\n1\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 72\n\fThese criteria are also fundamental to the review of LCAs conducted for individual product emissions. The reviewers note that the largest share (98%) of Apple Inc. annual carbon footprint is comprised of scope 3 emissions from individual products. The aforementioned criteria have been regularly reviewed by Fraunhofer IZM since 2007 with a view to providing independent feedback that can facilitate continuous improvement and refinement in the LCA methodology applied by Apple Inc.\n\nData reported by Apple is as follows:\n\nManufacturing Transportation Product Use\n\n2018\n\n18.49\n\n1.33\n\n4.65\n\n[MMT CO2e]\n\n[MMT CO2e]\n\n[MMT CO2e]\n\nMMT CO2e: million metric tons carbon dioxide equivalents\n\nRecycling\n0.05\n[MMT CO2e]\n\nIncluding a reported value of 0.58 million metric tons CO2e for facilities (out of scope of this verification), total comprehensive carbon footprint is reported to be 25.2 million metric tons CO2e.\n\nApple's comprehensive carbon footprint includes an increasing amount of greenhouse gas emissions reductions for manufacturing resulting from Apple renewable energy projects, supplier renewable electricity purchases, and supplier renewable electricity installations. These reductions are part of Apple's Clean Energy Program. Fraunhofer IZM has not verified these emissions reductions.\n\nBased on the process and procedures conducted, there is no evidence that the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) assertion with regards to scope 3 carbon footprint\n\n is not materially correct and is not a fair representation of GHG data and\ninformation, and\n\n has not been prepared in accordance with the related International Standard on\nGHG quantification, monitoring and reporting.\n\n2 Reviewed Data and Plausibility Check\n\nA verification and sampling plan as required by ISO 14046-3 has been established for the comprehensive carbon footprint review and verification, defining the level of assurance, objectives, criteria, scope and materiality of the verification.\nAs part of this review and verification Apple disclosed following data to Fraunhofer IZM:\n Sales data for FY2018, including accessories and including AppleCare, Apple's\nextended warranty and technical support plans for their devices.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\nComprehensive Carbon Footprint Letter of Assurance Client: Apple Inc.\n\n2\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 73\n\f Product specific data on transportation including breakdown of air and sea\nshipment\n Life cycle GHG emissions for all products, differentiating the actual product\nconfigurations (e.g. memory capacity)\n Calculation methodology for the comprehensive carbon footprint and\nmethodological changes implemented in 2018\n The total carbon footprint  scope 3 for the fiscal year 2018\n Detailed analysis of the comprehensive carbon footprint including:\no The breakdown of the carbon footprint into life cycle phases manufacturing, transportation, product use and recycling\no Detailed product specific split into life cycle phases o The contribution of individual products and product families to the overall\ncarbon footprint\nThe data and information supporting the GHG assertion were projected (use phase and recycling) and historical (i.e. fiscal year 2018 data regarding sales figures, manufacturing, transportation).\nThis review comprises a check of selected data, which are most influential to the overall carbon footprint. The overall plausibility check addressed the following questions:\n Are product LCAs referenced correctly?\n Are results for products, for which no full LCA review was undertaken, plausible?\n Are carbon emission data for individual products plausible in the light of\nmethodological changes as indicated by Apple?\nThis review was done remotely.\n3 Findings\nIn FY2018 and beginning of FY2019 10 recent product LCA studies have been reviewed successfully against ISO 14040/44. These LCAs cover product segments MacBook Pro, iMac, Apple Watch, Homepod and iPhone. These recently reviewed LCA studies cover products which represent in total 44,9% of the total scope 3 carbon footprint. Representatives of other product segments (iPod, iPad, Mac Pro, Mac Mini, Airport Express\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\nComprehensive Carbon Footprint Letter of Assurance Client: Apple Inc.\n\n3\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 74\n\f/ Airport Extreme, Apple TV, and Beats products) underwent no or only minor design changes compared to those which went through a full LCA review in former years. All reviewed LCA studies up to now cover in total 67,9% of the total scope 3 carbon footprint.\nAll questions raised in the course of the review were answered by Apple and related evidence was provided where needed.\n\n4 Conclusions\nApple' assessment approach is excellent in terms of granularity of the used calculation data. A significant share of components is modelled with accurate primary data from Apple's suppliers.\nFor all product LCA calculations, where exact data was missing, the principle of a worstcase approach has been followed and results have been calculated with rather conservative estimates.\nThe review has not found assumptions or calculation errors on the carbon footprint data level that indicate the scope 3 carbon footprint has been materially misstated. The excellent analysis meets the principles of good scientific practice.\nBerlin, April 3, 2019\n\n- Karsten Schischke Fraunhofer IZM Dept.

The output is a total packaging plastic footprint.\n\nThe review of the corporate annual packaging plastic footprint has considered the following criteria:\n The system boundaries are clearly defined  Assumptions and estimations made are appropriate  Use of supplier data is appropriate and methodologies used are adequately\ndisclosed\n\nData reported by Apple is as follows:\n\n2018\n\nTotal Plastic\n19,000\n[metric tons plastic]\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\nCorporate Packaging Plastic Footprint Review Client: Apple Inc.\n\n1\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 82\n\fThe two main drivers for the plastic packaging footprint are HIPS (high-impact polystyrene) and adhesives.\nAll results and figures reviewed for fiscal year 2018 are plausible.\n2 Reviewed Data and Findings\nAs part of this review Apple disclosed following data to Fraunhofer IZM:\n Calculation methodology for the corporate packaging plastic footprint  Sales data for FY2018, including accessories  Selected product and supplier specific data on packaging materials and production\nyields\n Aggregated packaging plastic data for all products and the total corporate\npackaging plastic footprint for the fiscal year 2018\nThe methodology paper provided by Apple (Packaging Plastic Footprint at Apple  Methodology Description  V1.0) in 2018, is considered a sound and appropriate guidance for determining the company packaging plastic. Where appropriate, this approach follows methodological principles applied for state-of-the-art Life Cycle Assessments.\nThis review comprises a check of packaging plastic data for selected products (iPhone X, iPhone 8 Plus MacBook 13\" Air). Plausibility of some data has been questioned and discussed with Apple in detail. Corrections were made accordingly. Similarly, scope for the packaging plastic and fibre footprint have been discussed. Including ink use of photobooks in future footprints is suggested for consistency between plastic and fibre footprint, although the impact on the overall packaging plastic footprint is expected to be low. This review was done remotely. All questions raised in the course of the review were answered by Apple and related evidence was provided where needed.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\nCorporate Packaging Plastic Footprint Review Client: Apple Inc.\n\n2\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 83\n\fBased on the process and procedures conducted, there is no evidence that the corporate packaging plastic footprint is not materially correct and is not a fair representation of plastic data and information.

We consider wood fibers to include bamboo.\n3 A pple defines its restrictions on harmful substances, including definitions for what Apple considers to be \"free of,\" in the Apple Regulated Substances Specification. Every Apple product is free of PVC and phthalates with the exception of AC power cords in India, Thailand, and South Korea, where we continue to seek government approval for our PVC and phthalates replacements. While Apple's phaseout covers the vast majority of products and components, products by Beddit, which Apple recently acquired, and some older Apple product designs may not be fully BFRfree and PVCfree. Apple products comply with the European Union Directive 2011/65/EU and its amendments, including exemptions for the use of lead such as high-temperature solder. Apple is working to phase out the use of these exempted substances where technically possible.\n4 Based on sales-weighted averages.\n5 E missions from corporate facilities increased by one percentage point in 2018, due to a reduced overall carbon footprint and to changes to how we calculate air travel, which significantly increased Scope 3 business travel emissions.\n6 T he CPU, SoC, DRAM, and memory (NAND) make up the bulk of the integrated circuit emissions.\n7 \" Boards and flexes\" refers to bare printed circuit boards and flexible printed circuits.\n8 Integrated circuits, aluminum, bare boards and flexes, display, onboard electronics, steel, and final assembly facilities make up 93 percent of manufacturing emissions. The remaining 7 percent (\"other manufacturing\") includes battery cells, other materials (such as copper), plastic, packaging, glass, and miscellaneous upstream transportation. These are listed in order of their contribution.\n9 \" Electronics\" includes capacitors, resistors, transistors, diodes, and other electronic components soldered to bare board and flexes, other than the integrated circuits.\n10 iOS active charge: active charging of the battery for iOS devices.\n11 m acOS active: active use of macOS devices.\n12 m acOS idle: macOS devices that are awake, but non-active.\n13 o ther: all other modes and devices.\n14 G reenhouse gas equivalencies calculated using the U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator: www.epa.gov/energy/ greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator.\n15 Compared to a conventional, single-converter power supply design. iMac Pro incorporates a high-efficiency, dual-converter power supply design.\n16 Recycling enables use of recovered materials instead of mined materials, thus conserving finite resources. Recycled content claims for materials in our products have been verified by an independent third party to a recycled content standard that conforms to ISO 14021.\n17 Apple is committed to the responsible sourcing of materials for our products. In 2018, our efforts to responsibly source cobalt continued, and 100 percent of identified refiners participated in third-party audits, for the third year in a row. Our independent third-party audits go beyond conflict to consider human rights and other risks.\n18 In 2018, 100 percent of tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold smelters and refiners participated in a third-party audit program. Download Apple's Conflict Minerals Report (PDF).\n19 Testing conducted by Apple in May 2018 using iPhone 6 Plus supporting normal peak performance, prerelease iOS 11.4, and prerelease iOS 12. Keyboard tested using Safari; Camera tested by swiping from the Lock screen. Performance varies based on specific configuration, content, battery health, usage, software versions, and other factors.\n20 When we receive your device, it will be thoroughly inspected to determine if it can be reused or recycled. Recycling recovers a portion of the product materials.\n21 Countries are defined as those in which we have an Apple Retail Store, Apple Online Store, or Apple Premium Reseller.\n22 For more details on FSC Controlled Wood standards, see Forest Stewardship Council, \"FSC Controlled Wood,\" 2017. https://ic.fsc.org/en/what-is-fsc-certification/controlled-wood.\n23 Based on expected equivalent fiber production from our forestry projects and virgin fiber used for Apple product packaging. To determine the output of Apple's projects, we work with our partners to understand the productive potential of these working forests. The forest management plans required to achieve or maintain certification limit harvest volumes to sustainable levels. We use these potential harvest volumes to estimate the sustainable productive capacity of these forests.\n24 Our target is for waste reduction by weight, from a baseline of fiscal year 2018. We consider ongoing operations and renovations within this boundary but not new construction.\n25 Final assembly supplier sites are third-party certified as Zero Waste by UL LLC (UL 2799 Standard). For all platinum certified final assembly sites, this means that they do not generate any waste sent to landfill. In two cases, assembly facilities were certified Gold with a maximum of 5 percent waste to landfill because the carbon impact of shipping materials for recycling outweighed the environmental benefit of diversion.\n26 Our early efforts to footprint our water use show that vast majority of non-electricity related water withdrawals are related to our supply chain. We are working to expand our understanding of our non-electricity water use so that we can build a more comprehensive water footprint. Our best estimates to isolate process water withdrawals helps us prioritize our work in the supply chain to sub-assembly and commodity suppliers like those that build our semiconductors, displays, and enclosures.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nBetter Together\n\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report 86\n\f27 Apple products are free of PVC and phthalates with the exception of power cords in India, Thailand, and South Korea, where we continue to seek government approval for our PVC and phthalates replacement.

First, we work to reduce our total energy consumption by pursuing aggressive energyefficiency initiatives. Second, we match 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations with purchases of renewable energy. Third, we buy carbon offsets for any remaining emissions we haven't yet eliminated.40\nWhen we committed to carbon neutrality, we saw carbon offsets as an interim solution. As we work to reduce our emissions, our need for carbon offsets will continue to decrease. We reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by improving energy efficiency and procuring renewable energy. We reduce our operational Scope 3 emissions by minimizing the need for business travel through encouraging use of video conferencing tools like Google Hangouts for meetings, and facilitating employees to use sustainable commuting options for employees, such as public transit, shuttles, carpooling, or electric vehicles.\nWhen we do purchase carbon offsets, we follow stringent principles. We invest in high-quality, third-party-verified offsets, including landfill gas projects and animal waste management systems.

Climate change is a pressing global issue that poses an imminent threat to our planet. In 2018 alone, we experienced unprecedented heat waves, wildfires, and flooding in California, along with many other extreme weather events around the world. It's clear that immediate action must be taken on a global scale if the impacts of climate change are to be mitigated and, ideally, reversed.\nGoogle has a longstanding commitment to climate action and environmental stewardship. Sustainability has been a core value since Google's founding, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. In 2018, we achieved twelve consecutive years of carbon neutrality and, for the second year in a row, matched 100% of the electricity consumption of our global operations with renewable energy. We also announced our longterm goal to power our operations with carbon-free energy, 24x7, 365 days a year.\nWe're exploring the role of artificial intelligence in helping us achieve even greater energy efficiency gains in our data centers, and we're prioritizing the use of healthy materials with safe chemistry across Google's built spaces. Beyond Google's operations, we're expanding access to the benefits of technology through energy-saving initiatives like the Nest Power Project. We're also working closely with partners to develop tools for policymakers, planners, and researchers that will enable better-informed decisions and actions, like the Environmental Insights Explorer, which provides city-level carbon emissions data.\nIn the years to come, we'll focus on how Google can accelerate the transition toward carbon-free energy and a circular economy, empower everyone with technology that enables sustainable action, and benefit the communities where we operate.\nGoogle remains steadfast in its commitment to sustainability, and we will continue to look for collaborative partnerships and innovative opportunities to help create a clean and healthy planet for everyone.\n\nRuth Porat\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nUrs Hlzle\nSenior Vice President of Technical Infrastructure\n\n2\n\fAbout Google\nAs our founders explained in their first letter to shareholders, Google's goal is to \"develop services that significantly improve the lives of as many people as possible.\"1 We believe in technology's potential to have a positive impact on the world. We also believe we're just scratching the surface. Our vision is to remain a place of incredible creativity and innovation that uses our technical expertise to tackle big problems.\nWe generate revenues primarily by delivering both performance advertising and brand advertising. Google's core products--Android, Chrome, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube--each have more than 1 billion monthly active users.\nWe also offer a broad collection of cloud-based products and services, including G Suite business productivity apps like Docs, Drive, and Calendar and satellite mapping and analysis platforms like Google Earth and Google Earth Engine. In recent years we've expanded into consumer electronics with products including Chromecast, Google Home, Google Nest Hub, Google Pixel, and Google Pixelbook.\nWe're a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., which had $136.8 billion in total revenues in 2018 and 98,771 full-time employees as of December 31, 2018.2\nGoogle's global headquarters are located in Mountain View, California, United States. We also have significant operations in Sunnyvale as well as operations in other cities throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, including San Francisco, San Bruno, and Palo Alto. In this report the term \"Bay Area headquarters\" refers to our operations in both Mountain View and Sunnyvale. We own and lease office and building space, as well as research and development sites, across more than 150 cities, primarily in North America, Europe, South America, and Asia, and we own and operate 15 data centers across four continents.\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\n3\n\fGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nAbout this report\nThe annual data in this report covers our 2018 fiscal year (January 1 to December 31, 2018). The spotlights may also include data and stories from prior years to provide context, as well as some of our progress in 2019. Unless otherwise specified, all environmental performance data included in this report applies to Google LLC. The primary exception is our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy use data, which covers the combined operations of Google and our Other Bets and has been third-party verified.\nFor more information about our environmental sustainability initiatives, including case studies, white papers, and blogs, please see our Sustainability website. Google's \"Our Commitments\" website highlights our work across five areas: Protecting Users, Expanding Opportunity, Including All Voices, Responding to Crises, and Advancing Sustainability. Our Commitments Reports database includes all our public reports on these topics, and our environmental-focused reports can be found in our Sustainability Reports database.

Fulfilling this mission, and bringing the benefits of information not just to the more than 3 billion people who are already online but to the next 4 billion, requires us to use resources ever more efficiently.3\nThe path to a cleaner, healthier future begins with the small decisions we make each day. That's why we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. We're raising the bar in making smart use of Earth's resources, expecting the highest ethical standards throughout our supply chain, and creating products with people and the planet in mind. We're also constantly looking for ways to have a positive environmental impact and be even more responsible in our use of energy, water, and other natural resources--and we want to help others to do the same.\nThis ambition is reflected across our value chain. Our data centers lead the industry in energy efficiency--they're twice as efficient as the industry average for enterprise data centers. We've been carbon neutral since 2007, and now for the second year in a row, we've matched 100% of the electricity our operations use with renewables. This same ethos carries over to our workplaces, with over 1.2 million square meters (13 million square feet) of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified offices, and to our products. Whether\n\nOur approach\n\n6\n\fBy the end of 2018, Nest thermostats had helped customers cumulatively save more than\n29billion\nkWh of energy.\n\nsomeone is using Google at home or as part of an organization running Google Cloud or G Suite, all of the products in our Cloud are carbon neutral. As we continue to grow, we're on a journey to make our Made by Google consumer electronics products work for people and the planet.\nOur tools are built to help everyone reduce their environmental impact, understand the planet, and take sustainable action. By mapping the world's forests and fisheries, our technology is making it easier for policymakers, researchers, and nonprofits to monitor the pulse of the planet. We're also making it easier for everyone to take sustainable action by providing more than 1 billion kilometers (km) (621 million miles) of alternative transit options through Google Maps every day and by helping people reduce their home energy consumption with Nest thermostats, which have helped customers cumulatively save more than 29 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy.\nAddressing a global challenge\nHumanity is consuming natural resources at an astonishing rate. During the 20th century, global raw material use rose at about twice the rate of population growth.4 Every year humanity consumes far more than what the planet can naturally replenish. In 2018, global demand for resources was 1.7 times what the Earth's ecosystems can regenerate in a year.5\nThese statistics highlight the need to rethink the \"take-make-waste\" economic model that human societies have followed since the Industrial Revolution, in which we take a natural resource, make a product from it or burn it for fuel, and eventually send what remains to the landfill as waste. The consequences of this model have created some of the most significant challenges of our time, including climate change, extreme weather events, and plastic pollution, among others.\nClimate change is one of the most significant global challenges of our time, and continued greenhouse gas emissions pose an existential threat to humanity. The science behind this is clear, and recent reports have stressed the urgency of the issue. In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a special report addressing the need for rapid transition and widespread action in the next 12 years if we are to limit global warming to the 1.5 degree Celsius warming scenario.6 Given this pressing time horizon, it's now more important than ever for governments, businesses, and individuals around the world to take immediate and ambitious action on climate at a global scale. We believe that Google's scale, resources, and technological expertise can help the world meet its energy and resource needs in a responsible way that drives innovation and growth.\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nOur approach\n\n7\n\fGoogle's data center in Eemshaven, Netherlands\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nTaking action\nWith millions more people coming online every month, the demand for computing power continues to skyrocket and data center capacity continues to expand to meet this need. But despite this growth, the total amount of electricity used by U.S. data centers has remained constant. Annual consumption increased by 90% from 2000 to 2005, but only by 4% from 2010 to 2014, largely due to data centers' ability to improve their efficiency as they scale.7 As the use of mobile devices increases and more IT users transition to public clouds, we believe our industry can and must do better than just holding the line on energy use. We can actually lower it, serving more users while using fewer resources.\nGoogle's energy consumption drives our biggest impact on the environment. Internally, we're focused on tackling it through a threefold strategy for carbon neutrality. Beyond Google, we've long been a vocal advocate for greening electrical grids worldwide. We support strong cleanenergy and climate-change policies committed to adding clean power to the grid, and we're partnering with governments and nongovernmental organizations to use Google technology to model the effects of climate change on both a global and a local level.\n\nOur approach\n\n8\n\fOur sustainability goals, like committing to match the electricity use for our operations with 100% renewable energy, not only are good for the environment but also make good business sense. By purchasing electricity from renewable sources like wind and solar, we can set a long-term fixed price for power. This allows us to gain access to an increasingly costcompetitive source of electricity, and it helps us save money in the long run. By the end of 2018, we had contracts to purchase more than 3.75 gigawatts (GW) of output from renewable energy projects. These contracts have led to nearly $5 billion in new capital investment in projects around the world.8\nWe're also working to incorporate a climate-resilience strategy into our operations that will enable our business and the communities we're part of to thrive despite the effects of climate change. The key principles that serve as the foundation for our strategy are focused on a people-centric framework that's robust, integrated, diverse, and designed with unique locations, scalability, and longevity in mind.9 This framework was used to conduct a climate exposure and vulnerability analysis that enabled us to assess the future resilience of our current locations and evaluate the climate resilience of new developments. Beyond our operations, Google's AI for Social Good program and Crisis Response platforms are using our technology to enhance flood forecasting models that provide predictions to inform individuals in affected areas so that they can better prepare and stay safe.\n\nCharleston Retention Basin on the edge of Google's campus in Mountain View, California\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nOur approach\n\n9\n\fOur goal is to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains and enable others to do the same.\n\nWater is another top priority. The United Nations predicts that by 2025, two-thirds of the world's population could live in water-stressed conditions, and with the existing climate change scenario, almost half the world's population will be living in areas of high water stress by 2030.10 As a global company headquartered in drought-prone California, we've established a set of water principles to guide our approach to water use and ensure business continuity, especially in the places where we have the greatest potential risk. Under these principles, we're working to utilize water efficiently, exploring ways to incorporate circularity, and engaging in partnerships that use Google technology to raise awareness of water-related risks and opportunities and to create platforms that help everyone study and understand global water challenges. Examples of sustainable water management practices can be seen in our data centers, where we keep working to find innovative cooling options where possible, like the use of seawater in Finland, industrial canal water in Belgium, and air cooling in Ireland. Through Google.org, we've awarded millions of dollars in grants to promising water-conservation solutions.11\nWe see the circular economy as a complex yet inspiring information challenge that, once unlocked, will lead to a world of abundance where human, environmental, and economic systems can thrive. That's why we're leveraging our scale, resources, technological expertise, and close partnerships with organizations like the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, as well as with other leading companies, to accelerate the transition to a circular economy and help the world meet its resource needs.\nUltimately, our goal is to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains and enable others to do the same. We're applying our circular economy principles to design out waste, keep products and materials in use, and promote healthy materials and safe chemistry. We strive to embed these principles across our infrastructure, operations, and products, from how we manage servers in our data centers to how we design our consumer electronics to the materials we select to build and furnish our offices. As we work toward this goal, we'll continue exploring the role of technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in accelerating our transition to becoming a circular Google that contributes to a sustainable world.\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nOur approach\n\n10\n\fFigure 1\nGOOGLE VALUE CHAIN\nEnergy\n\nSetting our priorities\nGoogle uses energy, natural resources, and products and services from our suppliers to build our workplaces, data centers, networking infrastructure, and consumer electronics. The software products and services that our customers and users rely on are powered by our data centers and networking infrastructure (see Figure 1). We're driving positive environmental impact throughout our value chain in five key ways: by designing efficient data centers, advancing carbon-free energy, creating sustainable workplaces, building better devices and services, and empowering users with technology.\nIn 2018, we undertook an assessment to identify and prioritize content for our environmental report that considered Google's impact on sustainability, the importance of environmental sustainability issues to our business strategy, and the perspectives of a diverse range of stakeholders outside of Google. The issue areas that were found to be of greatest relevance include our data centers, workplaces, users, water stewardship, circular economy strategy, and supply chain. Cutting across these priorities is the importance of engaging in public policy--at local, state, federal, and international levels-- to support the success of sustainable business models.\nAs per recommendations from the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, we have reported our exposure to climate-related risks over multiple time horizons in Alphabet's 2019 CDP Climate Change Report.\n\nOffices and Research/Development Sites\n\nConsumer Electronics and Services\n\nNatural Resources\n\nManufacturing, Construction, and\nServices\n\nData Centers and Networking Infrastructure\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform, G Suite Products, and Tools\n\nSuppliers and Communities\n\nEmployees and Communities Ecosystems\n\nCustomers and Users\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nOur approach\n\n11\n\fLooking toward future opportunities\nWe believe global businesses like Google should lead the way in improving people's lives, while reducing or even eliminating our dependence on raw materials and fossil fuels. And we believe this can be done in a way that makes business sense, providing economic returns alongside societal benefits and positive environmental impacts.\nPlanning for the future, we've established a five-year strategy that will enable us to continue building sustainability into everything we do (see Figure 2). Our strategy focuses on three key pillars: to accelerate the transition to carbon-free energy and a circular economy, to empower users with technology, and to benefit the people and places where we operate. We're continuing to work to decouple our business growth from the growth of material use and carbon intensity. This includes enhancing our net positive impact through initiatives that help our users reduce carbon emissions, save energy, and use resources more sustainably. We also want to ensure that Google products, tools, and platforms inform or enable sustainability, and that we're implementing practices to add value to our communities within and outside of Google.\nCreating Google tools that help people measure the planet's health and take action is a key part of our long-term strategy. Applications of machine learning (ML) and AI are increasingly enabling not only Google but also scientists and practitioners to create sustainable solutions and to turn data into insights and knowledge needed to guide better decision-making. We're excited to continue exploring how these technologies and applications can be used to create a more sustainable future for generations to come--and we're committed to using these technologies in a responsible way.12\nFigure 2\nFIVE-YEAR SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY OVERVIEW\nWe strive to build sustainability into everything we do\n\nAccelerate carbon-free and circular\nDecouple business growth from growth of carbon\nintensity and material use\n\nEmpower with technology\nGoogle products, tools, and platforms inform or enable sustainability\n\nBenefit people and places\nShare benefits with communities where we operate\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nOur approach\n\n12\n\fPerformance highlights and targets\nThe following section includes highlights of the environmental initiatives discussed in this report.

We own and operate 15 data centers13 on four continents and continue to add new sites to better serve our customers. Each data center is a large campus where the vast majority of our facilities, servers, networking equipment, and cooling systems are designed from the ground up for maximum efficiency and minimal environmental impact.\nFor more than a decade, we've worked to make Google data centers some of the most efficient in the world, improving their environmental performance even as demand for our products has dramatically risen. We've done this by designing, building, and operating each one to maximize efficient use of energy, water, and materials.\nTo reduce energy use, we strive to build the world's most energy-efficient computing network by squeezing more out of every watt of power we consume. First, we outfit each data center with high-performance servers that we've custom designed to use as little energy as possible. We improve facility energy use by installing smart temperature and lighting controls and redesigning how power is distributed to reduce energy loss. We employ advanced cooling techniques, relying primarily on energy-efficient evaporative cooling, and use nonpotable water at some sites. Finally, we're applying machine learning to drive energy efficiency even further.\nOur efforts have paid off: On average, a Google data center is twice as energy efficient as a typical enterprise data center.15 Compared with five years ago, we now deliver around seven times as much computing power with the same amount of electrical power. Much of this improvement has come from new innovations with accelerators, such as our Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)--highly efficient computer chips we designed specifically for machine learning applications.\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nDesigning efficient data centers\n\n19\n\fIn 2018, the average annual power usage effectiveness (PUE)16 for our global fleet of data centers was 1.11, compared with the industry average of 1.6717-- meaning that Google data centers use about six times less overhead energy (11%) for every unit of IT equipment energy (see Figure 3). We aim to maintain or improve our quarterly PUE at each Google data center, year over year. Our fleet-wide PUE has stayed at or below 1.12 since 2013 (see Figure 4).\nGenerating electricity requires water, so the less energy we use to power our data centers, the less water we use as well. The source of energy matters too: Wind and solar energy require considerably less water to produce than do coal and nuclear energy. In 2018, matching our data center electricity consumption with renewable energy reduced embedded water use by 88% on average compared with buying grid power.\n\nFigure 3\nOVERHEAD ENERGY USE IN GOOGLE DATA CENTERS l Overhead energy as % of IT energy\n-- 20\n\n-- 15\n\n11%\n\n-- 10\n\n0\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nPUE PERCENT\n\nFigure 4\nAVERAGE PUE FOR ALL DATA CENTERS Quarterly PUE Trailing 12-month (TTM) PUE\n1.26 --\n\n1.22 --\n\n1.18 --\n\n1.14 --\n\n1.10 --\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n1.11 1.11\n2019\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nDesigning efficient data centers\n\n20\n\fGoogle's data center in Saint-Ghislain, Belgium\nIn 2013, we became the first company in North America--and the only major internet company--to achieve a multi-site energy management system certification to ISO 50001, a voluntary third-party standard. Our energy management system intends to cover all of our owned data centers globally once they meet certain operational milestones. In 2018, we maintained ISO 50001 certification for 12 of our 15 Google-owned and -operated data centers, which together represented 91% of our IT energy use.18\nWe're also working to design out waste, embedding circular economy principles into our server management by reusing materials multiple times. In 2018, 19% of components used for machine upgrades were refurbished inventory. When we can't find a new use for our equipment, we completely erase any components that stored data and then resell them. In 2018, we resold nearly 3.5 million units into the secondary market for reuse by other organizations.\nWe're committed to achieving Zero Waste to Landfill19 for our global data center operations by reducing the amount of waste we generate and finding better disposal options. In 2018, we diverted 87% of waste from our global data center operations away from landfills.\nIn addition to driving efficiency in our data center operations, we also consider supply chain impacts. Through the efforts of our Responsible Supply Chain program, we collaborate with stakeholders across our supply chain to uphold our high standards for protecting workers and the environment.\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nDesigning efficient data centers\n\n21\n\fFrom 2007 to 2017, Google's data center investments in Europe supported economic activity with\n490\nmillion per year in GDP.\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nOur Supplier Code of Conduct builds upon Google's core values and beliefs and incorporates key elements from the Google Code of Conduct and international human rights, safety, and environmental standards.\nGoogle has saved more than $1 billion through our energy-efficiency initiatives and hundreds of millions more through resource efficiency. By sharing our best practices and supporting research and collaboration, we hope to help other companies realize their own savings and promote ever-greater data center sustainability worldwide.\nGoogle's investment in digital infrastructure, such as data centers, also supports sustainable growth and creates economic opportunity. In 2016, Google's U.S. data centers generated $1.3 billion in economic activity, $750 million in labor income, and 11,000 jobs.20 From 2007 to 2017, Google's data center investments in Europe supported economic activity with 490 million per year in gross domestic product (GDP) and 6,600 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs per year, on average.21\nCarbon-neutral cloud services\nGoogle Cloud Platform and G Suite products like Gmail, Docs, and Drive are enabling millions of businesses to shift computing needs from self-managed data centers or colocation facilities to Google Cloud's highly efficient, renewable energybased computing infrastructure. Businesses that switch to cloud-based products like G Suite have reported reductions in IT energy use and carbon emissions up to 87%,22 and a business using Gmail can reduce the GHG emissions impact of its email service by up to 98%, compared with running email via onpremises servers.23 Individual users also benefit, since providing an active user one month of Google services creates fewer GHG emissions than driving a car one mile.24 Whether someone is using Google at home or as part of an organization running Google Cloud or G Suite, all of the products in our Cloud are carbon neutral.\nLEARN MORE 2016 case study: Circular Economy at Work in Google Data Centers 2018 spotlight: Once Is Never Enough 2018 spotlight: Putting Down Local Roots Where Google's European Data Centers Are Growing 2018 spotlight: Belgian site becomes first Google data center to add on-site solar 2018 blog: Engineered for renewal: Google Cloud, Etsy and sustainability 2018 report: European Data Centers: Economic Impact and Community Benefit 2018 report: U.S. Data Centers: Economic Impact and Community Benefit Website: Google Data Centers: Efficiency: How We Do It Website: Google Cloud Sustainability Website: Google Cloud Renewable Energy Website: Responsible Supply Chain\n\nDesigning efficient data centers\n\n22\n\fSpotlight\nAutomated AI takes Google data center efficiency to next level\nIn 2016, we jointly developed an AI-powered recommendation system to improve the energy efficiency of Google's already highly-optimized data centers. Now we're taking this system to the next level: instead of humanimplemented recommendations, our AI system is directly controlling data center cooling, while remaining under the expert supervision of our data center operators. This first-of-its-kind cloud-based control system is now safely delivering energy savings in multiple Google data centers.\nWhereas our original recommendation system had operators vetting and implementing actions, our new AI control system directly implements the actions. We've purposefully constrained the system's optimization boundaries to a narrower operating regime to prioritize safety and reliability, meaning there is a risk/reward trade off in terms of energy reductions.\nDespite being in place for only a matter of months, the system is already delivering consistent energy savings of around 30 percent on average, with further expected improvements. That's because these systems get better over time with more data. Our direct AI control system is finding yet more novel ways to manage cooling that have surprised even the data center operators. Dan Fuenffinger, one of Google's data center operators who has worked extensively alongside the system, remarked: \"It was amazing to see the AI learn to take advantage of winter conditions and produce colder than normal water, which reduces the energy required for cooling within the data center. Rules don't get better over time, but AI does.\"\nWe're excited that our direct AI control system is operating safely and dependably, while consistently delivering energy savings. However, data centers are just the beginning. In the long term, we think there's potential to apply this technology in other industrial settings, and help tackle climate change on an even grander scale.

And combating climate change requires the world to transition to a clean energy economy. So we've made it a top priority to become more energy efficient and to match every unit of energy we consume at our facilities around the world with an equivalent unit of energy from renewable sources, such as wind and solar. Our support for clean energy goes hand in hand with reducing our carbon footprint. By improving the efficiency of our operations and buying both renewable power and high-quality carbon offsets, we've been carbon neutral since 2007.\nGoogle is the world's largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy.25 Since 2010, we've signed 34 agreements to purchase a total of more than 3.75 GW of renewable energy that is new to the grid (see Figure 5).26 On July 27, 2015, as part of the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, Google committed to tripling our purchases of renewable energy from 1.1 GW to 3.4 GW by 2025. We surpassed this in 2018, exceeding our target seven years early.\nIn 2012, we set a long-term goal to purchase enough renewable energy to match all the electricity we consume globally on an annual basis. In 2017, we achieved it for the first time: Google's total purchase of energy from sources like wind and solar matched the amount of electricity used by our operations around the world, including our offices and data centers. And in 2018, we again matched 100% of our annual electricity consumption with purchases of renewable energy (see Figure 6). This amounted to more than 10 million megawatt-hours (MWh) of energy--more electricity than is used annually by the state of Hawaii.27 To date, we've purchased a total of nearly 26 million MWh of renewable energy.\nWe're the first company of our size to achieve 100% renewable energy two years running.28 While we're still drawing power from the grid, some of which is from fossil fuel resources, we're purchasing enough renewable energy to match every MWh of electricity our data center and office operations consume.\nOur long-term goal is to source carbon-free energy to match our electricity consumption in all places, at all times. This means realizing a future where each Google facility is always matched--around the clock--with local carbon-free power. Our ultimate vision is to create a world where everyone has access to clean energy; this includes not only Google, but our suppliers and their communities.\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\n\n25\n\fMidAmerican Energy Wind VIII 407 MW\nStory County II 114 MW\nCimarron Bend 200 MW\n\nGolden Hills 43 MW\nBluestem 198 MW\n\n400 MW 200 MW 100 MW\n\nBethel 225 MW\n\nDakota Range 300 MW\nCoyote Ridge 98 MW\nTatanka 98 MW\nGlaciers Edge 200 MW\nDuke Rider 75 MW\nCanadian Hills 48 MW\n\nMaevaara l Maevaara ll\n\n72 MW\n\n33 MW\n\nTellenes\n\nLehtirova 103 MW\nJenasen 76 MW\n\nKuuronkallio 60 MW\nHedet 81 MW\n\n160 MW\nWindpark Krammer 26 MW\n\nBeaufort 76 MW\nEolus 62 MW\n\nLakiakangas 50 MW\n\nBouwdokken 9 MW\n\nDelfzijl 63 MW\n\nSunport 31 MW\n\nYum Yum 147 MW\n\nBellefonte 150 MW\nRed Dirt\n\nGreat Western Minco ll 139 MW Georgia Power C&I\n\n225 MW\n\n101 MW\n\n79 MW\n\nWind\n\nSolar\n\nTaiyen 10 MW\n\nEl Romero 80 MW\n\nFrom 2010 to 2018, Google signed 34 agreements to purchase more than 3.75 GW of renewable energy that is new to the grid.\n\nFigure 5\nRENEWABLE ENERGY FOR GOOGLE'S OPERATIONS\n\nReaching 100% renewable energy\nWe achieved our 100% renewable energy target much faster and at much greater scale than we thought possible when we set this goal seven years ago. We met it primarily by buying renewable electricity directly from new wind and solar farms via long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) on the grids where we have operations, as well as by buying renewable power through utilities via renewable energy purchasing models that we helped create. In addition, a portion of our utility energy purchases include renewable sources as part of the utility's grid mix.29 With our PPAs, we're purchasing physical renewable energy, which includes the electrons bundled with renewable energy certificates (RECs).\nBy pioneering new energy purchasing models that others can follow, we've helped drive wide-scale adoption of clean energy. For example, we joined forces with Walmart, Target, and Johnson & Johnson in Georgia to help build a state-approved program that allows companies to buy renewable energy directly through the state's largest utility. The program is the first of its kind in Georgia and has paved the way for construction of two solar energy projects with a total capacity of 177 megawatts (MW).\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\n\n26\n\fGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nAlso in the Southeast region of the United States, we worked with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to sign a utility-based agreement where Google will purchase the output of several new solar farms, totaling 413 MW of power from 1.6 million solar panels-- equivalent to the combined size of 65,000 home rooftop solar systems. Thanks to the abundant solar power generated by these new farms, electricity consumed by our new data centers under construction in Tennessee and Alabama will be matched with 100% renewable energy from day one.\nOur efforts to expand carbon-free energy in 2018 also took us to Europe, where we announced agreements in Finland to purchase additional renewable electricity from three new wind farms totaling 190 MW--our first such deals in the country.\nOur renewable energy initiatives earned Google two 2018 Green Power Leadership Awards: one in International Market Development from the Center for Resource Solutions and one in Excellence in Green Power Use from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\nDeepMind and Google recently started using machine learning (ML) to make wind power more predictable and valuable. We used ML to optimize 700 MW of wind power capacity in the Central United States that is part of our global fleet of renewable energy projects. By predicting wind power output 36 hours ahead of actual generation, our model recommends how\nFigure 6\nRENEWABLE ENERGY PURCHASING COMPARED WITH TOTAL ELECTRICITY USE\nTotal electricity consumption (TWh) Renewable energy %\n-- 10 100%\n-- 8 100%\n-- 6\n\nELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION (TWh)\n\n-- 4\n\n61%\n\n48%\n\n-- 2\n\n37% 34% 35%\n0 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\n\n27\n\fMinco II wind farm in Oklahoma (101 MW for Google)\n\nto make optimal hourly delivery commitments to the power grid a full day in advance. This is important because energy sources that can be scheduled (i.e., can deliver a set amount of electricity at a set time) are often more valuable to the grid. To date, ML has boosted the value of our wind energy by roughly 20%, compared to the baseline scenario of no time-based commitments to the grid.\nWe're also helping to green the power grid through our advocacy of clean energy policies and our support for renewable energy procurement programs. For example, we worked with business and government stakeholders in Taiwan to share our experience with the benefits of corporate renewable energy purchasing and to support the creation of new purchasing channels for companies. We were pleased to see that Taiwan passed a law in January 2017 to allow end-users to directly purchase renewable energy for their operations. In 2018, we signed our inaugural renewable energy deal in Asia, the first such corporate power purchase agreement in Taiwan. We will purchase the output of a 10 MW solar array (which is part of a larger solar farm) in Tainan City, Taiwan. It will deploy 40,000 solar panels across commercial fishing ponds, maximizing land-use efficiency and benefiting local aquaculture workers. This will boost the carbon-free profile of our local data center.\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\n\n28\n\fTo date, Google's renewable energy purchasing contracts have led to nearly\n$5 billion\nin new capital investment in renewable energy projects around the world.\n\nAlong with being the world's largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy, Google is also one of the world's largest corporate investors in renewable energy. Since 2010, we've committed to invest nearly $2.5 billion in large-scale renewable energy projects and residential solar rooftop funds with a total combined capacity of 3.7 GW.30 These targeted investments go beyond our own operational footprint, enabling renewable energy deployment at a larger scale while generating attractive risk-adjusted returns.\nThe cost of renewable power has dropped precipitously, while its scale has grown dramatically. Since 2009, levelized costs for utility-scale wind and solar energy have decreased by 69% and 88%, respectively.31 In 2015, wind and solar energy became the world's largest source of newly installed power capacity,32 and in 2018, 65% of net new power capacity globally came from renewable energy.33 Renewables have become a mainstream source of affordable electricity for millions of people.\nIncreasing the share of renewables on the grid will produce many positive impacts. For example, doubling renewables by 2030 is expected to increase global GDP by as much as 1.1%, improve global welfare by 3.7%, and employ more than 24 million people in the renewable energy sector.34 To date, Google's renewable energy purchasing contracts have led to nearly $5 billion in new capital investment in renewable energy projects around the world.35 At Google, we'll continue doing our best to help accelerate the transition to clean energy and a more prosperous future.\nLEARN MORE 2016 white paper: Achieving Our 100% Renewable Energy Purchasing Goal and Going Beyond 2016 spotlight: Greening the Grid: How Google Buys Renewable Energy 2018 blog post: Meeting Our Match: Buying 100 Percent Renewable Energy 2018 spotlight: Unlocking Access to Corporate Renewable Energy Purchasing in Taiwan 2018 blog post: A new partnership to drive renewable energy growth in the U.S. 2018 blog post: New wind in Finland: Scaling renewable energy as we grow 2018 blog post: The Internet is 24x7.

Every year since 2009, we've publicly reported the results to CDP, a global organization that asks companies to disclose information on their GHG emissions performance and management. Our report received an A score from CDP for the past five years, and for the past four years, we earned a spot on CDP's Climate A List, which recognizes top reporting companies.\nIn 2018, our gross Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions were 4.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), but because of our renewable energy purchases, our net GHG emissions were reduced by 3.7 million tons to 750 thousand tCO2e (see Figures 7 and 8). Due to growth in our business, our operational emissions increased 30% over the past year.36 After accounting for our carbon offset purchases, our net operational carbon emissions were zero.\nSince 2011, our renewable energy purchasing has resulted in emissions savings of nearly 11 million tCO2e--a cumulative 52% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions over this period (see Figure 9). This is equivalent to taking nearly 2.3 million cars off the road for a year, or the carbon sequestered by more than 12.5 million acres of U.S. forests in a year.37 In 2018, our operational GHG emissions were 83% lower due to our renewable energy procurement (see Figure 9).\n\nFigure 7\n\nFigure 8\n\nGHG EMISSIONS WITHOUT RENEWABLE\n\nGHG EMISSIONS WITH RENEWABLE\n\nENERGY PURCHASES\n\nENERGY PURCHASES\n\n-- 6\n\n4.9\n-- 4\n\nMILLION tCO2e\n\n-- 2\n1.2\n\n0\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nScope 1 Scope 2 (location) Scope 2 (market) Scope 3 (business travel and commuting)38 Total location-based GHG emissions Total market-based GHG emissions\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\n\n30\n\fMILLION tCO2e\n\nFigure 9\nIMPACT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY PURCHASES ON GHG EMISSIONS\nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (without renewable energy) Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (with renewable energy)\n\n5 -- 4 -- 3 --\n2 -- 1 -- 0\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n4.4\n0.75\n2018\n\nFigure 10\nCARBON INTENSITY PER UNIT OF REVENUE\nCarbon intensity Total revenues\n\n40 -- 35 -- 30 -- 25 -- 20 -- 15 -- 10 -- 0\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n136.8 -- 150\n\n-- 120\n\n-- 90\n\n-- 60\n\n5.5\n\n2017\n\n30 2018\n\nBILLION US$\n\ntCO2e /BILLION US$\n\nFigure 11\nCARBON INTENSITY PER FTE EMPLOYEE\n\nCarbon intensity Average number of FTE employees 60 --\n\n50 --\n\n40 -- 30 --\n\n20 -- 10 --\n\n0 2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\ntCO2e /FTE\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n-- 100\n89.5\n-- 80\n-- 60\n-- 40\n8.4\n20 2018\n31\n\nTHOUSAND FTEs\n\fDelfzijl wind farm in the Netherlands (63 MW for Google)\n\nTo align with industry best practices for Scope 3 reporting, in 2018, we extended our boundaries to include manufacturing emissions beyond Tier 1 suppliers (full upstream to the point of extraction), use of sold products, end-of-life treatment of sold products, and emissions associated with food from our corporate offices.

For example, our vision is for all our suppliers' sites to source 100% renewable energy in every region where our products are made.\nBecause of our emissions-reduction efforts, our carbon intensity has steadily decreased even as our company has grown and our energy use has correspondingly increased. Since 2011, our carbon intensity per unit of revenue decreased by 86% (see Figure 10), our carbon intensity39 per FTE employee decreased by 84% (see Figure 11), and our carbon intensity for electricity used at our data centers dropped by 91%. This means we're delivering our products and services with reduced carbon impacts, even before using carbon offsets to reach neutrality.\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\n\n32\n\fWells capture methane gas at Oneida-Herkimer Regional Landfill in New York.\nTwelve years of carbon neutrality\nIn 2007, Google committed to being carbon neutral, and we've met this goal every year since then. We reach carbon neutrality via three steps. First, we work to reduce our total energy consumption by pursuing aggressive energyefficiency initiatives. Second, we match 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations with purchases of renewable energy. Third, we buy carbon offsets for any remaining emissions we haven't yet eliminated.40\nWhen we committed to carbon neutrality, we saw carbon offsets as an interim solution. As we work to reduce our emissions, our need for carbon offsets will continue to decrease. We reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by improving energy efficiency and procuring renewable energy. We reduce our operational Scope 3 emissions by minimizing the need for business travel through encouraging use of video conferencing tools like Google Hangouts for meetings, and facilitating employees to use sustainable commuting options for employees, such as public transit, shuttles, carpooling, or electric vehicles.\nWhen we do purchase carbon offsets, we follow stringent principles. We invest in high-quality, third-party-verified offsets, including landfill gas projects and animal waste management systems. All our offsets are additional, meaning that the projects reduce GHG emissions that wouldn't\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\n\n33\n\fWe will continue\nto work toward\nnet zero\ncarbon in the decade\nto come and to increase\nthe net positive impact\nof our products.\n\nbe reduced through other incentives. We also ensure that the projects we invest in are permanent sources of carbon reduction or sequestration, rather than temporary solutions. Finally, whenever possible, we invest for the long term, which offers owners and developers the financial stability they need to continue operating.\nGoogle has been carbon neutral for twelve years, and in that time, we've partnered with more than 40 carbon offset projects to offset more than 19 million tCO2e.41 One of Google's long-standing project partners is OneidaHerkimer Solid Waste Management Authority, a landfill gas project in upstate New York, United States. By enabling us to reduce our carbon footprint while reducing local air pollution, improving waste management, and increasing local revenue streams, each of these collaborations is a win for both Google and our communities.\nOur commitment to reduce GHG emissions goes beyond our operational boundaries; some of our products enable users to reduce their own GHG emissions. For example, Google Maps and Waze Carpool help commuters reduce emissions by making transit and carpooling information more accessible. Nest thermostats help people reduce home energy consumption by controlling heating and cooling. And Project Sunroof helps users estimate potential solar energy production if they were to install rooftop solar. We will continue to work toward net zero carbon in the decade to come and to increase the net positive impact of our products.\nLEARN MORE 2011 white paper: Google's Carbon Offsets: Collaboration and Due Diligence 2017 white paper: 10 Years of Carbon Neutrality 2017 spotlight: Capturing Value from Waste in Upstate New York Website: Responsible Supply Chain\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\n\n34\n\fSpotlight\nThe Internet is 24x7--carbonfree energy should be too\nElectricity is the fuel that allows our data centers to deliver billions of Google searches, YouTube views, and much more--every single day, around the clock. For the past two years, we matched 100% of our electricity consumption with purchases of renewable energy.\nAs exciting as this milestone was, it was only the first step toward a much more ambitious, long-term challenge: to source carbon-free energy to match our electricity consumption in all places, at all times. This means realizing a future where each Google facility is always matched--around the clock-- with local carbon-free power.\nIn October 2018, we published an inside look at the sources of Google's electricity around the globe, to gauge how we're tracking toward our longterm aspiration of sourcing 24x7 carbon-free energy. We shared locationspecific \"Carbon Heat Maps\" to visualize how well a data center is matched with carbon-free energy on an hour-by-hour basis.\nSome of our data centers--like the one in Hamina, Finland--are already performing remarkably well: 97% of the facility's electricity use last year was matched with carbon-free sources. Others still have room to improve.\nCreating a carbon-free future will not be easy. It will require innovations across policy, technology, and business models. But the urgency of climate change demands bold solutions. \"We're keeping our eyes on the prize,\" says Michael Terrell, director of operations at Google. \"And that's making carbon-free power the status quo.\" Read how we're taking steps toward a 24x7 carbon-free future\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nMinco II wind farm in Oklahoma (101 MW for Google)\n\nAdvancing carbon-free energy\n\n35\n\fCreating sustainable workplaces\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\n36\n\fSUSTAINABLE WORKPLACES: BY THE NUMBERS\n13 million\nsquare feet LEED-certified\nBy the end of 2018, over 1.2 million square meters (13 million square feet) of Google office facilities had achieved LEED certification.\n76%\nlandfill diversion\nIn 2018, we reached a 76% landfill diversion rate for our offices globally.\n6.6 million\npounds of food waste prevented\nSince 2014, Google has prevented over 3 million kilograms (6.6 million pounds) of pre-consumer food waste in our cafs globally.\n40,000\ntCO2e savings\nBy using Google shuttles in the Bay Area in 2018, we saved 40,000 tCO2e emissions-- equivalent to taking 8,760 cars off the road every work day.\n\nOverview\nAmericans spend roughly 90% of their time indoors, and much of that time is spent at work.42 At Google, just as we focus on people when it comes to designing our products, we also focus on people when creating healthy and sustainable workplaces--from our Bay Area headquarters to our offices in more than 150 cities spanning over 50 countries around the world. To do so, we look for innovative ideas that deliver measurable results and can be implemented at scale.\nWe start by applying industry-leading green building standards wherever possible. Our ongoing goal is to pursue third-party green or healthy-building certifications for our office projects, such as LEED, WELL Building Standard, and Living Building Challenge. By the end of 2018, over 1.2 million square meters (13 million square feet) of Google office facilities had achieved LEED certification, with 28% of our LEED-certified square footage achieving a Platinum rating and 57% a Gold rating (see Figure 12).\nAs part of our carbon neutral strategy, we continually pursue energy efficiency initiatives to reduce our energy consumption. In 2011, our Google office in New York City committed to the NYC Carbon Challenge--a voluntary, public-private partnership with the mayor's office in which organizations strive for a 30% reduction in GHG emissions per FTE by 2030. After meeting the 30% reduction goal early, we committed to a 50% reduction goal by 2025.43 By the end of 2018, we had already met our target seven years ahead of schedule--reducing GHG emissions by 54% per FTE at our New York City office--primarily due to various energy efficiency and emissions reductions projects.\nWe also have a strong focus on the impacts associated with material selection, production, transportation, use, serviceability, and recycling of the products used for our spaces. We work to ensure that these products are safe for humans and the environment throughout their life cycles. We believe an industry-wide transition to safe chemistry and healthy materials is on the horizon. But making safe chemistry and healthy materials the new norm will require collective action across sectors, increased access to high-quality data that assesses chemical hazards, demand signals (from buyers like Google) to material and product manufacturers, and advancements in recycling technology and infrastructure.\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nCreating sustainable workplaces\n\n37\n\fGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nFigure 12\nCUMULATIVE LEED-CERTIFIED OFFICE SPACE\nl Certified & Silver l Gold l Platinum\n\n-- 1.2M\n\n-- 0.9M\n\nSQUARE METERS\n\n-- 0.6M\n\n-- 0.3M\n\n0 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\nConsidering local environments\nWe take a science- and community-driven approach to managing our campuses, with the aim of having a positive impact in the places where we operate and of designing and building our offices with local environments, ecology, and animal habitats in mind. One example is the thriving egret rookery in the middle of our Mountain View, California, campus. Since 2013, the Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society (SCVAS) and Google have worked together to provide conservation guidance and educational programming for the nesting area. Conservation efforts include limiting vehicular traffic during the breeding season, establishing a protocol for collecting and caring for injured and orphaned egrets, and installing signage. Additionally, the SCVAS organizes \"Egret Office Hours,\" attracting hundreds of Googlers, community members, North Bayshore company employees, nature enthusiasts, school groups, and others to learn about the rookery.\nAnother example is our science-based Design Guidelines for Bay Area landscaping projects. By the end of 2018, we had implemented our Habitat Design Guidelines on over 100 acres across our Bay Area headquarters. Areas once defined by lawn and hedges now host vibrant colonies of California wildflowers teeming with native bees and butterflies. These areas are studied and monitored to help inform future design decisions.\n\nCreating sustainable workplaces\n\n38\n\fGoogle's offices are designed with people and the planet in mind.\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nSustainability in our offices\nWe reduce our water footprint by installing water-saving technologies and using reclaimed water wherever possible. In 2018, we set a target to reduce potable water intensity at our Bay Area headquarters by 5% by 2019. We're on track to meet this target: By the end of 2018, we achieved a 3% reduction in potable water intensity--equivalent to avoiding the use of over 42 million liters (11 million gallons) of potable water. Our current approach to global goal setting focuses on the highest-impact opportunities. We're now targeting our work at Google offices in highly water-stressed locations and in offices that are supported by recycling and composting infrastructure.\nWe implement strategies to minimize contamination in our office waste streams and identify diversion pathways that keep the waste we do generate out of landfills. In 2018, we reached 76% landfill diversion for our offices globally, and we surpassed our target to reduce landfill waste per Googler by 10% at our Bay Area headquarters--achieving a 15% reduction in landfill waste per Googler by the end of 2018. We also tracked waste generation for global offices that represent 53% of Google's total headcount.\nOur cafs and Food Spots offer nutritious, responsibly sourced meals, snacks, and beverages.44 We make thoughtful choices in the products we buy and the suppliers we buy them from. Our sustainability priorities include food waste prevention, sustainable hydration initiatives that encourage the use of reusable vessels for drinking water, and the promotion of balanced,\n\nCreating sustainable workplaces\n\n39\n\fplant-forward offerings--all of which help reduce our environmental impact and support human health and well-being. We constantly come up with inventive solutions to repurpose food and look to compost and donate leftovers wherever we're legally able to do so, but we've learned that the best way to reduce food waste is to prevent it in the first place by tracking data and making adjustments. In 2018, this sort of data-driven optimization helped Google prevent more than 1 million kilograms (2.25 million pounds) of pre-consumer food waste in our cafs around the world, totaling over 3 million kilograms (6.6 million pounds) of food waste prevented since 2014. Also, by the end of 2018, 12 of our top 25 office sites were on track to reduce single-use beverages per seated headcount by 20% relative to a 2017 baseline.\nOur Transportation team plans, implements, and operates mobility solutions to support Google's global growth. We set ambitious goals for helping Googlers transition to shuttles, carpooling, public transit, biking, and walking. There are also a growing number of electric vehicles in our Google-owned and -operated commuter program fleet, with the majority of the nonelectric vehicles using renewable diesel. In 2018, our Bay Area headquarters remained on track to meet our long-term goal of reducing single-occupancy vehicle commuting to 45%. We also have a target to provide electric vehicle charging stations for 10% of total parking spaces at our Bay Area headquarters. To date, we're on track to incorporate this design standard for new construction and tenant improvement projects and we've installed more than 2,700 electric vehicle charging ports at our offices in the United States.

Our Bay Area headquarters and many of our global offices host annual events to celebrate Earth Day and World Environment Day, where we share how Googlers can be sustainable on campus, at home, and in their communities. We also host an annual employee recognition program to recognize Googlers around the world who are driving sustainability across the company. The award winners are selected by members of our executive leadership team and are invited to attend an internal awards ceremony. Throughout the year we also invite thought leaders and experts to speak on the latest trends, achievements, and challenges related to sustainability, some of which are posted on the Talks at Google YouTube channel.\nOur employees constantly reinvigorate our determination to build a better future. As we continue to explore sustainability strategies, we're committed to sharing what we learn with other companies to help foster the growth of more productive, environmentally friendly businesses.\nLEARN MORE 2018 case study: The Role of Safe Chemistry and Healthy Materials in Unlocking the Circular Economy 2018 case study: Seeding Resilience with Ecology 2018 spotlight: Ecologically focused landscapes are coming to life on Google campuses 2018 blog post: Every summer, Google's campus is for the birds YouTube channel: Talks at Google\n\nGooglers explore different booths at Google Environment Day.\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nCreating sustainable workplaces\n\n41\n\fSpotlight\nThe journey toward healthier materials\nIf you want to construct a building that's healthier for people and the planet, the solution seems simple: Choose healthy materials made from safe chemistry. But, if you don't have information to understand what's healthier, where do you start?\nThat's the challenge we took on several years ago with the launch of our Healthy Materials Program. A natural extension of Google's belief in using data to shed light and inform decision-making, the program is intended to fill the information gap between common building materials and the safety of the chemicals used to make them.\nMore broadly, we hope to lead the market toward safer chemistry and healthier materials. We'll do this through increased transparency and by continuing to use our purchasing power to underscore that material health is as important as budget and availability in the decision-making process.\nWe're currently focusing our approach to build on our successes and the lessons we've learned. Our next step is to empower everyone to join the healthy materials movement by sharing what we know.\n\"For healthy materials to be on every shelf in every hardware store in every corner of the world, we need thousands of companies doing this with us,\" says Robin Bass, who leads the Sustainability Programs Team for Google's Real Estate and Workplace Services. \"The more people that demand healthier materials, the more we move the needle.\" Read how we're laying the groundwork for a safer and healthier future\nOur Healthy Materials Program has made building spaces healthier for Googlers.\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nCreating sustainable workplaces\n\n42\n\fBuilding better devices and services\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\n43\n\fDEVICES AND SERVICES: BY THE NUMBERS\n29billion\nkWh of energy savings\nNest thermostats have helped customers cumulatively save more than 29 billion kWh of energy--nearly three times as much energy as Google used in 2018.\n10%15%\nenergy savings\nOn average, Nest thermostats have proven energy savings of 10%12% for heating and 15% for cooling, which means they pay for themselves in under two years.\n20%75%\nrecycled plastic\nProducts like the Nest Thermostat E, Google Home, and Chromecast all contain parts with 20%75% post-consumer recycled plastic content.\n1 million\nNest thermostats\nThe Nest Power Project aims to bring 1 million energy- and money-saving Nest thermostats to families in need by 2023.\n\nOverview\nAt Google, we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. And, now that our business includes building consumer hardware, our commitment remains the same. Our ambition is that every product we build will leave people, the planet, and our communities better than we found them. We're at the start of a journey of reimagining how even better devices and consumer hardware experiences are created.\nAlthough we've been making some consumer devices for a while, Google's consumer hardware product area was formed just over three years ago. We're working to integrate sustainability into our products, operations, and communities--making it not just an aspect of how we do business but the centerpiece of it. This is an ongoing endeavor that involves designing in sustainability from the start and embedding it into the entire product development process and across our operations, all while creating the products our customers want.\nTo help us get a step closer to reaching our goals, in 2019 we shared a set of sustainability commitments for hardware devices and services. By 2020, 100% of all shipments going to or from customers will be carbon neutral. By 2022, 100% of Made by Google products will include recycled materials, with a drive to maximize recycled content whenever possible. And we're committed to making technology that puts people first and expands access to the benefits of technology.\nLooking ahead, we know there's more work to be done. We'll continue working to design energy-efficient products. We'll continue working to extend the useful life of our products by making them more serviceable. And we'll continue ensuring that our products are accessible for as many people as possible. We're excited about the direction we're headed.\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nBuilding better devices and services\n\n44\n\fSome of Google's consumer hardware products: Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3, Google Home Mini, Google Nest Hub, and Google Home\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nConsumer devices\nOver the past few years, we've been steadily growing our family of great consumer hardware products. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful, make your life easier, and get better over time by combining the best of Google's AI, software, and hardware. This is reflected in our latest generation of hardware products like Pixel 3 phones and the Google Nest Hub smart display. Creating beautiful products that people rely on every day is a journey that we're investing in for the long run, and one we want to do in a sustainable way.\nIn 2018, we launched a suite of new products, including the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL phones, Google Pixel Slate, Google Nest Hub, Google Clips, Google Nest Hello Doorbell, Google Nest Temperature Sensor, Nest x Yale Lock, Titan Security Key, and Chromecast. Other products we offer include Google Home, Google Home Max, Google Home Mini, and Google Pixelbook. We hold ourselves to the highest environmental standards and strive to ensure that Google products are designed, manufactured, and disposed of in a sustainable way. This applies to how we think about materials, manufacturing processes, energy efficiency, and packaging.\nWe're laying the foundation for what we believe will be a way of doing business that commits to building better products and services. Google has a company-level goal to increase the sustainability and circularity of our consumer electronic products, operations, and communities. We've made good progress so far, and we have great momentum.\n\nBuilding better devices and services\n\n45\n\fIn 2018 alone, Nest thermostats helped customers save nearly\n12 billion\nkWh of energy--more energy than Google used this year.\n\nFor most devices, in 2018 we began publishing product environmental reports, which help people understand the sustainability attributes of our products. Each product environmental report provides an overview of that device's environmental impact in areas such as material composition, life cycle GHG emissions, and energy efficiency. Starting in 2020, we'll publish product environmental reports for all of the flagship products we launch.\nWe consider sustainability throughout the entire life cycle of a device, including its production, transportation, use, and end of life. Our product life cycle assessments give us insight into our largest opportunities for reducing the environmental impact of a given product. For example, GHG emissions from shipping are an important contributor to the environmental impact of our products. From 2017 to 2018, we reduced carbon emissions for product shipments by 40% per unit, on average, by shifting many devices from air to ocean shipping.\nWe want to ensure that the materials and substances used for our products are safe for people and the environment, can be reused to create future products, and retain economic value. One of the keys to unlocking the circular economy is safer chemistry from the start, so in 2017, we published our Restricted Substances Specification to ensure the use of safer materials across our products.\nWe support greener electronics standards and certifications, including UL 110, IEEE 1680.1, and the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT).45 We strive for the highest rating available for applicable products within available product categories. We've achieved EPEAT Gold registration for all current models of the Pixel 3 phone.46\nWe also strive to make our products as energy-efficient as possible. For example, the 2018 Google Pixelbook incorporates power-management software to reduce energy consumption during use. This allowed it to attain ENERGY STAR certification, which means it has energy performance among the top 25% of similar products of its type. And in 2018 alone, Nest thermostats helped customers save nearly 12 billion kWh of energy--more energy than Google used in 2018.\nTo accelerate the transition to a circular economy, it's critical to create demand for recycled materials. To date, we've shipped millions of devices made with post-consumer recycled plastic. Products like the Nest Thermostat E, Google Home, and Chromecast all contain parts with 20% 75% post-consumer recycled plastic content.\nCaption\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nBuilding better devices and services\n\n46\n\fNew plastic made from fossil fuels is the industry standard for consumer electronics, and incorporating recycled plastic involves surmounting a number of challenges. It requires building new processes and approaches while ensuring that materials meet our rigorous quality and technical specifications, costs are viable, and products are delivered on time. To meet these requirements, we spent years building partnerships with top-tier raw materials suppliers willing to invest in producing high-quality materials and innovation. Going forward, we're committed to expanding the use of sustainable materials across our portfolio of products.\nWe're also making it easier for people to give their old devices a second life. Customers can responsibly recycle devices for free--whether made by Google or not--via our take-back program for all products, available in 16 countries, and via our U.S. Pixel trade-in program, through which customers can earn credit toward a new Pixel purchase.\nOur commitments go beyond the consumer electronic products we make. We're committed to minimizing our environmental impact as well as improving the lives of people who make our products. We require the highest ethical standards throughout our supply chain and are working to drive positive impacts in the communities in which we operate. Our Supplier Code of Conduct articulates our expectations for suppliers and is based on the Google Code of Conduct and on international human rights, safety, and environmental standards.\nBuilding on the progress we've already made, in 2019, we shared our inaugural public commitments for consumer hardware. First, we aim to design products and services for circularity and to reuse materials at their highest\n\nThe Nest Learning Thermostat in a home\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nBuilding better devices and services\n\n47\n\fGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nA family using the Google Pixel Slate\nenvironmental and social value. Many of our Nest products already include significant levels of post-consumer recycled plastic. Starting in 2022, 100% of Made by Google products will include recycled materials, and we'll strive to maximize recycled content wherever possible. By decreasing our use of new materials, we'll reduce our waste per device while signaling our demand for a more circular economy.\nSecond, we aim to be the neighbor everyone wants in the communities in which we operate. By 2020, 100% of all shipping of device orders going to or from customers will be carbon neutral. To achieve carbon neutrality for shipping, we have a two-step approach: The first step is carbon reduction. Our goal is to work with shipping partners to reduce shipping emissions; we've already successfully driven a shift from air to ocean in many cases, and we'll continue to look for solutions like this. For the emissions that remain, our second step will be to purchase high-quality carbon offsets. Shipping devices to consumers falls outside the scope of Google's operations, and thus goes above and beyond our long-standing commitment to carbon neutrality.\nFinally, we're committed to make technology that puts people first and to expand access to the benefits of technology. One way we do this is through energy partnerships.\n\nBuilding better devices and services\n\n48\n\fGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nEnergy partnerships\nOur products enable customers to be more thoughtful about their individual environmental impact. Connected homes can help streamline consumers' daily decisions about resource consumption, making sustainable choices easier for busy households. For example, smart thermostats can play a critical role in addressing climate change by automatically saving energy and helping consumers be more aware of their energy usage. These savings benefit customers, as well as the utilities generating and delivering the energy, while reducing energy use and GHG emissions.\nThe Nest thermostat controls residential heating and cooling systems-- which make up around half of a home's energy consumption--and uses AI and ML to reduce energy consumption and achieve collective savings as it learns how and when to keep users comfortable while at the same time optimizing for energy efficiency. On average, Nest thermostats have proven energy savings of 10%12% for heating and 15% for cooling,47 which means they pay for themselves in under two years as a result of those savings.48 In February 2017, the Nest Learning Thermostat became the first thermostat to achieve ENERGY STAR certification by the EPA.49 And by the end of 2018, Nest thermostats had helped customers cumulatively save more than 29 billion kWh of energy (see Figure 13), based on average savings studies-- enough energy to power all of San Francisco's electricity consumption for five years and nearly three times as much energy as Google used in 2018. That's\n\nFigure 13\nCUMULATIVE HOUSEHOLD ENERGY SAVED BY NEST THERMOSTAT USERS\nn Savings per year\n\n29.1 -- 30\n\n-- 25\n\n-- 20\n\n-- 15\n\n-- 10\n\n-- 5\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nTHOUSAND GWh\n\nBuilding better devices and services\n\n49\n\fGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nequivalent to avoiding 9.6 million tCO2e emissions--or taking more than 2 million cars off the road for a year.50\nWe help consumers save energy and money by forming partnerships with a variety of energy companies and service providers across North America. We've partnered with nearly 100 companies to offer Nest thermostat and demand response programs.\nNest's Rush Hour Rewards program works in partnership with utilities to reduce energy use during times of peak demand through harnessing the power of consumer engagement--acting as a leader in demand response programs for energy customers. For example, during the 2017 solar eclipse, Nest launched a special Rush Hour program with an opt-in feature that allowed Nest thermostats to automatically pre-cool customers' homes, reducing demand on the grid at a time when solar energy production dropped by thousands of megawatts. More than 750,000 Nest thermostats worked together across the United States to reduce demand by 700 MW.51 In 2018, Nest and partners also pioneered residential gas demand response programs. In a world of gas shortages and increasing weather variability, these programs are proving their capability to manage demand spikes and increase system flexibility.\nWe also work with energy, government, nonprofit, and manufacturer partners to expand access to the benefits of technology through incomequalified programs. Today, nearly one in four U.S. families struggle with a high energy burden, with up to 20%50% of income going to energy bills.52 In 2018, we launched the Nest Power Project, which aims to install 1 million energy- and money-saving Nest thermostats in homes that need them most over the next five years. We're proud to help our partners meet their efficiency and customer participation goals and are excited about our collective impact on consumers as well as the environment.\nLEARN MORE 2015 white paper: Energy Savings from the Nest Learning Thermostat 2018 report: Circular Consumer Electronics: An Initial Exploration 2018 reports: Product Environmental reports 2018 report: Responsible Supply Chain Report Guidelines: Alphabet's Conflict Minerals Policy and Report Guidelines: Google Supplier Code of Conduct Guidelines: Policy Against Modern Slavery and 2018 Modern Slavery Statement Guidelines: Restricted Substances Specification Website: Google Store Sustainability Website: Nest Power Project Website: Responsible Supply Chain\n\nBuilding better devices and services\n\n50\n\fSpotlight\nNest uses energy-saving technology to relieve the low-income energy burden\nIn the United States, low-income households spend three times as much of their income on energy as higher-income households.53 What's more, many of these families live in older homes with inefficient heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, often forcing families in some parts of the United States to devote up to 50% of their monthly income toward utilities.54\nOn Earth Day 2018, Nest and Google began tackling this energy gap with the Nest Power Project, an initiative designed to bring energy-saving technologies and assistance to those who need them most. To date, the project has donated more than $800,000 to nonprofits, such as United Way and Habitat for Humanity, that are helping connect low-income families with energy-assistance programs.\nThe Power Project has also teamed up with nonprofits, utility companies, and mortgage financiers to install the Nest Thermostat E--a smart thermostat with proven energy-saving features--in qualified low-income households. This includes every home built by Habitat for Humanity in the United States in 2018 and low- and moderate-income households served by organizations such as Southern California Gas and Fannie Mae. Together, we aim to install 1 million energy- and money-saving Nest thermostats in low-income U.S. homes in the next five years.\nWhile Google and Nest ultimately envision a more energy-efficient future to help combat climate change, the Power Project is working to provide energy savings for families today. \"If our thermostats and technology can help even one family stay warm this winter, we'll consider it a job well done,\" says Jeff Hamel, director of energy and enterprise partnerships at Google.

We want to leverage our scale, resources, and technological expertise to meet the vast challenge posed by climate change and work to empower everyone--businesses, governments, nonprofit organizations, communities, and individuals--to use Google technology to help create a more sustainable and resource-efficient world.\nGoogle Earth is used globally by millions to explore and understand our ever-changing planet. While Google Earth is for exploration and raising awareness, Google Earth Engine is focused on planetary-scale geospatial analysis, giving researchers access to Google's massive cloud and computational capabilities. It includes 20 petabytes of freely available geospatial data, which are used by tens of thousands of active users around the world to create new knowledge that's fundamentally changing what we know about Earth's natural resources and how to manage them.\nGoogle Maps provides more than 1 billion kilometers' (621 million miles') worth of transit results per day, helping limit carbon emissions by giving people access to mass transit options, bike routes, and traffic information. In 2018, Google Maps added new features that enable users to search for information about electric vehicle charging stations around the world and to see nearby Lime scooters, pedal bikes, and e-bikes as alternative transportation options right from the app.\nWaze Carpool is also tackling the issue of too many cars on the road by encouraging Waze users to commute together, saving time and money, while reducing the strain on transportation infrastructure and the environment. By the end of 2018, Waze Carpool was available nationally throughout Israel, Brazil, and the United States.\nUsing technology for good\nIn 2018, Google AI announced its AI for Social Good program, which applies core Google research and engineering efforts to projects that help address social, humanitarian, and environmental challenges. Additionally, the program provides tools and resources through initiatives like the Google AI Impact Challenge, which was an open call for nonprofits, academics, and social enterprises from around the world to submit proposals on how they could use AI to help address some of the world's greatest problems.\nIn 2018, as part of Google's AI for Social Good program and Crisis Response efforts, Google announced a flood-forecasting initiative pilot in Patna, India. To help keep people safe during floods, Google is using AI to create better forecasting models that predict when and where floods will occur. The predictions are made using a combination of ML, satellite imagery, and\n\nEmpowering users with technology\n\n53\n\fAttendees explore the interactive Your Plan, Your Planet tool at Google's booth at the 2018 Greentech Festival in Berlin, Germany.\nphysics-based simulations. The predictions are then shared with affected individuals via Google Search, Google Maps, and Google Public Alerts.\nAI can also aid in wildlife conservation. In 2018, as part of Google's AI for Social Good program, we announced the work of Google AI researchers who teamed up with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to identify if humpback whales are present in more than 170,000 hours' worth of underwater audio recordings. This is part of a larger effort to help scientists better understand and protect whales--and hopefully in the future, other animal species as well.\nUsing TensorFlow, Google's open source ML platform, we're enabling thousands of companies, nonprofits, researchers, developers, and students to apply ML to better predict extreme weather events, help farmers glean insights into their herd's health and efficiency improvements for their farms, and prevent illegal deforestation in the Amazon.\nIn 2018, Google teamed up with the California Academy of Sciences to launch Your Plan, Your Planet, an interactive tool to help people understand their environmental impact as it relates to food, energy, and water, while demonstrating simple, science-based ways to improve it.\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nEmpowering users with technology\n\n54\n\fRooftop solar provides renewable energy to a community in Manchester, England. Project Sunroof expanded coverage to the United Kingdom in 2018.\nTools for everyone\nWe also put Google technology to work helping others study and respond to environmental challenges. Our Geo team works with numerous research and nonprofit organizations to map the world's forests, fisheries, watersheds, and air quality--and even to create a global database of power plants. We then work on getting that information into the hands of decision-makers.\nIn 2018, we launched the Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE), an online tool created in collaboration with the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy and in partnership with five pilot cities: Buenos Aires, Argentina; Melbourne, Australia; Victoria, Canada; Mountain View, California, USA; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. By analyzing Google's comprehensive global mapping data together with standard GHG emission factors, EIE estimates city-scale building and transportation carbon emissions data, as well as renewable energy potential, leading to more globally consistent baselines from which cities can measure, plan, act upon, and track progress toward emissions reductions.\nProject Sunroof is an online tool that helps users explore whether they should go solar by analyzing high-resolution aerial mapping and 3D modeling of residential roofs to sun positions, historical weather patterns, shadows cast by nearby objects, and typical electricity consumption. In 2018, Project Sunroof expanded coverage into new markets around the world, including Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, and\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nEmpowering users with technology\n\n55\n\fGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nthe United Kingdom. Collectively, Project Sunroof has mapped more than 107 million rooftops across 21,500 cities since 2015. Policymakers are also using Sunroof data to make bold renewable energy commitments. For example, the City of San Jos, California used the data for a city-wide solar assessment to set a 1 GW solar energy target as part of its Smart City Action Plan. In addition to city climate plans, Sunroof data is being used by some of the world's largest utilities, such as Engie and E.ON, to provide customers with the option to power their homes with solar energy.\nProject Air View measures air quality data using Google Street View cars equipped with air quality sensors. In 2018, Project Air View increased its air quality mapping efforts, expanding beyond the United States to map air quality in Copenhagen, Denmark, and London, United Kingdom. We announced plans to further expand coverage to more cities around the world by equipping 50 Street View vehicles with Aclima's mobile air sensors. By the end of 2018, Project Air View had captured more than 475 million cumulative air quality measurements in 62 cities worldwide.\nThrough Google Earth Timelapse, a global, zoomable video that lets us see how the world has changed over recent decades, we can watch as cities grow, forests disappear, glaciers recede, and lakes dry up. We can also help monitor and promote sustainable resource management with tools like Global Fishing Watch (GFW), which monitors the planet's fisheries by tracking the locations and behaviors of commercial fishing fleets, powered by Google Cloud Platforms' machine learning algorithms. In 2018, GFW published 13 papers in top-tier journals and successfully drove new commitments and programs with governments from Canada, Indonesia, Japan, and Peru. Ultimately, our vision is to continue leveraging our mapping, cloud, and ML technologies to create a living, breathing dashboard of our planet that can help inform everyday decisions for individuals, organizations, and nations.\nLEARN MORE 2017 report: Cities in the Circular Economy: The Role of Digital Technology 2018 spotlight: Transparency unleashed: How Global Fishing Watch is transforming fishery management 2018 blog: A tale of a whale song 2018 blog: AI for Social Good 2018 blog: Get charged up with Google Maps 2018 blog: How we explored the whole wide world with Google Earth in the past year 2018 blog: Fighting fire with machine learning: two students use TensorFlow to predict wildfires 2018 blog: The fight against illegal deforestation with TensorFlow 2018 blog: Air View is ready to expand to more places around the globe 2018 blog: Your Plan, Your Planet: How to reduce your environmental footprint\n\nEmpowering users with technology\n\n56\n\fSpotlight\nThe more you know: Turning environmental insights into action\nTo date, more than 10,000 cities worldwide have committed to reducing their carbon footprints by 80% within the next 30 years. But, unlike large cities like New York and Berlin, which have access to huge carbon data sets, many small and midsize cities lack the resources to gather comprehensive data on building and transportation emissions. This makes it hard to set firm carbon commitments of their own.\nThe Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE), an online tool created by Google in collaboration with the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy, is designed to provide carbon emissions insights to cities of all sizes-- and ultimately accelerate the transition to a low-carbon future.\nDeveloped by the Google Earth Outreach team, EIE analyzes data from Google Maps and Google's other climate-related projects, like Project Sunroof, to surface insights across four categories: building emissions, transportation emissions, solar energy potential, and climate projections. EIE pairs this information with third-party data and standard GHG emissions factors, deriving carbon estimates and reduction potential for cities around the world.\nAlthough EIE is starting with a handful of cities initially, Google eventually plans to make these insights available to thousands of towns, cities, and regions across the globe. \"Imagine what we could accomplish if every city in the world were engaged in the fight against climate change,\" says Rebecca Moore, leader of the Earth Outreach team. \"What would the world look like?\" Read how Environmental Insights Explorer is bringing insights to cities\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nThe Environmental Insights Explorer tool provides city-level carbon emissions data.\n\nEmpowering users with technology\n\n57\n\fAppendix\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\n58\n\fEnvironmental data\nThe following table provides an overview of our performance over time and includes environmental data for our global operations, including our data centers, offices, and other facilities.\nData for GHG emissions and energy use covers Alphabet Inc. and all of its subsidiaries, including Google LLC.

At the end of 2018, we had 15 operational campuses across 19 data center locations. Some of our locations have more than one data center campus and others were not yet operational during 2018.\n14. According to Google's own analysis of our more efficient servers, power infrastructure, and cooling systems, compared with data center industry averages. 15. See note 14 above. 16. PUE is a standard industry ratio that compares the amount of noncomputing overhead energy (used for things like cooling and power distribution) to the amount of energy used to power\nIT equipment. A PUE of 2.0 means that for every watt of IT power, an additional watt is consumed to cool and distribute power to the IT equipment. A PUE closer to 1.0 means nearly all the energy is used for computing. 17. According to the Uptime Institute's 2019 Data Center Industry Survey, the global average PUE of respondents' largest data centers was around 1.67. 18. This slight decline from 2017 is partly due to new sites not yet included in our energy management system and partly due to a change in how we calculate this number. 19. At Google, Zero Waste to Landfill means that when waste leaves our operating data centers, none of it goes to a landfill--100% is diverted to more sustainable pathways, with no more than 10% going to a waste-to-energy facility, unless waste to energy can be proved more valuable than alternative diversion paths. Our approach is based on UL's Environmental Claim Validation Procedure for Zero Waste to Landfill. Some waste cannot be diverted away from landfill for regulatory reasons. 20.

See note 36 above. 39. Carbon intensity figures are based on our combined Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions, with the exception of electricity consumption intensity, which is calculated using\nonly market-based Scope 2 at the data centers. 40. A carbon offset is an investment in an activity that reduces carbon emissions. The reduction in carbon emissions is represented by a carbon credit. The credit, usually verified by a\nthird party, signifies that GHG emissions are lower than they would have been had no one invested in the offset. One credit equals 1 metric ton (1,000 kilograms or 2,204 pounds) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) prevented from being released into the atmosphere. 41. CO2e is a quantity that describes, for a given mixture and amount of GHG, the amount of CO2 that would have the same global warming potential (GWP), i.e., the ability of a gas to trap heat in the atmosphere when measured over a specified timescale (generally, 100 years). Some GHGs are more potent than others, as measured by their GWP. Carbon dioxide is the baseline and thus has a GWP of 1.\nCreating sustainable workplaces\n42. Neil E.

Alphabet's fiscal year runs from January 1 to December 31. Unless otherwise specified, reported data is global. 56. GHG emissions are calculated according to WRI's Greenhouse Gas Protocol. For more information on our methodology, see Alphabet's 2019 CDP Climate Change Report. 57. Since 2010, we've procured renewable energy for our operations, and in 2012, we began publishing how this reduces our overall carbon footprint. Up until 2015, there was no guidance\nfrom WRI on how to account for these emissions reductions, so we developed our own methodology, whereby on an annual basis we assigned renewable electricity procured against electricity consumed (in MWh) in the closest data center to the renewable energy project. In 2015, WRI released new guidance for market-based Scope 2 accounting, which we adopted, starting with 2015 data. Our pre-2015 methodology differs from WRI's in the use of residual mixes, which avoid double-counting of claimed renewable energy attributes. 58. In 2018, to align with industry best practices for Scope 3 reporting, we extended our reporting boundaries to include emissions associated with food from our corporate offices, hardware manufacturing emissions beyond Tier 1 suppliers (full upstream to the point of extraction), use of sold products, and end-of-life treatment of sold products. Google's hardware includes data center servers, networking equipment and consumer hardware products. These extended categories will be reported annually going forward. 59. In 2016, we adopted the industry practice of including only operational emissions in our carbon neutrality commitment. Our 2016 operational emissions include Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting). For more information, see our 2017 white paper 10 Years of Carbon Neutrality. 60. See note 58 above. 61. See note 59 above. 62. See note 39 above. 63. Total energy consumption represents total Scope 2 electricity consumption plus total Scope 1 fuel use. 64. Power usage effectiveness (PUE) is an industry-recognized ratio to measure data center efficiency. For more information on our PUE and how we calculate it, see \"Efficiency: How We Do It\" on our website. 65. Percentage of renewable energy is calculated on a calendar-year basis, comparing the volume of renewable electricity (in MWh) purchased for our operations (i.e., renewable energy procured through our PPA contracts, on-site renewable energy generation, and residual renewable electricity delivered directly through the grid) with the total volume of electricity consumed by our operations.\n\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019\n\nAppendix\n\n63\n\f66. To align with the method outlined in note 65 above, starting in 2016, we adapted our methodology for calculating total electricity obtained from renewable sources. Prior to 2016, we were not accounting for the residual renewable electricity purchased through grid electricity.\n67. Waste diverted to a more sustainable pathway than landfill or incineration without energy recovery. 68. Decommissioning activity decreased in 2017 and 2018 because most of the decommissioning returns in this period were from an older generation of technology, which did not qualify\nfor redeployment. 69. Includes all water (both recycled and potable) consumed at offices and data centers. 70. Number of ports for ChargePoint stations in the United States only, which represent the majority of our electric vehicle charging ports in the United States. Emissions avoided are\nestimated using data from these ports only. 71. In addition to our renewable energy contracts, Google also invests in renewable energy projects around the world that have an attractive risk-adjusted financial return. These projects\nare not used to offset our carbon footprint. 72.
