A message from our Chief Executive Officer

Why are we doing this?
Why are we launching big efforts like Project GigatonTM? Why did we set ambitious goals such as creating zero waste and using 100% renewable energy? Why, as a retailer, have a position on human rights? Why issue an Environmental, Social & Governance Report every year to track progress?
Well, as with many things at Walmart, the WHY of it starts with our founder, Sam Walton.
Twenty-seven years ago, President George H.W. Bush traveled to Bentonville to present Sam with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It was a pinnacle moment for Walmart, and our founder shared a few powerful and timeless thoughts. He provided a forward-looking purpose for our company that drives us today:
"If we can, why, we'll lower the cost of living for everyone -- not just in America, but we'll give the world an opportunity to see what it's like to save and have a better lifestyle and a better life for all."
Sam said "and." Our purpose is to help give people all over the world the opportunity to save "... AND have a better lifestyle AND a better life for all." Some have described Sam as a merchant with a servant's heart. During his life, he gave back to the communities where we had stores and, as the scale of the company has grown, our desire to strengthen communities and make a difference in the world continues on.

Sam made those comments in 1992. In 2005, our President and CEO Lee Scott painted a vision of "21st Century Leadership" and challenged us to expand our thinking and impact. He said, "For us there is no distinction between being a responsible citizen and a successful business. They are one and the same for Walmart."
What Sam and Lee said applies now more than ever. We believe it's important to run our business in a way that generates lasting value for our customers, our associates, our shareholders and for society more broadly.
To many of us today, trust seems in short supply. Institutions, including business, especially big business, are being questioned. We see it in the headlines. We think that people want to trust again but, of course, trust has to be earned. People want to see companies doing good in the world, and people want to work for companies they believe in. Business should serve more than just one stakeholder group. It's not enough to just serve shareholders or just serve customers; rather, the opportunity for businesses and their leadership is to add value for all stakeholders. We've felt that way for a long time and we've been taking action, but we're challenging ourselves to make even better choices and do more.
We're investing in our associates through wages along with better educational opportunities, benefits and training. For example, since the first U.S. Walmart Academy opened in 2016, more than

800,000 associates have gone through training. And we expanded our parental-leave and adoption policies and raised starting wages again. As of last year, a fulltime hourly associate in the U.S. who gives birth to a child is eligible for up to 16 weeks of paid time away.
We're launching new efforts to be more sustainable. Earlier this year, we announced a plan to reduce plastic waste in the packaging for our private brands. By 2025, we aim to use 100% recyclable, reusable, or industrially compostable packaging for our private brands in the U.S.
We're continuing our fight against hunger. Four years ago, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation committed to providing 4 billion meals through funding and food donations by 2020. We are ahead of schedule.

And we're working to source responsibly and improve supply chain conditions. For example, we're proud to be a founding member in 2013 of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which concluded its commitment last year. Over the past five years, 90% of high-priority remediation items were complete across all factories affiliated with the Alliance and almost 1.6 million workers have been trained in fire safety. We continue to collaborate with stakeholders to improve the lives of workers in the global supply chain.
In the end, we all must answer one simple question: What valuable purpose did we serve? Either as an individual or as a company, which is simply a collection of individuals, what good did we do for the world?

Walmart is nearing the end of its sixth decade. We've been around a while, and with longevity comes a perspective and vision beyond next week. We're in it for the long haul. And we understand that for a business to last, it must have a fundamental reason for being, which is found in the value it creates for all-- customers, associates, communities, shareholders, suppliers, future generations ... and the planet. Remember, Sam said "and." This is the And.

A message from our Chief Sustainability Officer

Business exists to serve society.
For Walmart, this is true in many ways: providing customers with convenient access to affordable food and other products; employing associates; helping suppliers grow their businesses that in turn employ others; generating tax dollars that help support community life; providing a return to shareholders.
The most successful businesses do such things but go one step further -- they aim in the long term to improve the systems on which they rely, such as retail workforce development or food supply chains. Why? Not only to build customer trust, but also to enhance supply security, improve the quality of products and services, manage costs and expenses more effectively, generate new revenue streams, and attract and retain talent. Strengthening these systems is not only the responsible thing to do -- it maximizes business value.
By many measures, there has never been a better time to be alive than today. Yet society faces many challenges. While global prosperity has increased, so has inequality; and studies point to a skills gap that needs to be addressed to help people advance economically, especially as evolving technologies change the nature of work. Meanwhile, increasing global demand is placing unsustainable pressure on

the climate and natural ecosystems, challenging us all to shift from a "take-make-dispose" system of production and consumption to a circular, regenerative approach.
That's why our approach to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues goes beyond minimizing our own footprint or mitigating risk. We take a more transformative approach: working to spark collective action in an effort to alter the sector in the long term for environmental, social and economic sustainability.
So in the case of economic opportunity for retail associates, for example, we aim not only to help people enter the workforce with competitive wages, but also to help them build skills needed to advance, whether at Walmart or beyond. We want to build a skills-based employment system, with ladders of opportunity, at scale, that is inclusive and reflective of our communities.
And when it comes to human rights in supply chains, we aim not only to source responsibly, but also to work with others to rewire chains for social sustainability -- for example, improving Bangladesh factory safety through our work with the Alliance, or fighting modern slavery in seafood through our work with the Seafood Task Force and the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment.

With respect to climate change, we want to address our own operations while galvanizing collective action across the retail supply chain to bend the curve on emissions -- working with suppliers in an attempt to avoid a gigaton of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 through initiatives in energy, waste, agriculture, packaging, natural capital and product design.
In this report, you will find a summary of our aspirational goals and recent progress related to our priority ESG issues. For example, since our last report, we conducted our first climate risk assessment and

have advanced toward our science-based targets for emissions reduction; we have launched new initiatives in waste reduction, particularly related to plastic. Inspired by the United Nations (U.N.) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we published our first human rights statement to make it easier to see how we respect human rights across our business. We continue to strengthen our retail associate proposition and make strides working with others toward the social and environmental sustainability of multiple supply chains.

As always, we welcome your feedback and your collective action in helping to transform retail systems for long-term environmental, social and economic sustainability.

Shared value: our approach to ESG

Our approach to environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics is rooted in our company's purpose to save people money so they can live better.
Key elements of our approach
Creating shared value
Embedded in our purpose is the principle of shared value: We increase business value by helping to address important needs in society and, conversely, we can help transform society through our business. For example, better ESG practices can enhance customer trust, catalyze new product lines, increase productivity, reduce costs and secure future supply, while simultaneously improving livelihoods, advancing economic mobility and opportunity, reducing emissions and waste, and restoring natural capital.
Salient issues
We set ESG priorities based on relevance to our company purpose, key categories and markets; Walmart's ability to create change; and relative importance to our customers and other stakeholders.

Whole-systems change
To maximize shared value, we aim not only to run a good retail business, but also to make largescale and lasting improvements to the ecosystems most salient to our business. Walmart has a unique ability to make a difference through our strengths, including our approximately 2.2 million associates around the world, supplier relationships, jobs, purchase orders and expertise.
Business leadership
We drive and track performance against our social and environmental priorities through our everyday business activities. For example, we track performance toward our diversity goals through our human resources activities, and toward our aspirational renewable energy goals through real estate and operations activities. ESG initiatives are embedded throughout our company in our business planning and performance management cycle, operating policies, organization roles and coordinating mechanisms, project governance, and systems and tools (e.g., the Sustainability Index).

Aligned philanthropy
Our corporate giving and the Walmart Foundation's programs complement our business initiatives by seeking to help accelerate social and environmental transformation. In FY2019, through a combination of in-kind and cash gifts, Walmart gave more than $1.4 billion to projects that create opportunity, enhance sustainability and strengthen communities.
Collective action
Since we believe that collective action is essential to transforming systems, we shape our ESG programs in collaboration with other leaders and stakeholders. Project Gigaton, the Retail Opportunity Network and the Sustainability Index are just a few examples of large-scale, system-wide collaborations we have helped create.

Defining our ESG priorities, goals & targets

Our ESG priorities are grounded in our long-term business strategy and account for macro-economic, social and environmental trends. These priorities are where we see the most opportunity for shared value.
Stakeholders provide valuable insight into our priorities. In 2014, we formally engaged stakeholders through our materiality review process. The results informed our 2025 commitments, where we committed to progress in topics such as associate opportunity, social challenges in supply chains, environmental sustainability, human rights and community resiliency.
Materiality, as used in the context of this report and our materiality review process, is different than the definition used in the context of filings with the SEC. Issues deemed material for purposes of this report, and for purposes of determining our ESG strategies, may not be considered material for SEC reporting purposes.
We conduct regular updates through ongoing stakeholder engagement and dialogue. We address numerous ESG issues through our business, in partnership with others and through philanthropy, and we provide information on those throughout this report. Three issues that rise to the top of our priority list include: (1) economic opportunity for Walmart associates; (2) the safety and livelihoods of workers in supply chains; and (3) climate change.

Economic opportunity
Workforce development is one of the biggest issues facing economies around the world, especially as technology accelerates the pace of change for the jobs of today and tomorrow.
Because the retail industry provides a point of entry into the job market for millions of workers, it has the potential to act as a springboard for economic mobility if workers can gain the experience and skills required to advance.
Our workforce development approach focuses on access, stability and mobility. For example, Walmart U.S. provides an entry point into work for thousands of associates; competitive wages and strong benefits (from healthcare to retirement savings); and access to affordable education opportunities relevant for advancement in retail jobs. With the emergence of automation and artificial intelligence, our training and development programs become even more relevant for workforce success, as they help equip associates with critical 21st century skills.
As described in more detail later in this report, our efforts are underpinned by a commitment to fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion throughout our company. By investing in a more diverse and dynamic workforce, we hope to keep pace with evolving customer demands, while also acting as a force for economic inclusion.

Social issues in the supply chain
With retail operations in 27 countries, Walmart's supply chain includes more than 100,000 suppliers across the globe. Walmart respects human rights in the supply chain. Our Responsible Sourcing team, working with and through our suppliers, mitigates risks related to worker safety and well-being. We set expectations for our suppliers through our Standards for Suppliers and use audits to help assess whether our standards are being upheld. We also evaluate our global supply chain using internal and external data, risk assessments of particular regions, countries, commodities or products, and guidance from industry experts and non-governmental organizations.
Recognizing the need for whole-system transformation in a number of retail supply chains industry-wide, Walmart has committed to use our ability to bring together stakeholders including industries, civil society, governments and international organizations, to address the major potential risks to the dignity of workers in a minimum of 10 retail supply chains by 2025. Based on our analyses and where we believe Walmart can have the greatest impact, we've identified the following five supply chains:
 Produce in the U.S. and Mexico
 Shrimp in Thailand
 Tuna processed in Thailand
 Apparel in Bangladesh
 Electronics sourced for the U.S. retail market supply chain
Learn more about our action in the Responsible supply chains section.

Climate change
We believe climate change is likely to affect national economies and supply chains around the world through potential effects such as lower crop yields, increased health costs and storm damage. According to The Sustainability Consortium, 60% of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide come from the global production and use of consumer goods. With operations and a value chain that span the globe, we aim to galvanize collective action to reduce emissions, while taking steps to strengthen the resilience of our business.
Accordingly, we have set a science-based target1 that covers our GHG emissions footprint: We aim to reduce emissions in our operations (Scopes 1 and 2) by 18% by 2025 from 2015 levels; and we are working with suppliers to reduce or avoid emissions in our supply chain by 1 gigaton by 2030 through an initiative known as Project Gigaton.

Challenges to achieving aspirational goals, commitments & targets

The aspirational goals, commitments and targets we set under priority topics are designed to help Walmart aim high, hold ourselves accountable and move at an aggressive pace. Our public ESG commitments galvanize action across our business through seniorlevel oversight, policies and programs. We hold ourselves accountable through metrics, measurement and annual reporting, including the annual publication

of our ESG Report. In 2016, our CEO Doug McMillon announced our 2025 commitments and targets. These are laid out in greater detail at the beginning of the Environmental and Social sections of this report.
ESG issues are complex. We believe that setting goals and driving action toward meeting them is necessary to advance progress on many environmental and

social issues facing society. Because success depends on the collective efforts of many, as well as factors such as technical advances, policy changes, economic and price volatility, and supplier engagement, there may be times where we fall short. While we strive in each case to meet our goals and targets, sometimes challenges may delay or block progress.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are the leading contributor to rising global temperatures and other signs of climate change. To avoid the worst effects of climate change, the Paris Agreement calls for collective action across society to limit global temperature increases to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius.
At Walmart, we are focused on reducing emissions in our operations, engaging suppliers to reduce emissions in supply chains, strengthening the resilience of our business and using our voice to advocate for collective action.
Climate change impact scenario analysis
To better understand the nature of climate change and potential implications for the retail sector, we conducted a climate scenario analysis, working with an independent third-party consultant; we aimed to align with the scenario guidance set forth by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).
The analysis considered two scenarios for global warming: 2 C (the upper end of the range targeted by the Paris Agreement) and 4 C (often called "business as usual"). Each scenario looked out to the years 2030 and 2050, making assumptions about four climate variables: temperature, drought/water stress, extreme weather events and sea level. The analysis modeled potential effects of these variables on aspects of retail business operations such as store heating and cooling requirements; crop yields (e.g., bananas, corn, lettuce, tomatoes, wheat, cotton); and storm

damage to stores and distribution centers. The analysis made many simplifying assumptions. For example, each variable was considered in isolation. The analysis did not consider second- or third-order effects. It also did not consider potentially offsetting impacts of new technologies, mitigating actions or new business opportunities. While the limitations of the analysis mean that it can't be used to predict net long-term impact on financials or business operations, it nevertheless helped to validate our current business strategies and initiatives for energy demand, commodity sourcing, value chain innovation, water management and resiliency. We discussed the analysis with teams across our business and the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Walmart Board. For more information on this analysis, please see our 2018 CDP climate change disclosure.
Climate change mitigation
We believe mitigating the effects of climate change will require collective action to reduce GHG emissions. Because most emissions in the retail sector lie in product supply chains rather than in stores and distribution centers, we have committed to pursue substantial emissions reduction not only in our own operations but also across product supply chains, by catalyzing and supporting initiatives among suppliers, NGOs, customers and others at scale.

Sustainable operations
We have set a science-based target12 to reduce GHG emissions in our own operations (Scopes 1 and 2) by 18% by 2025 (compared with 2015 levels) through multiple initiatives. These include increasing the energy efficiency of our buildings, aiming to power 50% of our operations with renewable energy by 2025, improving the performance of our refrigeration systems and maximizing the sustainability of our fleet.

We are on track to meet our goals. As of 2017, we had reduced emissions by 6.1% compared with 2015 levels.13 Also, renewable sources supplied an estimated 28% of our electricity needs globally;14 this includes generation from more than 520 projects across eight countries, 18 U.S. states and Puerto Rico. Based on our pipeline of solar and wind projects, we expect to source 35% of our electricity from renewables by 2020.

Project GigatonTM
Beyond our direct operations, we aim to galvanize transformative action through Project Gigaton, a global effort that invites suppliers to join us in a commitment to avoid 1 billion metric tons of emissions in our collective value chains by 2030.
Launched in 2017, Project Gigaton engages suppliers in setting targets and pursuing initiatives to avoid emissions in any of six areas where there are opportunities to do so: energy use, sustainable agriculture, waste, deforestation, packaging and product use.
We worked with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) on the overall concept and design, as well as the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), Conservation International (CI), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the Sustainable Packaging Coalition (SPC) and CDP to connect suppliers to measurement methodologies, guidance and practical tools to help them reduce emissions. The program builds upon lessons learned from initiatives Walmart has undertaken with suppliers and NGOs in the past, such as our 20 million metric ton initiative.
"Project Gigaton is the biggest and best example of a company encouraging its suppliers to be part of the solution to climate change. Through Walmart's scale, collaboration and innovation, it continues to lead the way on actions that create both business and environmental value."
--FRED KRUPP | PRESIDENT, EDF

Walmart established an external review process to support continual improvement of the methodologies to account for avoided emissions from Project Gigaton. A steering committee with subcommittees of technical experts from CDP, EDF, SPC, WWF and others lead the review process. To learn more about the platform, tools, resources and measurement methodology visit Project Gigaton on the Walmart Sustainability Hub.
We are currently on track to achieve our gigaton goal. To date, more than 1,000 suppliers have formally signed on to the project. In 2018 alone, 382 suppliers reported avoiding 58,904,20617 MT of emissions, totaling 93,656,63918 MT toward the 1 gigaton target in the first two years of the program. We encourage suppliers to set specific, measurable, actionable, relevant and time-bound ("SMART") goals, because we believe they lead to substantially better results over time; to date, 47% of Project Gigaton suppliers have set such goals.
In the coming year, we plan to focus on attracting additional suppliers and broadening the scope of initiatives across programmatic areas. While the program is on track, nearly 80% of reported avoided emissions were related to energy (under the Energy or Product Use action areas). Fewer have made commitments related to Deforestation or Sustainable Agriculture, where success requires influencing a disparate set of actors far upstream in the supply chain, addressing interdependencies and barriers in complex social and economic systems, and gaining alignment with others regarding methodologies for measurement and action. We are working with suppliers and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to support the development of tools to enable some improvement in these areas.

Project Gigaton action areas
Suppliers can make commitments and pursue initiatives in one or more of six areas:

1. Energy

We encourage suppliers to avoid energy-related emissions in two ways: first, reduce energy demand through optimization and efficiency; and second, to transition to energy sources that are renewable and emit little to no carbon. At the close of FY2019, our suppliers reported avoiding 25.2 million MT of emissions through work on energy.

The Walmart Factory

25.2 MILLION
MT emissions avoided by Walmart suppliers through work on energy

Energy Efficiency Program (FEEP) is an example of how practical tools can facilitate emissions reductions in supply chains. Through FEEP,

we promote the

use of McKinsey & Company's Resource Efficiency

Deployment Engine (RedE), a web-based tool

designed to help suppliers identify, prioritize and

implement energy efficiency projects. At the close

of FY2019, more than 940 factories had joined the

RedE system; active users report saving more than

$29 million in annual operating expenses and avoiding

199,854 MT of annual CO2e emissions.

2. Waste

Food, product and material waste in factories, warehouses, distribution centers and farms contributes to GHG emissions. Reducing and diverting waste from landfills can increase operating efficiency and lower costs. We encourage suppliers to reduce or eliminate waste from their operations, address postharvest losses on farms, standardize date labeling,

extend product shelf life and educate customers about preventing food waste. Through philanthropy, we have also made investments to assess and reduce waste in food production and distribution. For example, the Walmart Foundation provided funding to the World Resources Institute to implement and accelerate adoption of its Food Loss and Waste Protocol, a publicly available approach to measure food waste and loss. See the Waste section of this report for more information on our efforts to reduce waste in our operations and product value chains.
3. Packaging
Project Gigaton invites suppliers to avoid emissions -- as well as drive down waste -- by reducing unnecessary packaging, optimizing packaging materials and increasing the reuse and recycling of packaging.
Walmart is taking specific aim at plastics, with expanded waste reduction commitments for our U.S. private brands -- commitments that are expected to impact an estimated 30,000 items for sale. Read more about our work to address plastic packaging in our value chain in the Waste section of this report.
One example of progress: In FY2019, more than 800 Walmart private label suppliers signed up for the How2Recycle label (compared with only 100 in FY2018), and more than 16,000 Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) received the How2Recycle label.
4. Agriculture
By pursuing and encouraging suppliers to adopt best practices in areas such as manure management, enteric emissions, feed inputs and other activities in animal agriculture, along with fertilizer optimization in crop production, we estimate there is a potential to impact 20% to 30% of our Project Gigaton GHG

emissions goal by 2030 while reducing waste and improving yield.
We have been working with many of our suppliers to support efforts to reduce emissions through fertilizer optimization. Collectively, suppliers have committed 36 million acres of land in these programs. Additionally, as part of our engagement with the Midwest Row Crop Collaborative, we supported the enrollment of over 140 demonstration farms in the Soil Health Partnership, an organization helping farmers use tools to identify, test and measure management practices for improving soil health.
5. Deforestation
Walmart invites suppliers to join us in working to reduce deforestation through innovative sourcing strategies and the use of technology to increase transparency and supply chain accountability. For example, some suppliers are participating in place-based, multi-stakeholder initiatives that are intended to reduce forest loss and degradation.

Project Gigaton participant Unilever committed to supporting work in Sabah, Malaysia as part of its strategy to achieve a deforestationfree supply chain and avoid emissions. Unilever will help certify 60,000 hectares to the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) standards in Sabah as part of a program led by Forever Sabah, WWF Malaysia and the Palm Oil & NGO (PONGO) Alliance.
We also support certifications to reduce forest loss and improve sustainability of commodities such as palm oil, pulp and paper, as well as Brazilian beef and soy. In 2015, based upon supplier reported data, 100% of our private-brand palm oil was sourced through a combination of RSPO certification criteria, including Mass Balance, Segregated, Identity Preserved and Credits. In 2017, we strengthened our efforts and set a more ambitious goal to source our private-brand palm oil in accordance with the principles and criteria of RSPO, using only Mass Balance or Segregated supply chain systems, or equivalent standards, by the end of 2020.
6. Product use & design
Designers, manufacturers and brands have an opportunity to help customers lower the GHG emissions associated with their use of a product (and often saving customers money at the same time). In Project Gigaton, we ask suppliers to commit, in particular, to improving the in-use energy efficiency of their products.
Walmart has collaborated with suppliers on product innovations that have helped consumers reduce emissions -- such as working with suppliers to popularize LED lightbulbs. More recently, Project Gigaton participant Procter & Gamble announced

a commitment to cut 50 million metric tons of emissions from its operations and value chain by 2030. As part of that commitment, the Tide #QuickColdPledge encourages customers to switch to quick and cold laundry cycles.
For more on how suppliers are demonstrating progress through Project Gigaton, visit our Supplier Recognition page.
Climate change adaptation
With operations and a value chain that span the globe, we are incorporating resiliency planning and initiatives into parts of our business to help address the effects of climate change.
Resilient sourcing
In some cases where the availability or quality of commodities is susceptible to climate variables such as drought, storms and temperature, we are working with our buyers, distribution teams and suppliers on resiliency plans. For example, in our food business, we are working with produce suppliers on strategies such as using greenhouses to grow tomatoes and leafy greens, pioneering techniques to better manage growing conditions, improving yields and reducing the need for fertilizers.

Disaster response & resiliency
Through Walmart's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and Walmart's planning and operational practices, we identify, assess, triage and respond to natural disasters, including epidemiological issues, and security events that affect Walmart operations, associates and the communities we serve.
The EOC operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to identify emerging risks, help facilities and associates prepare for disasters, monitor the development of crises, and serve as a triage point for emergencies in our stores or offices around the world. The EOC activates cross-functional subject matter teams throughout our business to prepare for and respond to disasters quickly and effectively.
The EOC core team includes experts in emergency management who regularly train associates across the enterprise. We use data and predictive analytics to identify and assess weather and environmental risks. This data aids in disaster preparedness and helps maintain or quickly restore operations. In major disasters, we can deploy an array of internal resources, including mobile generators, fuel resources, trucks and associates who can help to manage our corporate response

to the crises on the ground. Through the EOC's efforts to coordinate with local, state and federal governmental agencies, as well as nonprofits and volunteer organizations around the world, Walmart is able to determine how it can help support local communities in the face of disaster.
Philanthropy In the past two years, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation gave nearly $50 million in cash, water, food and other products to support victims of hurricanes, wildfires and tornadoes. Additionally, during the same time period, Walmart raised $44 million in donations from customers to support hurricane relief. We also fund the development of technologies that enhance situational awareness and enable coordination among first responders, such as RC View.

Corporate policies



The Sustainability Index
Our aspirations for sustainable product supply chains go beyond managing risk in our own sourcing; we aim to bring about significant and lasting improvement across product supply chains through collaborative efforts with suppliers, NGOs and others.
Walmart encourages suppliers to report through the Sustainability Index, a science-based, thirdparty tool developed by The Sustainability Consortium in collaboration with universities, NGOs and suppliers. The Index includes data from suppliers on key environmental, social and other

performance indicators at the category level. The Index reflects responses from more than 1,500 unique suppliers covering 115 categories and departments across Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club U.S.
We set a goal in 2012 to buy 70% of our U.S. goods from suppliers that participate in the Index (in categories covered by the Index). We met that goal in 2017, and in 2018, more than 80% of such goods came from participating suppliers. Walmart and Sam's Club U.S. suppliers have improved their Sustainability Index scores by 28% compared with 2016.20

20x25
20x25 means we aspire to source at least 20 key commodities more sustainably by 2025, across the following:
 Fresh produce
 Animal agriculture
 Seafood
 Specialty commodities such as coffee, tea and cocoa
 Row crops
 Consumables, such as personal care products
 Apparel/textiles
We have prioritized the 20x25 commodities based upon a variety of factors, including the nature and magnitude of environmental and social improvement opportunities (as informed by Sustainability Index data and feedback from stakeholders); business opportunity and risk (e.g., sales, supply security, cost issues or reputation risk); and Walmart's ability to convene suppliers and others to promote change. In each case, we are working with suppliers, NGOs and others to understand the current state and pursue initiatives to advance environmental and/or social indicators.
The Index is one of several tools we use to help us make progress on 20x25. As an example, the chart to the right illustrates the category scorecard for consumables suppliers. A Walmart buyer can use this scorecard to identify improvement opportunities for individual suppliers and spotlight issues for categorywide initiatives, such as sustainable chemistry and packaging design.

Our work aims to break the link between the growth of our business and the production of waste. In 2005, Walmart set an aspirational goal to achieve zero waste in our own operations. By 2025, we aim to achieve that goal in Canada, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S.21 In 2018, we diverted 78% of our unsold products, packaging and other materials from landfill and incineration globally.22 We also work with our suppliers to reduce waste through Project Gigaton. Two areas of particular focus are plastic and food waste. In addition to addressing plastic and food waste in our operations, we are working with suppliers upstream and building capacity with consumers and other organizations to eliminate waste downstream.

QUICK FACTS
In the U.S., we diverted 81% of our unsold products, packaging and other waste materials from landfills and incineration
Globally, we diverted more than 1.6 billion pounds of food waste from landfills23

Recycled more than 430 million pounds of plastic film and rigid plastics globally
Donated more than 720 million pounds of food globally, which includes 640 million pounds in the U.S.

Plastic waste
While plastic provides numerous benefits in areas such as food safety and packaging flexibility, society has been unable to collect and recycle plastic at the same rate as it is produced. According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, in 2016, less than 14% of plastic packaging was collected for recycling globally, with the rest ending up in landfills, rivers and oceans.
Plastic waste in our operations
Walmart's aspiration is to achieve zero plastic waste. We are taking actions across our business to use less plastic, recycle more and support innovations to improve plastic waste reduction systems. For example, we aim to use reusable packing containers instead of disposable packaging whenever possible. When we do use disposable packaging, we try to recycle as much of it as possible. In 2018, we recycled 430 million pounds of plastic film and rigid plastics globally.
Plastic waste in our value chain
Approximately 40% of non-fiber plastic produced is used in packaging, the majority of which is used once and discarded. We have asked our suppliers to reduce

unnecessary plastic packaging, increase packaging recyclability and increase recycled content, and to help us educate customers on reducing, reusing and recycling plastic.
As of February 2019, we have committed to work with our U.S. private brand suppliers to:
 Achieve 100% recyclable, reusable or industrially compostable packaging in all Walmart private-brand products by 2025
 Target at least 20% post-consumer recycled content in private-brand packaging by 2025
 Label 100% of food and consumable private-brand packaging with the How2Recycle label by 2022
 Eliminate the nonrecyclable packaging material PVC in general merchandise packaging by 2020
 Reduce private brand plastic packaging when possible
We encourage our national brand suppliers to make similar packaging commitments through Project Gigaton; we engage them on sustainable packaging best practices to support the creation and achievement of such goals.

To encourage customers to recycle, we have asked suppliers to put more consumer-friendly recycling information on packaging. In the U.S., Walmart encourages use of the Sustainable Packaging Coalition's How2Recycle label; in 2019 Walmart Canada announced a commitment to use this label on all private brand products by 2025.
Beyond packaging, we are also working to offer access to low-cost, high-quality alternatives for single-use plastic consumable products and plastic bags.
We participate in the plastic working group at the Consumer Goods Forum and we support The UK Plastic Pact; we are also signatories to the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment.
To learn more about our initiatives to eliminate waste, including our Sustainable Packaging Position Statement and Playbook, see the Walmart Sustainability Hub, Walmart Canada and Walmart Mexico.
Philanthropy
To help reduce plastic waste in the U.S., the Walmart Foundation has made targeted investments to support materials innovation, recycling collection and/or sortation infrastructure and consumer education. For example, the Walmart Foundation has supported the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation's Beyond 34 project, an initiative aimed at increasing the U.S. recycling rate.
Learn more at Walmart.org.

Food waste
We are inspired by the U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 12.3 to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer level and reduce food losses along production and supply chains by 2030. Our end-to-end approach for addressing food waste includes pursuing best practices in our operations, building capacity in the broader food recovery system, working with suppliers upstream and empowering consumers downstream.
Food waste in our operations
We aim for Zero Waste24 in our operations in Canada, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., which encompasses food waste. We are a signatory to the Consumer Goods Forum's Food Waste Resolution and a member of the U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions, both of which seek to halve food waste. In FY2019, Walmart Canada committed to achieve zero food waste by 2025.
The primary way we reduce food waste in our operations is by working to increase the sell-through rate. In the U.S., for example, we have strengthened our forecasting and ordering tools to improve inventory flow, adjusted store fixtures to increase turnover and customer appeal, made enhancements in our distribution centers, and provided our store associates with resources and education on how to better care for food and manage it at the end of shelf life. We are seeing results. In FY2019, we had 90 million fewer wasted units in our fresh departments in the U.S. as compared with last year.

We have also created a customized field-to-store network for highly perishable products, which is designed to reduce days in transit and increase freshness for customers. To support this network, we introduced specialized upstream nodes to consolidate

products, which allow fresh produce to move faster through every step of the transportation process. While decreasing inventory and waste, our produce moves through our Speed Fresh Supply Chain up to 1.8 days faster.
Additionally, in several markets, we adjust our product specifications to accept size and other cosmetic variations that don't affect the quality of fresh produce. For example, our Asda stores in the U.K. sell cosmetically imperfect, or "ugly," fruits and vegetables under a variety of labels. In FY2019, Asda sold more than a million boxes of this produce, avoiding 1.5 million pounds of waste.
In Canada, China, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. we offer discounts on food that is close to its expiration date, including meat, bakery, dry goods and dairy. In FY2019, we sold more than 320 million units through these programs in the U.S., saving our customers money and helping prevent food waste.
When food goes unpurchased, Walmart works to maximize its use by getting it to people and places

that need it. In addition to donating food to food banks and other charities, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation have donated funds to purchase equipment to increase the capacity of the charitable

1.6 BILLION

meal system to transport

and deliver fresh food. In FY2019, we donated

640 million pounds of food in the U.S. alone.

If food is no longer edible, we try to convert it to animal feed, compost or energy. Our Asda stores, for example, are recycling food into energy by taking inedible unsold food to anaerobic digestion plants, where it is broken down into gases that can be used as fuel and fertilizers.

In 2018, we diverted more than 1.6 billion pounds of food waste from landfills globally. We also received a B, the highest score among U.S. supermarkets assessed, in the Center for Biological Diversity's

study on food waste. The study reviewed American supermarkets' food waste reduction commitments, policies and actions.
Food waste in our value chain
We undertake efforts to help eliminate food waste in our value chains beyond our own operations. As noted above in the discussion of fresh supply chain improvements, our efforts include reducing days in the supply chain from point of origin to store.
As well, through Project Gigaton, Walmart is encouraging our suppliers to measure and report food waste; introduce reprocessing, donation and recycling practices; and standardize date labeling (when the date is required for quality reasons only) to eliminate customer confusion. In FY2018, 92% of our private-brand products in the U.S. used "Best If Used By" date labels unless a food safety or regulatory reason prevented us from doing so. Beyond our private-brand suppliers, we also advocate for other suppliers to standardize date labels across their brands in line with the Consumer Goods Forum's Date Labeling Call to Action.
For more information on our work to reduce food waste, please visit our Global responsibility website.

Philanthropy
The Walmart Foundation's philanthropic investments help drive system-wide change by investing in prevention efforts to stop food waste and loss from occurring, and the recovery and redistribution of edible food that would otherwise go to waste, specifically from farms and retail settings. The Walmart Foundation made a commitment to award $15 million to organizations that help reduce food waste and strengthen food banks in Canada from FY2017 through FY2020; more than $11 million has been allocated so far. The Walmart Foundation has also supported organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund in conducting research and analyzing policies that advance solutions for preventing food waste and loss.

Walmart engages in advocacy and coalitions to promote environmental public policy that aligns with our shared value business objectives. Examples include:
 We Are Still In: To promote the aims of the Paris Climate Agreement after the announcement of the U.S. withdrawal, Walmart joined an initiative called We Are Still In. This is a signal to world leaders that Americans will not retreat from the global pact to reduce emissions and stem the causes of climate change.
 Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance: We are members of this coalition that brings together purchasers and suppliers of renewable energy to make the process of transitioning to cleaner energy sources easier.
 Paris and Bonn negotiations: We participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conferences in 2015 and 2017 to collaborate with international stakeholders in advancing environmental issues around the world.

 Global Forest Watch Pro: To promote transparency and traceability across our supply chains, in 2017, Walmart joined the World Resources Institute and 20 other companies to launch Global Forest Watch Pro, an online platform that provides companies, banks and other stakeholders with data and tools for monitoring global forest loss because of the production of key commodities such as palm oil, soy and Brazilian beef.
 Consumer Goods Forum: We are a member and our CEO serves on its Board of Directors. This organization promotes collaboration between consumer goods retailers and manufacturers to drive positive change on issues such as climate change and forced labor.

Human rights

As Sam Walton created the company that has developed into the Walmart we know today, he wanted to provide customers access to affordable products, so they could save money to live better. He talked about wanting to "take care of our associates" and support the vision customers hold for their communities. While Sam used his own words, a respect for human rights corresponds with the core values he instilled in our company.
Human rights statement
For many years, our perspectives and initiatives that underscore our respect for human rights were described across a number of statements (e.g., Supplier Code of Conduct) and documents (e.g., Ethics and Compliance Report). In November 2018, we published Walmart's first Human Rights Statement, which consolidates our perspectives in one place.

As part of our work to develop our Human Rights Statement, we convened a cross-functional Steering Committee as well as a Working Group who:
 Reviewed a variety of international instruments including, but not limited to, the United Nations (U.N.) Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization's 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights
 Reviewed stakeholder feedback from research and consultations
 Obtained and incorporated feedback from human rights subject matter experts
 Considered analysis of Walmart conducted by a number of third parties, including Shift, Corporate Human Rights Benchmark, Know the Chain and Oxfam
 Reviewed the work of other companies, both those in our peer industry group and those that are considered leaders in human rights, to understand and compare their approach to ours

Our Human Rights Statement confirms our respect for human rights and articulates how our four values inform our approach to human rights throughout our corporate activities, with a focus on our associates, customers, supply chain and the communities in which we operate.
The statement was approved by the company's Board of Directors in 2018. We have shared it with associates via team meetings, presentations, social media and other outreach. After publication of this report, we expect to expand our communication efforts with our associates and suppliers.
Human rights: governance and implementation
In 2018, we launched a cross-functional Human Rights Steering Committee, comprised of Walmart leaders from Global Responsibility; Human Resources; Labor Relations; Responsible Sourcing; Culture, Diversity & Inclusion; Government Affairs; Communications; and Legal. This group oversees and guides our human rights approach at an enterprise level, which includes identifying our priority issues across the enterprise. In addition, this group provides a cross-functional perspective on the company's approach to ongoing implementation of our Human Rights Statement, such as through policies and procedures, and offers guidance and counsel to relevant stakeholders as part of that process.
The Steering Committee is supported by a Human Rights Working Group, which meets regularly and consists of members from each department as noted above. Last year, the Steering Committee and Working Group focused on:

 Developing our Human Rights Statement  Mapping the various policies and procedures
we have in place to help mitigate potential human rights issues
 Consulting a variety of human rights subject matter experts for their insights
 Identifying our salient human rights issues
We have identified several steps to continue advancing our work on human rights at Walmart, including:
 Assess potential adverse human rights impacts and the relevant processes in place
 Integrate relevant findings into policies and procedures
 Track progress as part of Walmart's efforts to continuously improve
 Communicate with relevant internal and external stakeholders for insight on our progress and priorities
 Adjust our human rights priorities as needed
External stakeholders
We value and routinely engage external stakeholders for their perspectives on human rights.
For example, as we developed our Human Rights Statement, we spoke with subject matter experts from BSR, Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, Institute for Human Rights and Business, New York University Stern Center for Business & Human Rights and Shift. We also engaged others through dialogue (e.g., Issara Institute and International Justice Mission through efforts combating forced labor) and forums (e.g., U.N. Business and Human Rights Conference, Concordia, and Consumer Goods Forum).

Salient human rights issues
To identify and prioritize our salient human rights, we reviewed issues and approaches described in several instruments, such as the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, as well as pertinent industry business disclosures. We then considered:
 Relevance to our company purpose  Key categories and markets  The potential scale of the human rights issue
 Walmart's ability to make a difference

Based upon our analysis, we have prioritized four salient human rights issues associated with our activities, each of which encompasses several aspects. This report provides more detail regarding our aspirations and initiatives.

SALIENT HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES
Treating workers with respect
Promoting a safe & healthy work environment
Providing a fair & inclusive work environment
Combating forced & underage labor

KEY ASPECTS
 Pay; working hours  Freedom of association and collective bargaining  Meaningful opportunities for workers to be heard
 Physical safety and security of work premises  Freedom from workplace abuse  Healthy work environments
 Prevention of discrimination and harassment  Diversity and inclusion  Gender equity

Grievance
Walmart employs several grievance mechanisms to solicit, assess and address the concerns of associates, customers, workers in the supply chain, people in communities where we operate and other stakeholders: anonymous hotlines; email and websites; direct engagement in small groups and surveys; a process we call "Open Door"; sentiment and content analysis of public social media postings; and assessment of facility audits.
We triage inquiries and allegations received through these channels, routing them to the appropriate teams for further consideration or action. In some cases, we open a formal investigation, using internal investigators or a third party, depending on the nature of the allegation. We work to see that concerns are appropriately addressed in a timely manner.
We also monitor the number and types of inquiries and allegations received through these and other channels. This information helps us to understand where we may need to strengthen policies or procedures.
We encourage stakeholders to raise concerns and to report activities they suspect may contravene the values and positions we express in our policies and statements. We will not retaliate against any party for raising concerns in good faith.
For additional information about the mechanisms we have in place to hear concerns, please visit the following sections of this report:
 Associate voice
 Sourcing responsibly
 Ethics & compliance

We are also mindful that human rights abuses can be the result of systemic issues, increasing the complexity of issue resolution. As an example, in 2013, Walmart was a founding member of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which provided extensive fire safety training; gave access to a 24hour, confidential helpline to report safety and other job-related concerns; and supported extensive remediation of factory safety issues. According to the Alliance's fifth annual report, 90% of high-priority remediation items were complete across all factories affiliated with the Alliance and nearly 1.6 million workers have been trained in fire safety. More than 1.5 million workers now have access to the 24-hour confidential helpline. While the Alliance's commitment ended in 2018, Walmart remains dedicated to worker safety in Bangladesh.
Walmart's next steps
In this next year, we expect to:
 Continue to broadly communicate our Human Rights Statement with our associates and suppliers as well as customers and the communities in which we operate so that they may be familiar with the concepts and values within it.
 Continue to engage human rights thought leaders and stakeholders to help us advance our initiatives and improve our effectiveness.
 Continue to develop our reporting, as we learn more about what our associates and stakeholders would like to know.

Retail opportunity

One of society's greatest challenges is helping workers gain the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the jobs of today and prepare for the jobs of tomorrow.
Today, millions of jobs are left unfilled as employers struggle to find workers with the skills needed to fill open positions. In the coming decades, growth in automation will likely exacerbate the skill development challenge as technology drives rapid change in the types of jobs available for workers and the capabilities they need to fulfill those roles.
The retail sector -- as a foundational entry point to work, a place to gain valuable skills and a significant portion of the overall job market -- provides a gateway to upward mobility for millions of people and can help address the global need for workforce development. Recognizing this, Walmart is committed to helping make retail a place of opportunity: a launching pad for people to acquire the skills and experience needed to advance in the workforce.

Retail opportunity at Walmart
Walmart offers a wide variety of career opportunities, low barriers to entry, competitive wages and benefits, and paths to advancement through onthe-job coaching, training and education. By helping associates acquire the skills they need to advance, we aim to offer a distinctive employee value proposition among retailers.
Our workforce philosophy is formed around three foundational pillars -- access to employment, stability and mobility -- designed to lead people from entry to opportunity while forging a model for addressing global workforce development challenges. We're seeing the results of this approach in the U.S.:
 Turnover in our Walmart U.S. stores is down more than 10% or 1000 bps -- the lowest level in five years
 Nearly three out of four associates would refer friends or family to Walmart for employment
 As of year-end FY2019, we promoted more than 215,000 associates to jobs with more responsibility and higher pay in Walmart U.S. stores
 As of FY2019, more than 75% of our store operations management team members began as hourly associates
 On average, a Walmart store manager makes $175,000 per year
Access to employment
Entry-level jobs provide economic opportunity and a pathway to upward mobility for many people. Such pathways are especially critical at a time when, according to the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce, job opportunities for lower-skilled workers across the U.S. economy have decreased.

Walmart provides jobs for over

ONE

1 million people

MILLION+ in

the U.S. (and over

U.S. jobs provided

2 million worldwide).

For many of our

entry-level hourly positions, we do not require

degrees and we have "banned the box" to lower

barriers to entering the workforce. And we provide

opportunities for associates to learn important

and transferable job skills, advance their education,

and even gain college credit -- all while earning

a paycheck.

Stability
In addition to providing an entry to employment, we strive to help associates maintain job stability so they are encouraged to stay with Walmart and are positioned to grow their skills and knowledge on the job. For example, in the U.S., we aim to do this by providing competitive pay and benefits, enhancing scheduling, and improving job design, leveraging technology to make jobs more rewarding. In a U.S. associate survey from FY2019, 74% shared that they feel they were able to plan or request their schedule far enough in advance to balance their work and personal life. Specific stability initiatives in the U.S. include the following:
Pay
 We have raised our starting wages in the U.S. by more than 50% over the past three years.
 100% of our U.S. associates earn above the federal minimum wage (which is currently $7.25/hour); newly hired associates start at $11 per hour or more, while key department manager roles can earn as much as $24.70 per hour.

 The average wage of a full-time, hourly field associate in our Walmart U.S. stores as of March 2019, is $14.26 per hour.36
 Average total compensation and benefits for a full-time, hourly field associate in our Walmart U.S. stores is $19.31 per hour, including wages, bonuses, and benefits such as paid time off.37
 In FY2019, $793 million in bonuses were delivered to full- and part-time hourly associates in our Walmart U.S. stores.
 Financial planning tools: Using the Even app, our associates can access tools to help them plan for bills and savings goals, eliminating the work of figuring out how much money is okay to spend. When unexpected expenses occur, our associates can access earned wages ahead of scheduled paychecks using an "Instapay" feature. The tools are available to all hourly and salaried Walmart, Sam's Club and Walmart U.S. eCommerce associates. As of February 2019, 600,000 associates used the Even app.

Benefits
 Healthcare: Walmart offers health benefits starting at around $26 per pay period for all full- and part-time associates who have worked an average of 30 hours per week over the past 12 months. This is about 40% less than the national average cost for singleperson coverage.
 401(k): We offer 401(k) contributions and provide full- and part-time hourly U.S. associates a match of up to 6% after one year on the job. Associates are eligible to contribute to their 401(k) on their first day of work.
 Paid time off (PTO): Walmart's U.S. PTO policy streamlines paid vacation, sick time, personal time and holiday time into one category. In February 2019, we introduced protected PTO, where not required by paid sick leave laws, allowing our associates to earn up to 48 hours of paid time that can be used anytime to cover scheduled shifts when they are unexpectedly not able to make it to work.
 Expanded parental leave, covering U.S. salaried and fulltime hourly associates: Walmart provides associates with parental leave, as well as assistance with adoption expenses.
-- The parental benefit supports associates who become parents through birth, adoption or fostercare placement with up to six weeks of protected paid time away from work.
-- Birth moms can receive 16 weeks of total paid time away when maternity and parental are combined (10 weeks of maternity and six weeks of parental leave).
-- These changes create parity for maternity and parental leave benefits among salaried and fulltime hourly associates.

Scheduling
 More than 50% of hourly associates in our Walmart U.S. stores are full-time.
 Predictable scheduling: We recently improved schedule predictability with a new system based on a method called core hours. Associates with core-hour schedules normally work the same weekly shifts for at least 13 weeks, enabling them to plan and prioritize important responsibilities outside of work.
 Flexible scheduling: In November 2018, we rolled out My Walmart Schedule, a system that allows associates to view schedules, swap shifts with other associates and pick up unfilled shifts.
Evolving job design
Meeting customer demand for new and better experiences requires changes to jobs, new associate skills, and redesign of store processes and systems.
Even as technology enables efficiencies in some areas, we're creating new opportunities and training associates to lead in others. We have more than 35,000 people working in our U.S. stores in roles that didn't exist two years ago. Some of those roles include personal shoppers for Online Grocery Pickup, self-checkout hosts and customer hosts. We're also providing associates with tools that help them do their jobs such as AI-powered FAST Unloaders that make unloading trucks more efficient, which can enable associates who previously spent large portions of their shifts unloading trucks to learn new skills such as customer service and merchandising.

Training programs
Walmart U.S. offers all associates the opportunity to gain critical skills for job advancement, including language training and professional development. We also offer two structured training programs for associates at Walmart U.S. stores: Pathways and The Walmart Academy.

Building foundational skills through Pathways
Our Pathways training program helps associates gain vital retail job skills, including customer service, merchandising, teamwork and communications. The program leverages self-paced, computer-based learning and mentoring from supervisors who provide feedback on associates' job performance and highlight potential career opportunities. More than 850,000 associates have completed the Pathways program since its inception.
Building advanced skills through Walmart Academy
Walmart Academy offers hands-on, immersive learning, combining technology, classroom training and ongoing coaching on the sales floor. Using cutting-edge handheld devices and virtual reality, the program prepares associates for jobs as frontline hourly supervisors, department managers and assistant managers. Associates are paid for the time spent in training.
In the last three years, Walmart has opened nearly 200 Academies in the U.S., most within an hour's drive of a Walmart store, and each Academy serves approximately 25 nearby stores. In FY2019 alone, we trained about 450,000 associates through Walmart Academy.
Education opportunities
Walmart offers education benefits for General Educational Development (GED) certification, high school completion and college credit through an innovative approach to higher education that focuses on meeting the distinct needs of the adult working learner.

In June 2018, Walmart teamed up with Guild Education to offer associates the opportunity to earn their high school diploma at no cost to them and a college degree for $1 per day. That means Walmart will subsidize the cost of higher education, beyond financial aid and an associate contribution equivalent to $1 per day. Available to all U.S. Walmart and Sam's Club associates, the program offers access to both associate's and bachelor's degrees from three university partners, chosen based on their success with adult working learners. Associates can earn their associate's degree in an area of their choice and a bachelor's degree in business management and supply chain management. Associates have access to a counselor to help them navigate the application process and stick with the program. More than 1,500 students began classes in Fall 2018 across three university partners.
Employees have taken notice of these opportunities, according to associate engagement surveys that Walmart conducts at least annually. In our most recent FY2019 U.S. associate engagement results, 81% of associates agreed with the statement, "I have the training necessary to perform my job well." This reflects our increased investment in employee training. We are seeing additional benefits from our investments, as shown by the fact that the majority of our associates also agreed with the statement, "I see a clear path for my career growth at Walmart." Finally, the survey also confirms that nearly 75% of our associates would refer friends or family to Walmart for employment.

Associate voice
At Walmart, we aim to create a collaborative environment where associates are free to respectfully express their opinions and feel that their concerns are heard. We want associates to share their ideas for making our business better and relay, in confidence when appropriate, any workplace concerns. To that end, we gather and respond to associates' feedback in a variety of ways, including, for example, in the U.S.:
 Personal, one-on-one interactions
 Team meetings
 Cascaded leadership communications
 Company intranet
 Facebook Workplace and other social media channels
 Traditional digital communications, such as email
Senior operations executives also conduct formal listening tours twice a year with associates across the U.S. Additional annual company gatherings include the Year Beginning Meeting, Holiday Meeting and Shareholders' Associate Week. Our U.S. CEO also holds quarterly town hall meetings with associates and weekly operations feedback calls with store managers. During these sessions, any action items are assigned to field and home office associates, including officers, who are responsible for addressing each one.
These engagement efforts have led to meaningful improvements in company policies. Through various lines of communication, our U.S. associates asked

Walmart to consider changes such as expanding our parental leave, bonuses for work attendance and a PTObased time-off system so they would not incur penalties for sick leave. Walmart U.S. responded by implementing these practices.
Walmart's Open Door process is another resource that allows any associate -- from entry level to the C-suite -- to share ideas and raise an issue in good faith at any time without fear of reprisal.
Additional information on our Open Door policy, including our stance against retaliation for concerns raised in good faith, as well as guidance for our associates on when and how to use these resources, can be found in our Statement of Ethics.
Confidential resources
In addition to the communication avenues described above, employees have access to a variety of confidential resources.
To ask a question or report an ethics violation, employees can contact Walmart Global Ethics at www.WalmartEthics.com, via email at ethics@walmart.com or 1-800-WM-ETHIC in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada. Our Statement of Ethics outlines resources available globally. Walmart strictly forbids retaliation against any associate who reports a concern in good faith. Reports can be made anonymously and will be treated as confidential.

Freedom of association
One of our enduring core values since Sam Walton founded the company is Respect for the Individual.
Our associate freedom of association position
Consistent with applicable law and practice, Walmart respects the rights of associates to join, form or not to join an employee association or trade union of their choice without interference. Associates should exercise these rights in an informed manner, and with the benefit of thoughtful consideration and available information. In the exercise of these rights, we believe in the free exchange of ideas, opinions and information, provided there is no interference.
These rights are defined under applicable national law and practice in the countries in which Walmart operates and from which Walmart sources the products we sell.

Globally, Walmart has associates who are represented by some form of collective bargaining in more than half of the 27 markets where we operate. The U.S. model is employee choice.
Fostering inclusion
Our people and culture help make Walmart successful. We are committed to building a diverse workforce that represents the more than approximately 275 million customers who choose to shop with us instore or online every week. A variety of perspectives enriches our culture, leads to innovative solutions for our business and enables us to better meet the needs of a diverse customer base. We aim to develop inclusive leaders and an inclusive culture, while also growing the pipeline of women and people of color at every level. Walmart is a signatory to Catalyst CEO Champions for Change, CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion and Paradigm for Parity.
Walmart's work to create a more inclusive company has been recognized by indices such as the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, the

Disability Equality Index and the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, among others.
A truly inclusive workplace culture is one where all associates feel empowered to bring their authentic selves to work every day.

Our approach
To foster diversity and inclusion within Walmart, we focus on recruitment, development and retention. We seek to develop equity in representation and an inclusive culture and to confirm our commitment to fair-pay practices. An important component of fostering inclusion is raising awareness about unconscious bias. We have developed unconscious bias training for associates across the organization. All officers have Inclusive Leadership Expectations as part of their annual performance evaluation. A component of these expectations is abiding by our Statement of Ethics, failure of which may result in an annual cash incentive pay reduction. For more information, please see our Culture Diversity & Inclusion (CDI) Report.

Measuring progress
Using engagement survey feedback, metrics on representation and inclusion indices, we're measuring our progress and informing future priorities. Introduced in 2016, our CDI scorecard has proven to be a valuable tool, providing a biannual, actionable report that is reviewed by senior management.
Fair pay
Fairness in pay is an important issue for our company. We are committed to creating a performance culture where associates are rewarded based on meaningful factors such as qualifications, experience, performance and the type of work they do.
Our compensation plans and practices are designed to comply with applicable laws that require companies to pay their employees fairly and equitably. In the U.S., for example, relevant laws include Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Equal Pay Act, both of which require that men and women be given equal pay for equal work. Salary and wage ranges for our associates are based on objective factors, regardless of gender or race. We continually review our processes to make sure we are living up to our commitment to fair-pay practices.

Walmart's supply chain reaches more than 100,000 suppliers globally. In 1992, we launched our Responsible Sourcing program to establish our expectation that suppliers and their facilities operate responsibly, in a way that protects worker dignity. We set expectations through our Standards for Suppliers and use a riskbased approach to monitoring our supply chain, focusing audits on those geographies with greater potential risks.
We also collaborate with peers and other industry stakeholders to address human rights issues in complex supply chains and to improve the capacity of the global retail sourcing system. Recognizing the need for whole-system transformation, Walmart has committed to use our ability to bring together stakeholders including industries, civil society, governments and international organizations to address the major potential risks to the dignity of workers in a minimum of 10 retail supply chains by 2025.

We communicate our fundamental expectations to suppliers on social conditions, worker safety and integrity in the workplace through our Standards for Suppliers. Suppliers must agree to the Standards as part of their Supplier Agreement with Walmart. The Standards apply to anyone that supplies product to Walmart for resale, as well as any agents they use. Among other obligations, the Standards require our suppliers, and those who supply to them, to:
 Comply with the law
 Be transparent in their production for Walmart
 Not use involuntary or underage labor
 Maintain a fair process for making employment decisions
 Comply with all applicable laws and agreements regarding compensation and working hours
 Respect the principles of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining
 Provide a safe work environment

We provide tools and resources for suppliers through the Responsible Sourcing Academy, which includes training, best practices, and educational materials developed by third parties and Walmart. More than 4,300 supplier representatives have registered in the Responsible Sourcing Academy.
Monitoring
Through our risk-based monitoring program, we use third-party audits to evaluate supply chain practices against our Standards. After assessing the standards, protocols, governance and integrity of each program, the Responsible Sourcing team approved nine thirdparty audit programs. In addition, we work with the audit programs to make enhancements and share best practices for the benefit of the broader supply chain. To determine where regular audits will be required, we assign countries a classification of their potential social compliance risk level based on the World Bank governance indicators. Facilities in countries that fall into the highest level of risk -- which are identified as Category 2 and Category 3 countries -- are subject to

regular audits. Facilities in Category 1 countries, such as the U.S., are subject to audits on a sample basis.

Risk-based social compliance audit assessments
We take a risk-based approach to auditing, which allocates more resources to facilities located in countries with greater potential risks; facilities in higher-risk countries are required to submit regular audits, while facilities in lower-risk countries are audited on a sample basis. Facilities submit an approved third-party audit to Walmart, which we assess against our standards. In FY2019, we assessed more than 14,700 audits.

Facilities for which we found general compliance.
Facilities that audits show to be generally compliant with our Standards but have failed to meet at least one important requirement. In these cases, we ask the facility to remediate noncompliances found in the audit report.

Facilities participating in our small supplier program and therefore did not receive a color rating.

Walmart reviews each facility audit and assigns a color rating based on the third-party program's ability to produce product for Walmart evaluation and Walmart's own assessment of that evaluation. Green ratings represent facilities for which we found general compliance. Yellow ratings identify facilities that audits show to be generally compliant with our Standards but have failed to meet at least one important requirement. In these cases, we ask the facility to remediate noncompliances found in the audit report. Orange ratings identify facilities whose audits indicate more serious violations of the Standards, but from which Walmart will continue to allow sourcing while the violations are remediated. Red ratings identify facilities for which Responsible Sourcing has discovered violations of a nature that may make it appropriate to temporarily or

permanently terminate the facility's ability to produce product for Walmart.
Walmart reviews and assesses each audit report. Of the more than 14,700 thirdparty audit reports Walmart reviewed and assessed in FY2019, 23.7% received green, 63.1% received yellow, 10.8% received orange and 0.3% received red. An additional 2.1% of audits were for facilities participating in our small supplier program and, therefore, did not receive a color rating.
In addition, Walmart operates several grievance mechanisms to solicit the concerns of workers in the supply chain. These include:
 Global helpline: Walmart provides global and local phone numbers that anyone can use to ask questions and report concerns related to Walmart's business, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

The helpline is equipped to handle most local languages spoken in each of the retail markets where we operate.
 Global email address: This email address is available for reporting concerns, asking questions, or simply seeking guidance for situations that may be unclear. All contacts are received by Walmart's Global Ethics and Compliance team in Bentonville, Arkansas.
 WalmartEthics.com: This website is available in 13 languages and accessible globally. It provides a platform where stakeholders can ask questions, read our Statement of Ethics, submit ethical concerns and follow up on previously reported concerns.

Cases resulting from these grievance mechanisms, as well as from audits and internal referrals, can be referred to our Responsible Sourcing Investigations or other compliance teams within Walmart. In FY2019, our Responsible Sourcing team opened more than 600 cases involving allegations of supply chain misconduct. Each case is reviewed and may include worker interviews, on-site visits and follow up with audit programs. Responsible Sourcing may also engage with the supplier directly, which typically includes a discussion regarding the allegations; a clarification of expectations; and the review, approval and follow up with the supplier on a corrective action plan. In FY2019, Walmart used this issue response process for more than 65 cases. Reports of misconduct ranged from issues such as lack of required posters to more serious violations that warranted in-depth scrutiny.
We believe that staying engaged with suppliers through dialogue and corrective plans can have a more positive impact than simply abandoning the supplier relationship -- and in FY2019, more than 480 facilities remediated from orange to either yellow or green assessments. However, substantiated findings may result in consequences for suppliers, facilities or both -- up to and including termination of business with Walmart and its subsidiaries. Since 2012, we have stopped doing business with more than 30 suppliers in response to serious violations of our Standards.
Learn more about Supplier Standards at our Responsible Sourcing website.
Strengthening capacity of global audit systems
Many of the challenges we seek to address in our global supply chains are not unique to Walmart,

and we are collaborating with our peers and key stakeholders to strengthen and standardize expectations for suppliers to drive transformation across supply chains. For instance, to help improve capacity of supply chain audits, Walmart and other stakeholders -- including third-party audit firms and other companies who rely on social compliance audits, audit programs and non-governmental organizations (NGO) -- established the Association of Professional Social Compliance Auditors (APSCA). The APSCA aims to increase the credibility and professionalism of auditors and audit programs across the industry. In 2018, the APSCA developed a Code of Professional Conduct and a Competency Framework for Auditors, and the group began piloting its certification process. As of January 31, 2019, more than 3,200 auditors have registered with the APSCA.
Collaborative efforts to address systemic issues
For certain risks, supply chain monitoring and supplier engagement can only go so far. Long-term social sustainability in complex, global supply chains requires whole-system transformation and collective action of suppliers, NGOs, governments, retailers and others. Walmart has committed to work with others to address potential risks to the dignity of workers in a minimum of 10 retail supply chains by 2025; so far, we have focused on five supply chain initiatives:
 Apparel in Bangladesh
 Produce in the U.S. and Mexico
 Shrimp in Thailand
 Tuna processed in Thailand
 Electronics sourced for the U.S. retail market supply chain

To help prioritize key geographies and supply chains, we analyzed internal data, audit findings and other external resources such as the World Bank global indices and government and media reports. We also considered where Walmart could have the biggest impact and identified collaborators that could help effect change.
In such whole-system, collaborative efforts, Walmart engages through business and philanthropic initiatives that include:
 Clarifying expectations with suppliers
 Investing in research to understand prevalence of human rights violations and track progress toward improvement
 Engaging with governments to advocate for laws, regulations and enforcement
 Collaborating with key stakeholders and thought leaders in task forces and consortia
 Building capacity in critical parts of the system (e.g., responsible recruitment, worker communication tools and monitoring technology)
To gain deeper insight into these chains and the day-to-day experiences of workers, our associates also conduct on-site visits; cross-functional teams from Walmart undertook several such visits in 2018. Such on-site visits not only improve our ability to collaborate on whole-system change initiatives, they also help us improve our merchandising and responsible sourcing practices.
Two human rights issues that we are particularly focused on through our responsible sourcing work and collaborative initiatives are forced labor and worker safety.

Forced labor
Walmart has prioritized working with others to combat forced labor in the global supply chain. Example efforts include:
 Responsible recruitment: As a member of the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment, Walmart works to create demand for ethically recruited workers in Thailand and Malaysia and advocate for better government regulation of recruitment agencies.
 Seafood Task Force: Since 2015 we have participated in this international, multistakeholder initiative to address forced labor and illegal fishing in the Thai seafood supply chain. The Seafood Task Force has developed supply chain maps, established a system to track products across the supply chain, worked with government and industry stakeholders to improve regulation and codes of conduct, and championed fishery improvement projects. In FY2019, the Task Force Board approved the Vessel Auditable Standards, which extend auditing practices and performance expectations to fishing boats, beyond ports and land-based monitoring. Walmart also participates in the Tuna subgroup.
 Immersive field visits: These visits help Walmart teams better understand complex forced labor issues in supply chains such as tuna. For example, a team comprised of Global Sourcing, Responsible Sourcing, Sustainability and Corporate Affairs visited Thailand and the Marshall Islands to explore the canned tuna supply chain. The team visited tuna boats, met workers, interviewed captains, saw processing plants and canning facilities, and observed unloading and loading processes.
The Walmart Foundation also aims to decrease the risk of forced labor through philanthropic investments focused on: (1) strengthening demand

for responsible labor and practices; (2) using data and technology to increase transparency; (3) enhancing worker and community voice; and (4) supporting efforts to improve enforcement of existing regulations. For example, in FY2019, the Walmart Foundation provided support to FishWise to develop the Roadmap for Improving Seafood Ethics (RISE), an online platform that details steps companies can take to improve responsible practices in seafood supply chains. By providing tailored recommendations to producers, processors, brands and retailers on how to build, assess and improve social practices -- and track progress toward more ethical performance -- RISE can help drive advancements in worker dignity in fishing supply chains around the world.
As another example, in 2016, the Walmart Foundation made a grant to International Justice Mission (IJM), building upon funding from other institutions, to help open the IJM Bangkok office to work alongside the Royal Thai Government as it combats human trafficking networks in the Thai fishing industry. Learn more at Walmart.org.
Walmart also supports the nonprofit Truckers Against Trafficking, which trains and encourages transportation professionals to recognize and report suspected human trafficking incidents. In 2015, Walmart conducted a training initiative with its private fleet drivers in the identification and prevention of human trafficking. In FY2020, Walmart plans to incorporate that same training into its newdriver onboarding process.
Worker safety
We expect our suppliers to provide a safe working environment. To address systemic issues affecting worker conditions more broadly, we collaborate with other companies, NGOs and experts. For example, in 2013, Walmart was a founding member of the Alliance

for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which provided extensive fire safety training; gave access to a 24hour, confidential helpline to report safety and other job-related concerns; and supported remediation of factory safety issues. According to the Alliance's fifth annual report, 90% of high-priority remediation items were complete across all factories affiliated with the Alliance, and nearly 1.6 million workers have been trained in fire safety. More than 1.5 million workers now have access to the 24-hour confidential helpline. While the Alliance's commitment ended in 2018, Walmart remains dedicated to worker safety in Bangladesh.

QUICK FACTS
Walmart and Sam's Clubs sourced more than $11 billion from diverse suppliers38 in the U.S.

According to data from our suppliers, approximately two-thirds of what we spend to buy products for Walmart U.S. goes toward items that are made, sourced or grown in the U.S.

We use the power of our purchase order as a development tool in two ways: to promote diverse suppliers and to support small producers in emerging markets.
Diverse sourcing
Our supplier inclusion statement, signed by Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, highlights our belief that a diverse supply chain enables us to deliver better products and a broader selection to the communities we serve.
Walmart does business with more than 2,800 diverse suppliers39 who represent products in Walmart stores and on Walmart.com. In the U.S., Walmart and Sam's Club sourced more than $11 billion from diverse suppliers in FY2019. Of this, $10.6 billion was for merchandising and $1.2 billion was for other goods and professional services.

We are also a member of the Billion Dollar Roundtable, which celebrates corporations that achieve spending of at least $1 billion with diverse businesses and adhere to the classification and reporting standards established by this organization.
Using the National Minority Supplier Development Council's and Women's Business Enterprise National Council's standard diverse business ownership definitions as benchmarks, we track diversity in our supply chain under the following diverse classifications: Women, African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Native Alaskans, members of the LGBT community, veterans, disabled veterans and other people with disabilities.

Market access for smallholders in emerging markets
Walmart works to help develop small suppliers in countries around the globe, enabling them to establish their businesses as part of the regional retail supply chain. Beyond Walmart's supply chain, the Walmart Foundation invests in programs to help enhance livelihoods for produce growers in Mexico, smallplot farmers in India and small enterprises in South Africa. For example, in India where smallholder farmers represent the backbone of the country's economy, the Walmart Foundation, working beyond Walmart's supply chain, made a commitment in 2018 to invest $25 million over the next five years to improve farmer livelihoods. At the same time, Walmart India has committed to source 25% of produce sold in its Cash & Carry stores from India's smallholder farmers.
When the Walmart Foundation seeks out market access programs to support, we focus our funding on programs that help address women's inclusion and empowerment. We ask about the design of projects and disaggregating data to understand any disproportionate impacts on program participants.

Investing in American jobs
Our U.S. customers and communities are passionate about supporting American manufacturing. In 2013, we announced our goal of purchasing an additional $250 billion in products that will support American jobs through 2023. According to Boston Consulting Group, this initiative could create 1 million new U.S. jobs, including 250,000 manufacturing jobs directly, and 750,000 support and service sector jobs indirectly. We have achieved 94% of what we had initially estimated for this point and we are making steady progress across categories.
To raise awareness of our initiative and encourage suppliers to identify new product opportunities, Walmart hosted the fifth annual Open Call for new U.S.-made products in June 2018. Entrepreneurs from 46 states participated in more than 500 meetings where they had an opportunity to pitch their products for Walmart stores.
We have also:
 Published the Policy Roadmap to Renew U.S. Manufacturing, outlining what government, manufacturers and retailers can do to create manufacturing areas of opportunity.
 Released a report on the future of work in the U.S. on a county-by-county basis.
 Established the Jobs in U.S. Manufacturing Portal for suppliers to access our knowledge base on the U.S. manufacturing industry.
According to data from our suppliers, approximately two-thirds of what we spend to buy products for Walmart U.S. goes toward items that are made, sourced or grown in the U.S.

Food
Food safety
As the world's largest grocer, we are committed to playing a leading role in upholding food safety laws and regulations applicable to our global businesses, and to providing access to safe, high-quality foods. We helped found the Global Food Safety Initiative, and we are guided by our Food Safety Policy. Our Global Food Safety Compliance team includes food safety professionals who are responsible for overseeing a comprehensive Food Safety program in every market where we operate.
To reduce food-safety-related risk in our supply chain, we require all private-brand suppliers and select categories of national-brand suppliers to achieve certification to one of the Global Food Safety Initiative's internationally recognized food safety standards, which often exceed applicable regulatory requirements.
Since the initial rollout of this requirement, more than 4,990 food facilities that provide products to Walmart stores and Sam's Clubs have been certified. Studies published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Food Protection have shown that Global Food Safety Initiative certification tends to help suppliers in strengthening their ability to produce safe foods and comply with regulations.
We also strive to improve transparency and the traceability of the products we carry through technology such as blockchain. For example, Walmart China, working with IBM and Jinluo Meat Co., completed a proofofconcept pilot that dramatically reduced the time needed to trace select pork products back to the farm using blockchain. And, in the wake of E. coli outbreaks in 2018, Walmart U.S. asked our existing suppliers of

leafy greens (e.g., romaine lettuce and spinach) to use blockchain technology to trace their products back to the farms where they originated.

Blockchain technology has the potential to shine a light on all actors in the food system. This enhanced transparency can result in greater accountability, improved safety and more sustainable practices.

Through regular independent, third-party food safety audits of our stores and clubs that prepare fresh food, we assess adherence to Walmart food safety standards, processes, conditions and expected behaviors. These risk-based audits help us receive independent assurances that our stores are operating in a safe and legal manner.

In FY2019, we conducted

more than 140,000 independent food safety audits at our stores and clubs globally.
In October 2016,

Healthier food for all
We aim to make healthier food more affordable and more easily accessible. We continue to work toward improving the nutritional quality of our U.S. private-brand products.
To help customers more easily identify more nutritious food options, we worked with regulators and experts to develop the Great for You icon. Products identified with the Great for You icon have met nutrition criteria informed by the latest science and guidance from the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture and Institute of Medicine. The Great for You initiative has been recognized by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation as a leading nutrition program. For more information, please visit the Great for You section of our website.

Philanthropy
Walmart and the Walmart Foundation have made substantial investments designed to improve access to and availability of healthier food and increase people's confidence to select, prepare and serve healthier food. Through Walmart's food donations and additional philanthropic investments from Walmart and the Walmart Foundation, we met the goal we set in FY2014 to provide 4 billion meals to people in need by 2020, largely through the donation of unsold food. As of November 2018, we had also put funding in place to reach 4 million people with nutrition education. In FY2019, Walmart stores, clubs and distribution centers in the U.S. donated more than 640 million pounds of food, over 55% of which was fruits, vegetables and meat. Globally, Walmart donated a total of 720 million pounds of food in FY2019.
For more information on our hunger relief and nutrition education efforts, please visit Walmart.org.

Product safety
We are committed to providing our customers and members with access to safe and affordable merchandise. We require our suppliers to meet all applicable laws, regulations and company-specific requirements for all items offered for sale.
These laws and regulations help ensure that products sold to consumers meet design, manufacturing and safety standards to reduce the risk of harm to customers. Our Product Safety Compliance team has implemented product-safety-related processes and procedures, which include:
 Monitoring laws, regulations, and standards
 Creating and communicating product requirements
 Assessing supplier and product performance
 Item testing, verification, and monitoring
 Managing incident reports, product removals, and regulatory reporting

Sustainable chemistry
Launched in 2013, our Sustainable Chemistry Initiative sets ambitious goals for product formulation and transparency, covering approximately 125,000 personal care, beauty, baby, pet and household cleaning products sold by Walmart and Sam's Club stores in the U.S.
Our current Sustainable Chemistry Commitment outlines how we are working to incorporate the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry. The commitment asks suppliers to accelerate product reformulation, improve ingredient transparency and certify products using credible accreditations such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Safer Choice program.
Last year, we became the first U.S. retailer to announce a time-bound chemical footprint reduction goal and set a commitment to report annually to the Chemical Footprint Project. Our consumables chemical footprint is based on Walmart's Priority Chemical list and includes chemicals such as formaldehyde and phthalates. By 2022, we aim to reduce the chemical footprint in personal care, beauty, baby, pet and household cleaning categories in U.S. stores by 10%. Our baseline for this goal is our calendar year 2017 footprint of approximately 190 million pounds for Walmart U.S. and approximately 30 million pounds for Sam's Club. We made this baseline public in 2018.

In February 2019, we expanded our sustainable

Through our Healthcare Begins Here platform we offer customers health insurance education and enrollment services in stores, online and via call centers during annual enrollment periods for Medicare and Affordable Care Act plans.
For more information, including our Health and Wellness Policy, please visit our Health and Wellness compliance website and Health and Wellness blog.
Opioids
Opioid abuse and dependence are a serious public health issue that touches our communities, patients and associates. Walmart is committed to taking a leadership role on this issue and has developed a comprehensive opioid stewardship initiative with policies, programs and tools aimed at helping prevent opioid abuse and dependence.
Walmart and Sam's Club limit the initial opioid prescription for an acute condition (one expected

to heal fairly quickly) to 7 days -- informed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines. This limit helps reduce the number of pills dispensed, which both reduces the likelihood that the patient will become dependent upon opioids and reduces the volume of opioids that could be diverted for inappropriate uses by someone other than the patient.
Walmart and Sam's Club pharmacists participate in opioid-related training programs and use their knowledge to educate patients on the risks of opioid use and to recommend the overdose medication, naloxone, for patients who may be at risk for overdose. Certain patients can be at risk of overdose even when using an opioid for a legitimate medical purpose. We also invest in drug education programs for youth in our communities. We offer a free, athome opioid disposal product to patients.
These are just a few of the ways Walmart is working to address opioid abuse and misuse, and we are committed to adding new initiatives and partnerships to continue to serve as a corporate leader and partner to our communities.

In the U.S., for example, before we open a new store, club or distribution center, Walmart meets with stakeholders such as community groups, chambers of commerce, elected officials and local chapters of national organizations to understand the needs of the neighborhood. In some instances, we convene community discussions on opportunities and challenges.
We encourage our store leaders to engage in community life. In addition to charitable giving, our store leaders may host events for community leaders' networks, serve on the boards of local nonprofits, speak at local events, and belong to community organizations such as chambers

We engage with our stakeholders as outlined below:
Associates
Our associates are the core of our business, and we engage with them in a variety of ways including: personal one-on-one interaction, team meetings, cascaded leadership communications, company intranet, Facebook Workplace and other social media, as well as traditional digital communications such as email. We use the feedback we receive from our associates to understand the issues that are paramount to them, and we try to respond as effectively as possible.
Transparency and communication are key to driving Walmart's internal culture of trust, and we are committed to continual improvement in these efforts. For more on how we engage with our associates and integrate their feedback into the business, see our Associate voice section.

Customers
Understanding the needs of our customers is a top priority. We use a variety of channels to solicit feedback and communicate with our customers. These include:
 Focused research through surveys and inperson discussions
 Social media interaction through managed Facebook and Twitter pages
 In-person communication in our stores
 Outreach through email and phone, as well as communication through our customer call centers
We have listened to our customers' questions regarding topics such as product country of origin, nutrition profile of foods, ingredients and responsible sourcing, and are working to respond to their preferences.

Suppliers and others in the supply chain
An important lever in achieving the system-wide change we aspire to is the power of our purchase orders and our relationships with our suppliers. Therefore, we use multiple channels to communicate with them. We engage with our suppliers to share our standards and expectations; provide trainings; receive their feedback and input on a variety of topics; and help improve the sustainability of supply chains. For example:
 Walmart's Responsible Sourcing Academy houses information about our standards for worker safety in factories, training, best practices and educational materials developed by third parties and by Walmart.
 We provide additional outreach and support for minority- and women-owned businesses to increase the diversity of our supplier pipeline.

 We host a variety of live and online events, communicate at trade events and keep in close communication with suppliers via timely updates.
 We encourage suppliers to report through the Sustainability Index, a science-based, third-party tool developed by The Sustainability Consortium in collaboration with universities, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and suppliers.
For more information on how we interact with our suppliers, please see the Responsible supply chains, Project Gigaton and the Sustainable chemistry sections of this report.
Communities
At Walmart, we work hard to support the communities where we operate and where our associates and customers live. See the Communities section of this report for more information.
Shareholders
We engage with shareholders through:
 Formal communications: Quarterly earnings materials, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, investor conferences, investment community meetings, annual live earnings call with the investment community, our annual report to shareholders, our annual proxy statement and other information made available via our corporate website
 Shareholder outreach programs: Shareholder outreach is conducted during the year to discuss corporate governance, executive compensation and other matters related to Walmart's enterprise strategy
 Walmart resources: Our website and hotline

During these engagements, we provide updates on our corporate strategy, recent operational and financial results, competitive landscape, Board composition and governance, executive compensation and ESG initiatives. We hear diverse perspectives from our investors on Board governance, and we provide this shareholder feedback to our Nominating and Governance Committee.
Governments
The guiding principle for Walmart's government engagement is to promote public policy that fulfills the interests of our customers and the public as well as our business. We believe that sound public policy is the result of good-faith government and stakeholder actions that promote the intersection of those interests. Whether the issue involves federal or state taxation, trade, technology or policies related to the workforce of the future, we advocate with a view toward the long-term interests of our associates, our customers and the communities in which we work and live. We are committed to providing substantive and technical input and advice to legislative bodies and executive agencies across all issues where we have expertise and make it a practice to do so in ways that build relationships of trust.
NGOs, advisory councils and grantees
Many problems facing the world today, from deforestation to human trafficking, are beyond the scope of any single organization to resolve. Because we aim to create lasting impact and system-wide change, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation collaborate with leading third parties to help solve complex problems.

We have direct dialogue with many institutions -- both our critics and advocates -- to understand critical ESG issues and the role Walmart can play to help address them. We have created and engaged with several advisory councils to offer critical input on Walmart's business and ESG practices and initiatives. These include, among others, the Living Green Working Group, comprised of representatives of environmental NGOs, and the Workforce Advisory Council, which is made up of experts in workforce development. Working with third-party advisory councils enables us to benefit from an array of expertise and opinions and helps us shape our business initiatives.
We also seek to promote ecosystems and networks that allow grantees to multiply their impact by learning from and supporting one another. Learn more about our philanthropy and the Walmart Foundation at Walmart.org.
ESG research analysts
We have ongoing conversations with ESG analysts and researchers. We interact with ESG analysts holding a variety of viewpoints on our company, and these diverse perspectives inform our initiatives and help make us more effective.
In these conversations, we discuss Walmart's strategy, governance practices, compliance programs and other ESG-related matters.

On June 20, 2019 Walmart announced that we entered into a global settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that resolves a more than seven-year investigation into the company's compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Additional information can be found in our press release. Since launching our internal review in 2011, Walmart has taken actions over the years to enhance our Global Anti-Corruption Program and several of these were recognized by the DOJ and SEC:
 Hiring dedicated home office and market-level anti-corruption compliance leadership including a Global Ethics and Compliance Officer, an International Ethics and Compliance Officer, and a Global Anti-Corruption Officer;
 Enhancing the company's Global AntiCorruption Training and Awareness Program;
 Enhancing internal controls on the selection and use of third-party intermediaries who interact with government officials on Walmart's behalf;
 Terminating business relationships with third parties involved in the conduct at issue.
All content pertaining to the FCPA ruling was added to the 2019 ESG Report on July 1, 2019. As noted above, the ruling was announced on June 20, 2019, after the original ESG report was published on May 7, 2019.

ENDNOTES
1 The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is a collaboration between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and is one of the We Mean Business Coalition commitments. The SBTi validated Walmart's greenhouse gas emissions reduction target as science-based in November 2016, indicating that the target is in line with the level of decarbonization required to keep global temperature increase below 2 C compared with pre-industrial temperatures.
2 Based upon total average Index scores achieved by participating suppliers in categories where the Index is available in calendar year 2018 as compared to 2016.
3 Decline in emissions (Scope 1 and 2) between 2015 and 2017 is adjusted for most recent grid factors. On an unadjusted basis (as reported to CDP, using grid factors available in the year of reporting), the decline was 11.2%. Measurement accounts for changes in majority-owned subsidiaries over time through corresponding adjustments to baseline and year of measurement.
4 Based on review of material handling and waste diversion processes in Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, U.K. and U.S., as reported by waste vendors, food banks and stores. In cases where real numbers were not available due to industry challenges, they have been estimated based on industry acceptable standards.
5 This considers the combined contribution of the renewable energy credits and power generated from on-site and off-site projects, as well as renewable energy that we receive from utility-owned renewable generation feeding into the grids where our sites are located. At the time this report was prepared, calendar year 2017 was the most recent year for which we had third-party-verified energy consumption data. This was used in combination with the electricity procured from our renewable energy projects in 2018 and the most recent grid fuel mix information obtained from the International Energy Agency for the regions where we operate.
6 Zero waste is based on the requirements and definition from the Zero Waste International Alliance (ZWIA) business recognition program. The ZWIA definition of zero waste is achieving 90% or more diversion of all discarded resources from landfills, incinerators and the environment. Zero waste goal and reporting scope includes waste materials and products generated in Walmart's owned facilities and its operations (stores, clubs, warehouses, return centers, truck maintenance garages, etc.).
7 Decline in emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) between 2015 and 2017 is adjusted for most recent grid factors. On an unadjusted basis (as reported to CDP, using grid factors available in the year of reporting), the decline was 11.2%. Measurement accounts for changes in majority-owned subsidiaries over time through corresponding adjustments to baseline and year of measurement.
8 Annual Scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon intensities correspond to the results we disclose in response to the annual CDP climate change questionnaire and can be downloaded from the CDP website. The methodology is in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, meaning we use the latest available emissions factors for energy grids at the time of annual reporting to CDP. As a result, emissions reported to CDP in any given year are subject to the grid factors available in the year of reporting. Lucideon CICS independently verified Walmart's reported Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, pursuant to ISO 14064-3 (the international standard for verification of greenhouse gas inventories). For more details, please refer to Walmart's Greenhouse Gas Inventory Methodology attached to our CDP disclosures.
9 Carbon intensity (Scopes 1 and 2 per revenue) calculation is based on emissions reported to CDP for calendar year (Jan 1-Dec 31) and normalized by total annual revenues as measured by Walmart's fiscal year (Feb 1-Jan 31). The intensities correspond with the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions as reported in our annual CDP response and have not been adjusted for most recent grid factor updates.
10 Calculated in accordance with Walmart's Project Gigaton Accounting Methodology available on the Walmart Sustainability Hub.
11 Calculated in accordance with Walmart's Project Gigaton Accounting Methodology available on the Walmart Sustainability Hub. We previously reported year one results as "more than 20 million metric tons"; the exact figure was 21,518,699 metric tons, plus 13,233,733 of "roll-forward" emissions which were not publicly reported and are retroactively being added to the year one total in line with the clarified temporal allocation procedures described in the Project Gigaton Accounting Methodology.
12 The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is a collaboration between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and is one of the We Mean Business Coalition commitments. The SBTi validated Walmart's greenhouse gas emissions reduction target as science-based in November 2016, indicating that the target is in line with the level of decarbonization required to keep global temperature increase below 2 C compared to pre-industrial temperatures.
13 Decline in emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) between 2015 and 2017 is adjusted for the most recent grid factors. On an unadjusted basis (as reported to CDP, using grid factors available in the year of reporting), the decline was 11.2%. Measurement accounts for changes in majority-owned subsidiaries over time through corresponding adjustments to baseline and year of measurement.
14 This considers the combined contribution of the renewable energy credits and power generated from on-site and off-site projects as well as renewable energy that we receive from utility-owned renewable generation feeding into the grids where our sites are located. At the time this report was prepared, calendar year 2017 was the most recent year for which we had third-party-verified energy consumption data. This was used in combination with the electricity procured from our renewable energy projects in 2018 and the most recent grid fuel mix information obtained from the International Energy Agency for the regions where we operate.

21 Zero waste is based on the requirements and definition from the Zero Waste International Alliance (ZWIA) business recognition program. The ZWIA definition of zero waste is achieving 90% or more diversion of all discarded resources from landfills, incinerators and the environment. zero waste goal and reporting scope includes waste materials and products generated in Walmart's owned facilities and its operations (stores, clubs, warehouses, return centers, truck maintenance garages, etc.).
22 Based on review of material handling and waste diversion processes in Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, U.K. and U.S., as reported by waste vendors, food banks and stores. In cases where real numbers were not available due to industry challenges, they have been estimated based on industry acceptable standards.
