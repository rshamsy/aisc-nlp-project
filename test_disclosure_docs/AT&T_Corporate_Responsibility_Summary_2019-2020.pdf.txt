WE ARE DEFINED BY OUR COMMITMENT TO CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
RANDALL STEPHENSON Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

C OVID-19 has changed our world in profound and challenging ways, with major implications for how we congregate, work, learn, travel and interact. In such a world, the power of connectivity  keeping us in touch, informed and entertained  has never been more important.
At AT&T, we've been connecting people, communities and businesses for more than 140 years, and we take that responsibility very seriously. Thanks to the resilience of our people and our networks, we've weathered many crises over the decades. And every time, we've emerged stronger than before.
Whether they're in the field serving customers and maintaining our network, on the front lines putting their lives at risk to report breaking news, or at home remotely supporting key business operations, AT&T employees are always there for our communities and for one another  giving their all to continue providing essential services.
To help ease the burden on the people who keep our company strong, we took a number of steps, including bonuses for front-line employees and managers, as well as temporary paid family leave to help all employees cover a broad range of COVIDrelated needs. And our Employee Relief Fund  a 501(c)(3) public charity supported by employee donations and matching grants from the AT&T Foundation  is helping

colleagues experiencing financial hardship due to circumstances beyond their control.
We also launched a $10 million Distance Learning and Family Connections Fund to help give parents, students and teachers tools for at-home learning. We've temporarily extended service and waived late fees for customers who let us know they needed help as a result of coronavirus disruptions. And we offered additional news, educational and entertainment channels for free to our customers during this time.
The work we do is critical to millions of people around the world, and we're committed to being there when our colleagues and communities need us most.
Through FirstNet, we're providing advanced connectivity to the true heroes  first responders, healthcare providers, government agencies, military, police, fire and EMS. As a public safety partner, it's an honor to serve and support them. We've also helped provide meals to those on the front lines and are using our texttodonate capabilities to encourage others to contribute.
The events of 2020 have also highlighted the critical need for society to do better for our Black neighbors and colleagues. The deaths of George Floyd, Breonna

Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and far too many others expose deep-rooted injustices that continue to impact the Black community. We can and will help address systemic racism by supporting law enforcement reform and enhanced access to education, health care and economic opportunities for underserved communities.
AT&T has long been committed to advancing social and racial equality and inclusion, and we know there is much more work to do. We believe it's a moral and business imperative for large companies to speak up when people are treated unfairly, to help influence needed policy change and to be an example for others by encouraging frank dialogue and learning among employees and community partners.
I'm proud of how our employees and our company have been there for our communities when they've needed us most. In addition to leadership on critical issues affecting society, we continue to encourage people not to text behind the wheel of a vehicle. We're working to address climate change as one of the top U.S. purchasers of renewable energy, and we're adopting science-based targets for our operations and supply chain. We remain committed to skills-building for our current and future employees. And we're active in our communities, providing hands-on support through corporate giving, the AT&T Foundation and the generosity of our employee volunteers.

AT&T's historic commitment to doing business responsibly  and to our values of living true, being there, and making a difference  is foundational to who we are as a company and as individuals. Our strong governance structure will continue to guide and support these efforts, proving that great things can happen when we all come together to address important issues facing our communities and our world.

WE ARE HERE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
CHARLENE LAKE Senior Vice President, Corporate Social Responsibility and Chief Sustainability Officer

D espite how unpredictable things may be today, AT&T's desire to positively impact our world has helped sustain our company for generations. Through our leadership in telecommunications and the inherited legacy of our WarnerMedia brands, AT&T delivers essential services, entertains, informs and fosters innovation.
Our employees are the soul of our efforts. Whether shaping the next generation of technology or pushing the boundaries of purposeful storytelling, they never stop dreaming. We share an unwavering pledge to serve customers and support our neighbors through selfless volunteerism and dedication to important societal issues.

$200 million in programs that help our employees gain expertise in fields such as data science, coding and computer analytics. We also help cultivate the future talent pipeline for AT&T  and industry at large  by supporting skills development and career readiness in our communities.
For more than a decade, our AT&T Aspire initiative has been investing in projects and organizations that provide access to education and training for those who need it most. In these unprecedented times, we've reinforced our commitment and relationships to help provide parents, students and teachers the tools they need for home learning and resources to maintain meaningful connections when it's not possible to be together in person.

Long-term success requires us to be deliberate in our planning, but responsive to the needs of stakeholders and communities.
The dramatic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of our legacy programs, and how quickly companies can be called to act in times of need.
Because the core of our operations is considered essential by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security,1 we continue to ensure our workforce has the technical and leadership skills for the jobs of tomorrow. Each year we invest approximately

Today's societal issues also underscore the importance of localized, community support. That's where the passion and service of AT&T employees really delivers. Our employees lead AT&T BelievesSM, our grassroots effort that blends corporate financial support with sweat equity, and leverages our expertise, time and company scale to maximize impact. COVID-19 has heavily impacted our communities, so we've dedicated $5.5 million to help provide needed meals for first responders, medical personnel and others serving around the clock.
AT&T Believes volunteers also are working to promote social justice. For example, Believe AtlantaSM and Believe IndySM volunteers

are working to strengthen ties between law enforcement and the community. And Believe ChicagoSM and Believe Los AngelesSM are working to create opportunities for Black communities through hiring, education and skills development.
To help amplify critical messages in support of racial equity, our WarnerMedia brands are donating advertising inventory and production assistance to civil rights organizations. In fact, we're offering platforms to raise voices in many ways, such as our CNN town hall with characters from Sesame Street designed to help kids and families talk about race and inclusion.
While we're focused on today's critical issues, we're maintaining our commitments to help tackle the ongoing climate emergency. AT&T has signed agreements surpassing 1.5 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity, making us one of the largest corporate purchasers in the U.S.
To enhance the resiliency of our operations, our Climate Change Analysis Tool currently helps visualize climate-related risks to network infrastructure and operations in the southeastern U.S. up to 30 years into the future. And we're making the data sets we use available to external organizations conducting their own research.
In the pages of this report, you'll see how AT&T is delivering solutions to leading global challenges and working to ensure our

business  and our society  is prepared for a more resilient tomorrow.
We're proud of our efforts and collective impact over the past year. We know our work will never be done, and we are committed to the challenges that lie ahead. I welcome your feedback, questions and thoughts.

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted virtually every corner of the globe  upending commerce; temporarily closing schools, businesses and public areas; and disrupting the cadence of everyday life. At AT&T, we believe it's part of our civic duty to help keep our customers and communities connected.

T he ability to communicate is essential for consumers and businesses. Our services help friends, families and colleagues maintain important connections even when society may be urged to stay apart.
First Responders and Our Communities For first responders, doctors, nurses and others delivering vital services during a public crisis, reliable connectivity can be a matter of life and death. This type of event is exactly why the FirstNet platform was created.
When the U.S. hospital ship Mercy docked in Los Angeles to provide temporary care, AT&T activated a 1 gigabit connection within 24 hours of the ship's arrival and deployed a portable cell site nearby to increase capacity for the influx of first responders. In New York City, we helped equip hundreds of ambulances with FirstNet ReadyTM devices to enhance inter-agency communication. And because we understand that helping others around the clock can take a toll on those called to serve, AT&T supports FRONTLINEHELP.org, a free emotional wellness program for COVID-19 healthcare workers and first responders. We also committed $5.5 million to provide nourishing meals for front line workers and others in need impacted by COVID-19.

As the public seeks up-to-the-minute information on the pandemic and treatment efforts, millions look to AT&T for valuable news and updates. In March, CNN continued to be the #1 global news brand, reaching 362 million worldwide and 246 million in the U.S.  a record 75% of Americans, our biggest audience ever.2
Our Employees As the need for social distancing grew, AT&T implemented a sweeping work-fromhome policy. We authorized temporary compensation increases for employees on the front lines who can't do their job from home, and implemented guidelines to help keep them safe. And we committed more than $100 million to help WarnerMedia cast and crew while on production hiatus.
Company-wide, we temporarily increased available paid, excused time off to 160 total hours for quarantined employees testing positive or at higher risk for COVID-19, for parents or guardians of children whose school or daycare closed, and for primary caregivers of someone diagnosed with COVID-19 and unable to provide self-care.

HOW WE'RE RESPONDING

SMALL BUSINESS & INNOVATION As part of the Stand for Small coalition, AT&T is helping small businesses in the U.S. maintain their vital role in our communities and economy. The coalition provides valuable offers and tools as business owners work to reduce operating expenses, manage teams remotely and enhance their digital capabilities during the pandemic. We also joined the Open COVID Pledge initiative, offering free temporary licenses for AT&T patents that might aid in the fight against COVID-19.3

CHILDREN & FAMILIES We've collaborated with Sesame Workshop to expand its Caring for Each Other initiative, to help kids and caregivers face challenges such as the do's and don'ts for face coverings, illness of a family member and transitioning to a new normal. Cartoon Network also launched CNCheckIn, a platform where popular characters share tips like how to social distance with friends.

DISTANCE LEARNING AT&T launched a $10 million Distance Learning and Family Connections Fund to support online learning and help family and friends stay connected. We're working with groups such as Khan Academy, Caribu and the SETDA Coalition for eLearning. And we've added the ESCUELA+ learning channel for DIRECTV customers in all Spanish-speaking parts of Latin America.

CUSTOMER CONNECTIVITY As a participant in the Keep Americans Connected Pledge, through at least June 30, 2020 we temporarily kept our public Wi-Fi hotspots open for anyone who needed them and temporarily suspended broadband overage fees for home internet and Fixed Wireless Internet customers. We temporarily waived late payment fees and termination of service for any wireless, home phone or broadband residential or small business customer notifying us of payment concerns resulting from the pandemic. For this period, we also extended availability of low-cost home internet access for qualifying households through our Access from AT&T program.

Millions worldwide depend on AT&T to stay connected. In the face of disruption or disaster, our ability to respond quickly and effectively is critical to protecting our workforce, maintaining essential operations and serving our customers.

FIRSTNET

T he U.S. Department of Homeland Security includes the communications industry among 16 critical infrastructure sectors. At AT&T, we design our network and operations to be resilient  so we're prepared to provide essential communications and data connectivity for our customers and communities.
Our global team of certified and experienced business continuity experts, led by our President of AT&T Network Engineering and Operations, works to maintain operations of key business processes by utilizing documented business continuity strategies, plans and procedures that are updated and exercised on an annual basis. Regular reports on our business continuity efforts are shared with the Audit Committee of the AT&T Board of Directors.
Our Business Continuity Management Program is certified to the international business continuity standard ISO 22301:2012. It's also aligned with the Disaster Recovery Institute International Professional Practices, Business Continuity Institute Good Practice Guidelines, U.S. Department of Homeland Security National Incident Management System and ISO 31000. Alignment with such standards demonstrates that AT&T is

equipped to maintain business operations and serve our customers in the vital hours, days or weeks after disaster strikes.
Maintaining Operations AT&T employees are essential to the continuity of our operations during the unexpected. When the situation requires us to decentralize to help ensure the health and safety of our workforce, many of our employees are able to work remotely using the same network access and web conferencing tools we provide customers  maintaining collaboration among our teams while providing secure access to the systems and applications available at the office. Virtual work helps us ensure critical business functions continue, even in unpredictable circumstances.
To help ensure the resilience of the AT&T network, our systems collect billions of service-assurance measurements across our wired and wireless infrastructure every hour, informing us of events such as unforeseen outages or spiking bandwidth demands. We analyze this data in near real time, 24/7, to help optimize performance. If disruption occurs, network technicians  and if needed, our Network Disaster Recovery personnel and fleet  are deployed to rapidly restore communications to affected areas.

FirstNet is the only nationwide wireless broadband communications platform dedicated to America's first responders and public safety community. Built with AT&T in a public-private partnership with the First Responder Network Authority, FirstNet provides first responders a reliable, highly secure nationwide wireless network  giving firefighters, law enforcement, paramedics, 911 offices and others unthrottled connectivity to

coordinate emergency response plans across agencies and jurisdictions.
FirstNet subscribers also have access to a dedicated fleet of deployable cell sites and network assets that can support disaster sites, quarantine zones, airports, and emergency operations or other public safety centers.

HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

We rely on our ability to attract, educate and retain talented people. With employees in more than 60 countries, our workforce mirrors the rapidly evolving global economy, requiring us to continually balance how we help current workers and future generations prepare for success.

A T&T invests approximately $200 million in employee education and training each year, to actively engage current employees and ensure they have the tools needed for the future. We offer multiple avenues to gain expertise in high-demand areas such as data science, coding and computer analytics. And we combine internal resources  like our award-winning AT&T University curriculum  with external programs from organizations like the University of Notre Dame, Udacity and LinkedIn Learning. Participants can earn short-term badges, Nanodegree credentials, master's degrees and other achievements.
As part of our commitment to workforce development, we created a continuous learning model that helps employees take control of their career growth. In 2019, we developed a skills assessment tool that uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to help employees see what jobs are available within the company, the skills required for each position and whether demand in that particular area is projected to grow or shrink in the years ahead.
In addition to fostering employee skills growth, we continually evolve our compensation

ENGAGEMENT BOOSTS RETENTION

AT&T also offers an Employee Assistance Program, which provides confidential assistance to employees who may be experiencing work-related or personal issues affecting their quality of life. And the AT&T Employee Relief Fund is available to help provide financial support for our employees in times of unforeseen need. Funded by employee donations and matching grants from the AT&T Foundation, the 501(c)(3) public charity helps colleagues experiencing

challenges beyond their control  including natural disasters, house fires or unexpected family death.

We strive to create an inclusive workplace that is as diverse as the communities we serve  working across cultures, geographies and languages. Doing so ensures a broad range of perspectives, helps attract and retain the best talent, and brings deeper insight into our global customers and partners.

O ur commitment to diversity and inclusion starts at the top and is embedded at every level of our organization. We believe the composition of the AT&T Board of Directors (Board) should encompass a broad range of backgrounds, industry knowledge, skills and expertise relevant to AT&T's business. In addition, our Board includes 3 women and 3 people of color.

Latino, Native American, LGBTQ+ individuals, people with disabilities, military veterans, parents, multigenerational  and individuals with similar professional interests such as engineering, project management, and media and entertainment technology. Several of our employee groups, such as Mujeres en Accin and Pulse of India, specifically engage employees outside the U.S. And all AT&T employees are welcome to join any of our employee groups.

Our investment in the success of people of all races, ethnicities and genders is reflected not only in the diversity of our Board, but also our company's management and workforce. Our U.S. management employees are 36% female and 39.4% people of color; and our overall U.S. workforce is 33.2% female and 44.8% people of color.
To create a culture of inclusion in our workforce, we encourage employees to join one or more of 50+ employee groups. These groups support the company's commitment to diversity and inclusion  through efforts in the workplace, marketplace and community  while focusing on members' professional development and opportunities for community service.

Leaders across the public and private sector identify climate change as an ongoing risk to global commerce. AT&T is acting alongside other companies to help address climate change by drawing down our global emissions and fortifying operations to be resilient in the face of future climate impacts.

Energy Efficiency Even as customer demand for data and bandwidth has increased dramatically, we've reduced our global Scope 1 and 2 emissions (those from operations and energy consumption, respectively). Our electricity consumption relative to data traffic has decreased 80% from a 2013 baseline, and we realized $39.8 million in annualized energy savings from approximately 26,700 energy efficiency projects completed in 2019.
Scenario-Based Planning To help ensure our future climate resilience, we're identifying risks to the company and adapting our operations where necessary. Collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory led AT&T to develop an industry-leading Climate Change Analysis Tool, which will help visualize climate change risk to our infrastructure and operations in the southeastern U.S. up to 30 years into the future. Such scenario-based analysis will enable us to better plan for maintenance, construction and disaster recovery needs.
We believe everyone can benefit from a better understanding of climate risk. That's why we're working with Argonne National Laboratory to make the climate datasets we use available to the public, to help local communities prepare. Through the AT&T Climate Resiliency Community Challenge, we're providing financial support to 5 universities in the southeastern U.S. as they partner with local governments to conduct climate risk analyses using the data shared by AT&T.

"Even as customer demand for data and bandwidth has increased dramatically, we've reduced our global Scope 1 and 2 emissions."
External Collaboration Our technology can also play a role in reducing emissions beyond our company. That's why we committed to helping enable customer GHG emissions savings 10 times the footprint of our operations by 2025. In our most recent progress report, customer-specific case studies detail how we've reached more than 20% of this goal.
We also collaborate with a number of global organizations. A member of our CSR team serves on the board of the Global e-Sustainability Initiative, and we are a founding member of both the Net Positive Project and Ceres' Corporate Electric Vehicle Alliance.

GREEN PRODUCTION

We implement sustainable practices on Warner Bros. (WB) and HBO sets. Each production designates a person who helps determine environmental goals and implements recommendations to incorporate environmentally-responsible materials, reduce waste and conserve energy. This includes utilizing LED set lighting, which is 85% more energyefficient than conventional methods.
In 2019, WB, HBO, CNN and TBS were recognized by the Environmental Media Association (EMA)  a non-profit dedicated to environmental progress in the entertainment industry  with 19 EMA Gold Seals and 29 EMA Green Seals for progress in sustainable production and 4 EMA Award nominations, including 2 wins, for environmental messaging in content.

When a production wraps, we donate surplus items to non-profit community partners. In 2019, WB contributed more than 34,000 meals, 1,500 pieces of furniture and 34,000 articles of clothing to 66 nonprofits. HBO donated 24,000 meals and distributed wardrobe and household items to underserved communities in Los Angeles and New York City.

New technologies, including AI, virtual reality (VR) and the Internet of Things (IoT), are changing how we live, work and engage with the world. Broad deployment of 5G wireless technology will dramatically increase adoption of these solutions, as carriers work to deliver a faster, more responsive network experience to an immense number of users and connected devices.

W e're continuously building out our wireless and wired networks to enhance reliability, coverage, speed and overall performance for consumers and businesses. Since 2015, we've invested more than $135 billion in our networks  more than any other public company in the U.S. Through these investments, AT&T is helping lead the shift to 5G, which we expect will bring significant economic, social and environmental benefits.

Public Safety AT&T supports smart city initiatives throughout the country to help city planners improve safety and sustainability for citizens. With connected IoT technology, we enable solutions that help streetlights self-report outages, track air quality and even detect gunshots in the area. In San Jose, Calif., we worked with the city to place Wi-Fi extenders and smart lighting controllers in 14 parks to provide internet access, help improve public safety and reduce the city's energy use.

IoT and video intelligence enable near realtime situational awareness from the remote

monitoring of things such as objects, traffic and people (with privacy protection) to help improve municipal security, efficiency and safety.
Healthcare XENEX germ-zapping robots connected with AT&T IoT technology are using intense pulsed xenon ultraviolet light to deactivate viruses, bacteria and spores on surfaces and help hospitals avoid infections and save lives. High-speed, lower-latency 5G networks using millimeter wave spectrum ("5G+") can also help make telemedicine more effective by allowing clinicians to conduct virtual patient visits while downloading an entire MRI scan in seconds. And AT&T is helping VITAS Healthcare, an endoflife care provider, explore the benefits of 5G-enabled VR content to help ease pain and anxiety among terminally ill patients.
Education AT&T is working to deploy 5G at Deloitte's Dallas-area training center, where

development programs plan to use augmented reality and VR-based curricula to help make education more immersive and engaging. We're also working with the University of Miami to deploy 5G and Multiaccess Edge Computing on its Coral Gables campus, to help support innovative teaching and research methods.
AI at AT&T By combining machine learning with human expertise and experience, AT&T is using AI to fight fraudulent behavior and robocalls on our network and to improve customer service and field technician responsiveness. AI and machine learning also contribute to the ongoing development of our Climate Change Analysis Tool, which analyzes millions of data points to model climate-related scenarios that could affect our business operations for several decades.

AI GUIDING PRINCIPLES
At AT&T, AI and machine learning are woven into our customer interactions, technology development and our planning for the future. We've adopted a set of principles that guide our decisions for using AI in our business:

BY PEOPLE, FOR PEOPLE We incorporate human
oversight into applications of AI. By keeping people at the core, AI can enhance
our workforce, expand capabilities and benefit
society as a whole.

ACCESSIBLE AND SHARED We support open-source communities whenever
appropriate  to further access to technology, collaboration, standardization and participation in industry discussion.

SECURE AND ETHICAL We are grounded in ethics, safety and values at every stage of AI development and deployment, incorporating our privacy principles and
security safeguards.

We're committed to the digital safety and well-being of our customers and to sharing solutions, tools and resources to help everyone adopt safer digital habits.

O ur It Can Wait program, active in the U.S. and Mexico, has encouraged people to drive free of distractions for more than a decade. As causes for smartphone-related driving distractions have extended beyond texting to include social media, web surfing, selfies and video chatting, we've expanded our efforts to discourage all forms of smartphonedistracted driving  whether in a car or on a scooter. Through the end of 2019, more than 40 million people have taken the It Can Wait pledge to never drive distracted.
Digital and device safety no longer pertain just to when consumers use our products and services, but how they use them as well. We provide parents with resources to help guide their family's technology use and manage digital habits. The AT&T Secure FamilyTM app helps parents restrict children's mobile device use by location, time of day or type of content. Our ScreenReadySM program provides online resources for setting parental controls as well as tips on digital parenting. And our viewing platforms, including AT&T TV, DIRECTV and HBO Max, offer settings that help parents restrict unsupervised content.

BULLYING PREVENTION
As part of our commitment to digital safety and well-being, we're working to help prevent bullying before it starts. Through our Cartoon Network Stop Bullying: Speak Up campaign in the U.S. and CN Buddy Network campaign in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, we're inspiring kids to promote acceptance and kindness by advancing strategies to help everyone feel included.
Together with our employees and non-profit collaborators, we're also supporting initiatives that teach digital citizenship. As part of our AT&T Believes effort in Boston, we launched AT&T Positively DigitalSM, a program that helps teens address issues such as cyberbullying, online safety and diversity.

CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION
AT&T is committed to helping protect our customers and to helping customers protect themselves online. People of all ages are at risk when it comes to online safety, but users over the age of 60 are frequent targets for cybercrime. Cyber Aware is our information hub that provides tips to stay more secure online and avoid scams and fraud. We're also working with nonprofit organizations, such as The Oasis Institute and the Air Force Association, to support programs teaching cybersecurity skills to older adults.

Our approach to product responsibility also focuses on the content we create. We have depiction policies that govern aspects of feature films such as tobacco use, particularly for content of interest to younger audiences. And in 2019, guided by consumer warnings from groups such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Medical Association and the American Lung Association, WarnerMedia discontinued advertising from tobacco and e-cigarette companies on our basic cable channels, such as TNT and TBS.
Our commitment to responsible, fair and accurate journalism guides our news business. Stories at CNN are thoroughly reviewed by producers and editors, and those involving particularly sensitive topics are further reviewed by a team of senior editors, standards and practices executives, and attorneys before

broadcast or publishing. In all cases, we hold our journalists to the highest standards of ethics, accuracy and integrity.
AT&T also strives to use our platforms to increase awareness of important causes. Through WarnerMedia, DIRECTV and Xandr, we donate airtime to qualifying non-profit and government organizations for public service announcements. In 2019, we introduced It's OK, an initiative encouraging conversations around mental health issues. On select HBO episodes, bumpers let viewers know whether mental health issues are depicted and list resources that can facilitate conversations for those seeking help.

Data helps us create more reliable products and services, improve security and detect fraud, and provide customers with customized offers. But customers count on AT&T to protect their information and respect their privacy. We take this responsibility seriously and work hard to maintain their trust.

W e provide our customers with information  and choices  about how their data might be used. We publicly post privacy policies and give customers the ability to opt-in to some programs and say no to others. To help customers understand our practices, at att.com/privacy, we describe our technology and services in simple terms and provide a consolidated resource for privacy policies, rights such as those under the General Data Protection Regulation in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and a link to ask questions.
Our advertising unit, Xandr, optimizes media spend across TV and digital properties, for buyers and sellers. As part of our efforts to boost transparency, we offer an Online Advertising & Ad Tech Glossary to educate consumers on the advertising industry's many technical terms. We ensure the data Xandr collects does not reflect names, email addresses or other information that directly identifies a user. And Xandr never sells data from our platform pertaining to any individual that we know is a minor.

The AT&T Chief Privacy Officer is responsible for overseeing and enforcing the company's privacy principles, policies and commitments across all operating companies  regularly updating executive leadership and the AT&T Board of Directors about privacy-related topics.
"We believe that industry collaboration is an important way to reach agreement on the principles that should form the foundation of consumer privacy law."
Network and data security are critical components for protecting customer privacy. Our Chief Security Office (CSO) establishes global policy and programmatic requirements to ensure security is a part of every organization within the company.
AT&T has dedicated CSO professionals and additional department-level security specialists working across our business and around the globe.

OUR PRIVACY PRINCIPLES
TRANSPARENCY: We're open and honest about
how we use data.
CHOICE AND CONTROL: We give customers choices about
how we use their data.
SECURITY: We use strong safeguards to keep
customer data confidential and secure.
INTEGRITY: We do what we say.

In addition to our actions as a company, we believe one of the best ways to protect privacy is for our customers to follow strong digital security practices. We provide customers with information on how to maintain privacy, safety and security in an increasingly connected world.
Beyond our operations, we advocate for consumer privacy protection in public policy. As a member of the Digital Due Process Coalition, AT&T joins U.S. companies, think tanks and other privacy advocates to campaign for the simplification and unification of the legal standards in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. AT&T also advocates for the adoption of U.S. federal consumer privacy legislation ensuring a unified approach to privacy, data security and breach notification that is consistent with Federal Trade Commission standards.

We believe that industry collaboration is an important way to reach agreement on the principles that should form the foundation of consumer privacy law. We participate in the Freedom Online Coalition's Advisory Network, IAB Europe's Transparency and Consent Framework and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Privacy Guidelines Expert Group. We also regularly engage with the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Future of Privacy Forum, the Information Accountability Foundation, Access Now, Red en Defensa de los Derechos Digitales, ARTICLE 19 and RightsCon.

AT&T has a longstanding commitment to human rights that is embedded throughout our operations and managed by a committee of senior executives from across the business. We operate with transparency, engage with stakeholders and promote responsiveness and accountability around human rights issues.

We're following guidance from the United Nations, including the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, as we plan future infrastructure investments. In 2020, we're conducting similar internal assessments across Latin America and will use the results to optimize our business practices.

I n 2019, we updated the AT&T Human Rights Policy by evaluating the work of our peers and identifying best practices across industries. Our approach is informed by international bodies and human rights frameworks such as the International Labour Organization, OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Last year, AT&T became the first U.S.-based telecommunications service provider to join the U.N. Global Compact to promote accountability and stakeholder dialogue in the areas of human rights, labor and the environment.
AT&T's Human Rights policy reflects considerations for all our operating companies. For instance, WarnerMedia's integration into our business reinforced our historical commitments to a free press, journalistic integrity, freedom of expression and broad accessibility of information.
The AT&T Human Rights Policy also reflects our commitment to human rights due diligence. For example, a recent internal human rights assessment in Mexico informed us of sensitivities to placing cellular infrastructure on indigenous land.

"WarnerMedia's integration into our business reinforced our historical commitments to a free press, journalistic integrity, freedom of expression and broad accessibility of information."

The size and scale of our operations allow us to be a leader in protecting human rights around the world through numerous industry collaborations. As a member of the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC), AT&T works alongside 17 global telecommunications companies to help ensure our suppliers are operating in accordance with our corporate social responsibility and human rights expectations.

CONNECTING FAMILIES
We recognize our services can play a role in promoting human rights around the world, and we developed a program in accordance with the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. The initiative supports unaccompanied migrant children fleeing violence in their home countries with free telephone calls to let family at home know they are safe.

AT&T is also an active member of Tech Against Trafficking, a coalition of technology companies and global experts who seek to eradicate human trafficking through the use of technology. We formed an internal Online Safety Committee in 2019 to assess the risk of online child exploitation across our operating companies and to explore opportunities to include prevention efforts in our corporate responsibility initiatives. And in 2020, we are undertaking a comprehensive assessment of all business operations to ensure consistent, rigorous policies and practices are in place to protect children from exploitation.

CSR GOVERNANCE & LEADERSHIP

Our commitment to addressing environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues is embedded at every level of the company. It includes Board of Directors oversight, officerlevel engagement and teams of dedicated corporate responsibility professionals who engage leaders across the business.
Board of Directors Oversight The Public Policy and Corporate Reputation Committee (PPCRC) of the AT&T Board of Directors oversees our corporate responsibility work, including volunteerism, philanthropy, education, privacy, diversity and inclusion, advocacy, environmental policy, ESG reporting, and disclosures of political contributions and government data requests.
The PPCRC also oversees our policies for philanthropic giving, which include corporate contributions approved by the AT&T Contributions Council and grants approved by the AT&T Foundation. The Contributions Council and AT&T Foundation are comprised of senior executives charged with the supervision of our philanthropic investments.
Members of the PPCRC come from diverse professional backgrounds, giving them the experience, depth of knowledge, judgment and vision needed to provide insight and guidance on policies and practices  as we work to address the breadth of ESG issues that can impact a complex enterprise like AT&T. They push us, challenge our assumptions and improve our work.

In addition to discussions with individual PPCRC members throughout the year, our Chief Sustainability Officer formally presents at scheduled committee meetings 3 times annually. With committee member guidance, we seek continuous improvement in areas such as climate resilience, privacy, political engagement, philanthropic giving, human rights, diversity, digital well-being and the education of our current and future workforce.
CSR GOVERNANCE

Additional Board of Directors committees oversee activities that impact ESG topics. For example, the Audit Committee reviews our cybersecurity and financial risk exposures and steps to control such risks. The Audit Committee also oversees internal controls as well as our corporate compliance program. And the Corporate Development and Finance Committee oversees capital investments and our implementation of key technology decisions.

Foundational policies, including the codes of business conduct that govern our operating companies, put our values into action and detail our commitment to ethics, diversity, privacy, the environment and our communities. These guidelines and expectations inform how we do business and how we interact with customers, suppliers, our communities and each other.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

Stakeholder engagement is a critical part of our corporate responsibility governance, and we participate in regular dialogue and structured collaboration throughout the year.
Every 23 years, we systematically engage a broad sampling of internal and external stakeholders to identify and prioritize the most significant ESG impacts, risks and opportunities our company should address to help ensure long-term business success. This stakeholder engagement assessment provides insight into how AT&T should focus our resources, reporting and communications. We continuously monitor pressing and emerging ESG issues and current events, and prioritize programmatic and managerial efforts on those topics, as appropriate.
In 2019, we conducted our 5th such assessment  which represents our global operations including WarnerMedia and Xandr  using a combination of electronic surveys and live interviews. Nearly 1,000 stakeholders provided insights and helped prioritize 29 ESG topics. These participants represented virtually every aspect of our business, including AT&T employees and officers across our operating companies, business and consumer customers, investors, suppliers, distributors, government and non-government organizations as well as programmatic and community organizations.

Reputation Measurement AT&T has developed an instrument to survey stakeholders and assess their perceptions of our corporate reputation and brand. On a monthly basis, the system measures AT&T's overall reputation  or emotional attachment  among consumers who state they are familiar with our company's operations. We're able to measure interest and awareness of specific AT&T corporate responsibility programs and emerging social issues, and sample impressions of new programs under development.
Our measurements confirm that awareness of AT&T corporate responsibility efforts improves company reputation  which in turn positively affects key business metrics such as willingness to buy or recommend, and willingness to give AT&T the benefit of the doubt in times of difficulty.
Leadership Oversight The results of our ongoing stakeholder engagement efforts are reported to the CSR Governance Council and the Public Policy & Corporate Reputation Committee of the AT&T Board of Directors. The insights gained help guide our corporate responsibility strategy, improve business operations and policies, ensure transparent reporting, and prioritize programmatic investments and collaboration across the business.

In 2020, we plan to conduct assessments across our Latin American operations to gain additional, targeted insights that will further inform our work in those countries.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTING

Each year, we highlight ESG performance and progress toward publicly stated goals through robust corporate responsibility reporting.
Our objective is best-in-class transparency, and we strive to present data in a modular format that is responsive to a variety of stakeholder needs and interests. The governance of our reporting is internally validated by our Finance organization, and quantitative environmental measures (emissions and energy use) are externally assured.
Our corporate responsibility reporting website details AT&T's approach to stakeholder engagement, alignment to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) frameworks, our commitment to the CDP climate change disclosure and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, and our efforts to support the U.N. Global Compact and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
We publish detailed issue briefs describing how we manage 21 of our most important ESG topics, and discuss ESG efforts and achievements in a dedicated corporate responsibility section of our corporate proxy statement. In addition to our holistic corporate responsibility reporting, we publish regional GRI-aligned reports detailing efforts across our Latin American operations.
AT&T also publishes 2 annual diversity and inclusion reports detailing our commitment to

workplace diversity at AT&T and production diversity across WarnerMedia.
Through our biannual Political Engagement Report, we publicly disclose our involvement in the political process and our U.S. political contributions. Our political engagement decisions are grounded in our company values, codes of business conduct, AT&T public policy positions and the best interests of our business and employees  without regard to political party affiliation. The AT&T Board of Directors receives the full list of corporate political contributions and has an opportunity to review and provide guidance with respect to the company's contributions. In accordance with applicable law, campaign finance and disclosure rules, and our own internal policies, we also publicly identify organizations that report using some or all of our contributions for lobbying activities.
"AT&T was named one of the 10 most transparent S&P 500 companies for ESG reporting, according to a 2019 study commissioned by Financial Times' Agenda."
In 2019, AT&T scored 97.1 (out of 100) on the CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability, earning the organization's top "Trendsetter" designation. AT&T was also named one of the 10 most transparent S&P 500 companies for ESG reporting, according to a 2019 study commissioned by Financial Times' Agenda.

Like all companies, we're also required by law to provide information to government and law enforcement entities, as well as to parties to civil lawsuits, by complying with court orders, subpoenas, lawful discovery requests and other legal requirements. The AT&T Transparency Report provides data regarding the number and types of legal demands that compelled AT&T to provide information about communications or our customers as well as information permitted by law to be disclosed about Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act requests.

Enhance network efficiency to achieve a net-positive ratio between our operational footprint and the carbon reductions our technology makes possible for customers using our services.

Progress
Continuing emissions reductions We continue to reduce our GHG emissions through extensive energy efficiency efforts in our buildings and network, optimization of our vehicle fleet and through largescale renewable energy purchases. We also continue to leverage our technology to identify opportunities for additional improvements in operational efficiency.

Deliver customer solutions to achieve a net-positive ratio between our operational footprint and the carbon reductions our technology makes possible for customers using our services.

Enabled reductions 2.2x our footprint Our calculations have verified that through the end of 2018, AT&T technology has enabled customer GHG emission reductions approximately 2.2 times that of our operational footprint. We're working to enable far more emissions reductions than that, and we will continue to report our progress biannually.
